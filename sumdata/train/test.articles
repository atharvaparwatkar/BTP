A Republican House member shouted, "You lie" during President Obama's health care speech to Congress on Wednesday, and members of both parties condemned the heckling. Rep. Joe Wilson shouted "you lie" after President Obama denied the health care plan would cover illegal immigrants. After the speech, South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson issued a statement apologizing for his outburst. "This evening, I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the president's remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill," the statement said. "While I disagree with the president's statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the president for this lack of civility." Wilson also called the White House to apologize and spoke with Obama's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who accepted the apology on the president's behalf, according to a senior administration official. "We can disagree without being disagreeable," Emanuel said to Wilson, according to the official. "That was the point of the president's speech." The outburst came when Obama denied that proposed health care legislation would provide free health coverage for illegal immigrants. Immediately, Wilson shouted, "You lie!"  Watch the outburst and the chamber's response » The outburst caused Obama to stop and look toward the heckler. "That's not true," the president responded. Fact check: Will reform plan cover illegal immigrants? Behind him, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared shocked and turned toward the outburst as Vice President Joe Biden looked down and shook his head. Loud boos echoed through the chamber immediately after the outburst. While it was the most attention-getting, Wilson's shout wasn't the only demonstration of displeasure made by Republicans during the speech. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, wore a sign around his neck that said, "What bill?" And when Obama asked Republicans to share their health reform ideas with him, a small group raised up a stack of papers above their heads. After the speech, Republican Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate defeated by Obama last year, called Wilson's outburst "totally disrespectful" and said he should apologize. Appearing on CNN's "Larry King Live," he said there was "no place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately." Other Republicans also criticized Wilson, along with the expected Democratic condemnation. "It was crude and disrespectful," said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, a top Senate Democrat. "I think the person who said it will pay a price." Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, called on Wilson to go to the floor Thursday and apologize. She said Wilson's comment and other GOP tactics "strike me as odd. ... The minority leader has to get control of his conference." But Jackson Lee described Wilson as "a likeable guy, seemingly reserved" and said it was "rather surprising" when saw who shouted the comment. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, echoed the sentiment. "I was always taught that the first sign of a good education is good manners. I think that what we saw tonight was really bad manners," he said. "And, having a spirited debate is one thing, exercising bad manners is another. That was beyond the pale -- and I would hope that he would publicly apologize on that same floor to the president of the United States for that insult." Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan and ranking Republican on the Ways & Means Committee, told CNN Radio he wasn't happy with the outburst. "I don't advise that. ... I think it's important to listen as respectfully as possible," he said. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, also denounced the heckling. "Certainly, I respect the office of the president, and I think that's not the kind of thing that is appropriate in that kind of setting especially," he said. "I don't know who said it, but my sense is most people don't think it was a good idea it occurred. And I happen to be one of those." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN affiliate WIS-TV in Columbia that he, too, was disappointed. "The president's combative tone did not justify a member of Congress shouting out, 'You lie,' " said Graham. "Our nation's president deserves to be treated with respect. It was an inappropriate remark, and I am glad an apology has been made." South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Carol Fowler took it further, saying Wilson disgraced his home state. "Once again a South Carolina Republican has embarrassed our state," Fowler's office said in a statement that referred to S.C. Gov. Mark Sanford's extramarital affair. "Never has any member of Congress shown such disrespect for the president during a speech," Fowler wrote. "One would think that as a member of the military, Joe Wilson would have more respect and patriotism than he displayed tonight. When Congressman Wilson insulted President Obama, he also insulted the American public. Joe Wilson is a poor example of a statesman and an American. He owes an apology to the president and the American people." The Democrat hoping to unseat Wilson in next year's midterm elections also quickly seized on the Republican's outburst. "Rep. Wilson's behavior tonight exemplifies everything that is wrong in Washington," Democrat Rob Miller said in a statement provided to CNN. "Instead of engaging in childish name-calling and disrespecting our commander-in-chief, Joe Wilson should be working towards a bipartisan solution that makes quality, affordable health care available to each and every South Carolinian." iReport.com: Share your take on the speech, Wilson After the speech, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, tweeted that it was the "biggest" disappointment of the evening. "Biggest disappointmnt of evening, the total lack of respect shown by one member for the President," she wrote. "Never acceptable to behave like a jerk." Wilson, who has served five terms, represents the state's 2nd congressional district, which includes the state capital, Columbia, and stretches to Beaufort and Hilton Head Island.
Andy Murray recorded a double triumph on Tuesday to book his place in the last eight at Wimbledon, over opponent Marin Cilic and the dismal weather in London. After a day punctuated by rain delays on Monday, Murray was able to wrap up a 7-5 6-2 6-3 victory with just one interruption before damp conditions halted the action on all but Centre Court. Murray will now face Spain's David Ferrer -- who knocked him out of the recent French Open -- after the Spaniard defeated Juan Del Potro, from Argentina, 6-3 6-2 6-3. British No. 1 Murray said he was relieved to finish his clash against Croatian Cilic after a frustrating Monday in which play was suspended with the score 7-5 3-1. There was criticism of the tournament's organizers after Murray's match wasn't switched to Centre Court, which has a retractable roof, but he told reporters: "I honestly don't care which court I play on. "It makes no difference but obviously every player would rather be on Centre Court because you know you are going to get your match in regardless of the weather. "I don't think I deserve to play every match on Centre Court. It's just annoying when the weather is bad. "I haven't always dealt with rain delays that well in the past, so it's good experience for me. Probably from now on I will play on Centre so it won't be a problem." Ferrer, the No. 7 seed, breezed through his match on the sheltered showpiece court, defeating 2009 U.S. Open champion Del Potro in just under two hours. He told the ATP Tour's official website: "Today was one of my best matches [on a grass] court. But I'm not sure if is my best or not. At Wimbledon, there is a lot of wind. "On an indoor court, under a roof, it is easier for us to play. The ball does not move and this is more comfortable for us." Murray and Ferrer were joined in the quarters by German pair Philipp Kohlschreiber and Florian Mayer. Mayer, the No. 31 seed, reached the last eight at Wimbledon for only the second time after he defeated Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-3 6-1 3-6 6-2. His reward for reaching his first quarterfinal in eight years is a tie with world No. 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic. "It's an unbelievable feeling. Eight years ago I was here in the quarters, and now eight years later it's happened again. So it's a wonderful dream for me," Mayer told reporters. Kohlschreiber battled past U.S. qualifier Brian Baker 6-1 7-6 6-3 to make the last eight of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 33 attempts. The No. 27 seed will now play French No. 5 seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga after he recorded a 4-6 7-6 6-4 6-4 win over American No.10 Mardy Fish in another rain-hit match. "I'm very, very happy," said Kohlschreiber. "It's very tough to describe the real feelings. I'm very happy how I played. "Also, lucky, at the end, with the weather, that I could finish my match. It's just an amazing feeling. For sure I will celebrate. I have a lot of confidence now. I like the courts." The last quarterfinal sees 16-time major champion Roger Federer, the No. 3 seed, take on Russia's Mikhail Youzhny.
Prominent Chicago defense lawyer Ed Genson said Friday he intends to resign as attorney for embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in the criminal case against the governor. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's impeachment trial is scheduled to start on Monday. "I never require a client to do what I say but I do require them to at least listen to what I say. ... I wish the governor good luck and godspeed," Genson said in brief remarks to reporters. Genson would not elaborate on his reasons for withdrawing from the case or any conversations he had with Blagojevich about his leaving the case. Genson had headed Blagojevich's defense team since soon after the governor was arrested on December 9 on federal corruption charges. Among other allegations, federal prosecutors said the governor tried to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President Obama. Genson represented Blagojevich during proceedings in the Illinois state House in which legislators voted to impeach the governor. But on January 16, the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Illinois said Genson would not represent Blagojevich in his state Senate impeachment trial. No explanation was given. Blagojevich has denied any wrongdoing and said the House impeachment vote was politically motivated.  Watch Blagojevich ask for fair trial » On Thursday, the outspoken Blagojevich called the Senate trial "a sham" and said the Senate is not allowing him to call witnesses in the trial, which is scheduled to begin Monday. The Chicago Tribune reported that Genson said his inability to call witnesses or to know the identities of some parties in alleged schemes made it impossible to defend Blagojevich in the impeachment trial. After Genson announced Friday he would leave Blagojevich's criminal defense effort, another of Blagojevich's attorneys, Sheldon Sorosky, said he was continuing to work on the case. "I'm on the case, absolutely," Sorosky, whose law firm is separate from Genson's firm, said at an impromptu sidewalk news conference as he was leaving an office building. "I was aware of Mr. Genson's position, and he's a good friend," said Sorosky. "The governor's a friend, and I understand his position and that's that." iReport.com: Do you trust your political leaders? Sorosky, who has worked on Blagojevich's defense since the arrest, would not elaborate. Asked by a reporter if he would recommend to Blagojevich that the talkative governor curtail his public comments, Sorosky said, "You can't tell the governor what to do or not to do."
Lego boss Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, who pulled the iconic toy brand back into profit, says Europe needs to face up to its harsh economic reality. Knudstorp believes Europeans think they are wealthier than they are, despite three years of a global financial crisis. With the crisis continuing to roil markets and destabilize the banking sector, "it's about all of us recognizing that we have lost a bit of our wealth," he says. Lego lost its way in the late 90s and went deeply into debt before rebounding to double digit growth under Knudstorp's leadership. Knudstorp suggests European finance ministers could learn from Danish manufacturer's experience. "My piece of advice would be: face the truth -- that is what I learned the hard way in our company." Knudstorp says Lego went too deeply into debt, as Europe has also done. According to Knudstorp, stemming the crisis will begin by saying: "Yes we are over-indebted, we are sorry, we screwed up." He believes Europe needs to write-off some of its debt to avoid a stagnant economy for the next decade. "I think we are moving from a 30 year period of just borrowing more and more money at the government level and also at the household level," Knudstorp says. However, he says, Europe is entering a phase where raw material costs could increase while the availability for cheap labor around the world will decline. At Lego, Knudstorp will be focused on ensuring the company adapts to the changing economic conditions, which he believes are crucial to ensure survival. Lego is also renewing its portfolio of products, and plans to launch toys specifically designed for girls. But Knudstorp also emphasis the needs to keep things simple. "You need to challenge your organization all the time, to stay coherent, not make things too complicated," he says. "A lot of productivity is lost inside the company when things get complicated." CNN's Emily Smith has contributed to this report.
The military forces of Moammar Gadhafi on Friday pounded Ras Lanuf, the key oil port once in the hands of rebel forces, with its leadership confidently vowing to retake all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure. Even as it targeted its domestic enemies, the Tripoli government continued to parry with leaders around the globe. Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim, for instance, said Friday that Libya has suspended diplomatic relations with France, one day after the French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country. In Ras Lanuf, pro-Gadhafi forces cranked up an intense and steady bombardment of the city, believed to be by rocket, artillery and tank fire. A storage tank at an oil refinery was on fire after an air raid there. "We saw a bomb fall about a kilometer to the southwest of the refinery, and moments later saw thick black smoke rising from the refinery. We don't know, and no one we spoke to could say with any level of certainty or veracity, what caused the fire," said CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman. Dozens of pickup trucks and cars belonging to the opposition were heading away from the city amid fear that Libyan forces were advancing as the bombardment continued. The rebels evacuated to a checkpoint outside the town, but that and other rebel positions also were targeted by airstrikes. Rebels said the eastern city has been essentially empty as civilians fled and opposition forces retreated from sustained attacks. On Thursday, state media said the town was "cleansed" of the fighters. This reflects the turn in fortunes for Gadhafi's well-equipped military, which has gained an upper hand after rebel fighters seized ground across Libya. Along with its offensive in Ras Lanuf, government soldiers beat back rebels Thursday in Zawiya east of the capital, Tripoli. Zawiya's Martyrs' Square was littered with the bombed-out, scorched carcasses of army tanks and other military vehicles. Workers swept up the evidence as Gadhafi supporters chanted slogans and waved green flags. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, one of Gadhafi's sons and a spokesman for the regime, vowed Thursday to retake other areas in eastern Libya that were controlled by the opposition and warned the international community that Libyans won't welcome NATO and Americans. NATO is contemplating the establishment of a no-fly zone, but says it needs a clear U.N. mandate to do it. "I receive hundreds of calls from the east daily, and they are saying, 'Save us.' They are begging us and pleading for us to save them, and my answer is two words. Listen to me, and I want those armed groups to listen to me real well, and I want our people in the east to hear this as well: We're coming," he said. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi is one of two Moammar Gadhafi sons who share the first name Saif. On the diplomatic front, meanwhile, opposition to Moammar Gadhafi continues to gain momentum. U.S. President Barack Obama reiterated Friday that he wants the Libyan leader to "step down." He added that he "won't take (the) decision lightly" to decide whether to use military force, including helping enforce a no-fly zone, saying it is critical to "balance costs versus benefits." Obama noted that NATO officials will meet Tuesday to consider whether to implement a no-fly zone. He said U.S. actions so far, including freezing assets and other sanctions, are "slowly tightening the noose" on Gadhafi. "We have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions," he said. The U.S. Treasury Department beefed up those sanctions Friday, freezing the assets of nine more individuals. Among them are the wife and four sons of Libya's leader, including Saadi, Hannibal, Muhammad and Saif Al-Arab Gadhafi. Libya's defense minister, military intelligence director, external security organization head and public works coordinator are also included. Also Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon introduced former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib as his new special envoy to Libya. Khatib will leave New York over the weekend, accompanied by humanitarian and U.N. officials, to "convey, in no uncertain terms, the concerns of the United Nations and the international community," Ban said. "I (hope) that this effort ... will succeed in stopping the killings and ending the suffering of the civilian population, in addressing their humanitarian needs and in preserving the unity of the Libyan people and the territorial integrity of their homeland," Khatib said, adding that Gadhafi's government "welcomed" the visit. In Brussels, Belgium, the European Council, a body of the European Union, issued a declaration saying Gadhafi "must relinquish power immediately." "His regime has lost all legitimacy and is no longer an interlocutor for the EU. The European Union has adopted restrictive measures against the country's leadership and against entities holding sizeable assets controlled by the regime and stands ready to adopt further sanctions. "The objective is for Libya to rapidly embark on an orderly transition to democracy through a broad-based dialogue. The European Union welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi which it considers a political interlocutor." Some members are clearer than others in their support for the National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in his news conference that "we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged." German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious in her approach to the council and called them a possible interlocutor. Sarkozy said the European Council decision is a very strong one, and he stressed that a U.N. mandate and a request from the region are needed for intervention. "We are considering and examining all necessary options to deal with the situation," he said. "We cannot stand by and watch this happen." He wouldn't say whether France or Britain would take unilateral military action if a U.N. mandate wasn't achieved. British Prime Minister David Cameron said in Brussels that authorities are tightening "the net" on Gadhafi and "his henchman" with tougher financial sanctions. "We have added the Libyan Central Bank and the Libyan Investment Authority to the Libyan EU asset freezing list and, in doing so, the UK has frozen a total of 12 billion pounds of Libyan assets," Cameron said. On Friday, the Libyan ambassador to the United States and to the United Nations will call on the United States to follow France's lead and recognize the opposition as the legitimate representative of Libya. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced plans to meet with opposition leaders when she visits Tunisia and Egypt next week. She said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington, and an administration official added that the embassy "must shut down." Protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule, and the discontent devolved into a fierce and bloody civil war. Death toll estimates earlier this week ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000. As of Thursday morning, the war had forced out nearly 250,000 people, many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders, the U.N. refugee agency said.

which are controlled by Beijing but claimed by Hanoi -- since the previous Sunday, even accusing the Chinese of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannon. A rally, which drew around a thousand protesters in Hanoi Sunday, focused local ire on the Chinese embassy, while smaller protests in Danang and Ho Chi Minh City echoed the anti-Chinese sentiment emanating from the political capital. While public protests are rare in Vietnam, where the one-party system is wary of public gatherings, there have been several anti-Chinese protests in recent years. That this weekend's actions went ahead unobstructed by police is seen as a sign that the government tacitly approves of the protests. 'Provocative' decision The U.S. Department of State released a statement last week, calling China's decision to send the oil rig, accompanied by a flotilla of government vessels, "provocative," and an act that "raises tensions." "This unilateral action appears to be part of a broader pattern of Chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region," the statement said. The language was echoed by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in a telephone call this week between the diplomat and his Chinese counterpart. It also raised concerns about the conduct of the Chinese vessels in the area, calling some actions by Chinese ships "dangerous." Exclusion zone Relations between China and Vietnam soured on Friday, when a Chinese platform began drilling for oil near the Paracel Islands. The oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, is owned by state gas and oil company CNOOC. The Maritime Safety Administration of China (MSAC) declared a three-mile exclusion zone around the rig, while military vessels have been deployed to patrol the area. "At present, the number of escorting ships of China has reached 60, including military ships," Tran Duy Hai, Vice Chair of Vietnam's National Boundary Commission, said in a statement Wednesday. "These vessels have intentionally hit and collided with Vietnamese law enforcement ships, including those of the Maritime Police and Fisheries Control, causing damage in human and property." (sic) China maintains that its current drilling activities are legitimate and blames the Vietnamese for provoking the conflict. "The drilling activities of this rig are within China's territorial waters. The harassment by the Vietnamese side is in violation of China's sovereign rights," said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She did not confirm the boat collisions. According to CNOOC, a third of China's oil and gas resources are under the South China Sea, most of which it claims as its own, refuting rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei.
Actress Angelina Jolie, a longtime goodwill ambassador for the United Nations' refugee agency, will be headed to Turkey this week to visit Syrian refugees, Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Jolie is expected to arrive in Istanbul and head to Hatay on Friday, according to the ministry, which accepted an application for her visit on Wednesday. More than 8,000 Syrians have fled their country for Turkey to escape violence, including a military offensive in the Jisr al-Shugur area. Jolie was named a goodwill ambassador for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in early 2001 and has visited more than 20 countries "to highlight the plight of millions of uprooted people and to advocate for their protection." The U.N. office said her interest in "humanitarian affairs was piqued in 2000 when she went to Cambodia to film the adventure film 'Tomb Raider.' " Jolie has won numerous acting awards, including a best supporting actress Academy Award for her performance in 1999's "Girl, Interrupted." CNN's Yesim Comert contributed to this report
The jailed mayor of Hampton, Florida, resigned Tuesday as the embattled city of 477 residents fought to keep its municipal government functioning in the wake of a state audit that exposed rampant corruption and mismanagement. Barry Layne Moore had held office for just over a month when he was arrested in November in a sting operation in which he allegedly sold a single 30-milligram oxycodone pill to an undercover informant for $20. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. Gov. Rick Scott suspended Moore shortly after the arrest. But state lawmakers, including Sen. Rob Bradley and Rep. Charles Van Zant, are pushing to dissolve Hampton, saying the city, notorious for its speed trap along U.S. Highway 301, is too corrupt to govern itself. The audit, released last month, found 31 violations of Hampton's city charter, as well as violations of state and federal codes and laws. The allegations included nepotism, sloppy bookkeeping, and failure to maintain records, withhold payroll taxes or insure city vehicles. The audit also found $9,000 in questionable payments to the city clerk, $27,000 in questionable charges on a city credit card and $132,000 charged to an account at a BP gas station and convenience store across the street from City Hall. The city has been given 30 days to show it can put its house in order. If the lawmakers are not satisfied that progress has been made, they will proceed in the state legislature with a bill to dissolve Hampton's city charter. Among the conditions the city must meet: All current office-holders and employees must resign. The police chief, city clerk, and water manager already have quit, as has one of the five city council members, who are paid $125 a month. Others are likely to follow. The City Council meets Tuesday night. Moore's letter was short and to the point, stating, "I, Barry Layne Moore, being of sound mind and body, ask that you would please accept this letter as notification that I am leaving my position with the city of Hampton, effective immediately."
Licenses were awarded to 20 medical marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts, the first in the state after a voter-approved law went into effect in 2013, state officials announced Friday. The Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services said 100 finalists applied for licenses and were judged on how they served the public health, their security and strength of their business plans, as well as their focus on the ability to meet patients' needs. "Health officials designed a rigorous process for vetting applicants," said the statement, citing a process that included a selection committee that determined the ability of each applicant to "meet overall health needs to registered patients while ensuring public safety." The law went into effect January 1, 2013, and allows the department to register up to 35 nonprofit registered marijuana dispensaries. In addition to the 20 approved, eight other applicants were qualified but the proposed locations were rejected, the statement said. Those applicants will be able to reapply in other counties that do not have a licensed dispensary, according to the department. Patients who have a written certification from a physician for medical marijuana will be registered in an online system, according to the department. Medical marijuana dispensaries serve clients who suffer ills ranging from cancer to AIDS to chronic pain. Proponents say the drug's pain-relieving properties offer an alternative for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Eighteen states have either decriminalized or allowed medical marijuana in some fashion. While the state laws have allowed dispensaries to open, they remain illegal under federal law. Fourteen states allow dispensaries, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Cuban-state media on Sunday published photos of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro meeting with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Havana. Maduro arrived Thursday in Cuba to attend celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the start of the Cuban revolution. Castro wasn't at the ceremony, which was officiated by his brother, Cuban President Raul Castro. Fidel Castro has made infrequent public appearances following an intestinal illness in 2006 that forced him to step down. According to the official Cuban government site Cubadebate, Maduro gave Castro a painting by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who died in March of cancer, and Castro gave Maduro a letter for the heads of state who had attended the anniversary of the revolution. In the letter titled "I Lived to Fight," Castro mentions the recent scandal involving Cuban weapons discovered hidden on a North Korean freighter trying to cross the Panama Canal. "In recent days there were attempts to defame our revolution," Castro wrote, according to the Juventud Rebelde newspaper, which published the text of the letter. "Trying to make our head of state and government appear as if they were tricking the United Nations and other heads of state and were guilty of being two-faced." After Panamanian authorities seized the North Korean ship, Cuba admitted to sending MiG fighter jets, missiles and anti-aircraft systems aboard the ship, which also carried 10,000 tons of Cuban sugar. The arms, Cuba's Foreign Ministry said, were "obsolete" weapons to be repaired in North Korea and returned to the Caribbean island for defensive use. Panama has asked for assistance from the United Nations, United States and Britain to determine whether the shipment violated a U.N. ban on sending weapons to North Korea.
A rare letter written by Napoleon Bonaparte in English will go to the auction block in France on Sunday. The letter could fetch close to $100,000 in the auction in the French town of Fontainebleau, south of Paris. Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors "was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. "He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him," Chataigner said. The auctioneer said Napoleon picked up English relatively quickly and well. "I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written," he said. "There are very few mistakes apart from a few words which have two meanings in English." Napoleon learned the language in two or three years, Chataigner said. "He's really a very good student, although he was a good student in lots of fields so it's maybe not that surprising," he added.
All former U.S. presidents, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and a raft of global dignitaries are invited to the funeral next Wednesday of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Downing Street said Thursday. The guest list also includes representatives of the Reagan family, Nelson Mandela's family and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, alongside sitting British Prime Minister David Cameron. Any members of Thatcher's Cabinet who are still alive and members of the current UK Cabinet, as well as opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband, will also be asked to attend, Cameron's office said. Among those expected to come are F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president of South Africa, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and one of his predecessors, Brian Mulroney. Buckingham Palace has already confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, will be present. With full military honors, the funeral will rival those given to Diana, Princess of Wales and the Queen Mother. More than 2,000 invitations -- color-coded to indicate where the guests are to sit -- are being sent out, Cameron's office said. They are due to be mailed Friday. Details of the very formal dress code will be sent out with the invitations. St. Paul's Cathedral holds 2,300 people and is expected to be full on the day, Cameron's office said. Some friends of Thatcher have already said they will be absent. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is not planning to attend for health reasons, Vladimir Polyakov at the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow told CNN. Nancy Reagan, the widow of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, Thatcher's great political friend and ally, is also unable to attend, a spokeswoman said. "Mrs. Reagan is heartbroken over Baroness Thatcher's death and would really like to be there in person to pay her respects. Unfortunately, she is no longer able to make that kind of a trip so will not be attending the funeral," she said. Nancy Reagan has asked Fred Ryan, chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and a longtime personal friend, to represent her at the service. Downing Street confirmed that the Argentine ambassador to London had been invited, as have other envoys, in line with protocol. No other Argentine representatives have been invited, however, meaning President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will not be there. Fernandez has stepped up her rhetoric in recent months over the disputed Falkland Islands, known to Argentines as Las Malvinas. Thatcher waged a short, sharp war with Argentina over the Falklands in 1982 after Argentine forces invaded. The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, have been under British rule since 1833. Thatcher, who led the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 and was prime minister for 11 years, died of a stroke Monday at age 87. A towering figure in postwar British and global politics, she is remembered in the world for her Cold War-era friendships with Reagan and Gorbachev, as well as her role in shaping Britain's place in Europe and her leadership during the Falklands War. She was on the wrong side of history when it came to South Africa, however, having opposed economic sanctions against the apartheid regime and described Mandela's Africa National Congress as a terrorist organization. Mandela and de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for their efforts to end apartheid. Security concerns Back at home, Thatcher was a highly polarizing figure in British politics. Police are stepping up security ahead of the funeral, amid concerns that protesters angered by Thatcher's actions in office may take to the streets. Many Britons blame her for creating soaring unemployment, when she reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to businesses and took on unions. Her battle with striking coal miners won her few friends in mining communities in northern England and Wales. But supporters believe the tough reforms she pushed through transformed the British economy and gave many working people new freedoms. London's Metropolitan Police, the City of London Police, who cover the city's financial district, and the British Transport Police are working together "to ensure that events that day pass off safely," a statement said. Police officers will be deployed along the route, with other mobile groups ready to be deployed to any outbreaks of trouble, the Met Police said. The force has urged anyone planning protests to let police know ahead of time. "There has been much speculation about what levels of protest may take place. I would ask anyone who wishes to demonstrate then, or in the coming days, to come and talk to us," Commander Christine Jones said. "The right to protest is one that must be upheld. However, we will work to do that whilst balancing the rights of those who wish to pay their respects and those who wish to travel about London as usual." Police will implement a range of security measures in line with the current threat level, Jones said. London's Evening Standard newspaper reported Wednesday that anarchists are planning to stage a mass "party" Saturday in Trafalgar Square to celebrate Thatcher's death. Ian Bone, founder of the Class War group, is quoted by the newspaper as saying thousands of anti-Thatcher protesters will gather from across the country for the event. They'll include miners and steel workers scarred by her battle with the unions, he said. Trafalgar Square, in the heart of London, was the scene of violent rioting in 1990 against a hugely unpopular tax brought in by Thatcher. The so-called poll tax was levied on community residents rather than property. A post on what appears to be Bone's blog also calls on people to attend the "Class War Party" in Trafalgar Square. "Best night out since the poll tax riot," it promises.

A day before embarking on a trip to Latin America, President Obama described his planned talks with Latin American leaders as discussions among equals. President Obama refuses to criticize Latin American leaders. "Times have changed," Obama told CNN en Español Wednesday. Referring to his planned meeting later this week with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, he said, "My relationship with President Lula is one of two leaders who both have big countries, that we are trying to solve problems and create opportunities for our people and we should be partners. "There's no senior partner or junior partner." Obama and Lula da Silva are among leaders scheduled to attend the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago. Obama refused to criticize the leaders of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, who have taken measures to change their constitutions to extend their holds on power. "I think it's important for the United States not to tell other countries how to structure their democratic practices and what should be contained in their constitutions," he said. "It's up to the people of those countries to make a decision about how they want to structure their affairs." Asked how he plans to interact with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a fierce critic of the United States who once described former President George Bush as the devil, Obama offered no criticism. "Look, he's the leader of his country and he'll be one of many people that I will have an opportunity to meet." Though he said he believes the United States has a leadership role to play in the region, Obama qualified that role, saying, "We also recognize that other countries have important contributions and insights. We want to listen and learn as well as talk, and that approach, I think, of mutual respect and finding common interests, is one that ultimately will serve everybody." Asked about Cuba, Obama, who recently eased restrictions on travel and sending money to the island, offered a prod and a carrot to Havana. "What we're looking for is some signal that there are going to be changes in how Cuba operates that assures that political prisoners are released, that people can speak their minds freely, that they can travel, that they can write and attend church and do the things that people throughout the hemisphere can do and take for granted," he said. "And if there is some sense of movement on those fronts in Cuba, then I think we can see a further thawing of relations and further changes." Obama sought to distance his administration from that of his predecessor, noting that he plans to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where "some of the practices of enhanced interrogation techniques, I think ran counter to American values and American traditions." He said his team has spoken with the Spanish government about a Spanish judge's call for an investigation into the role of Bush administration officials in the detention of five Spaniards at Guantanamo. But he did not dwell on his predecessor's legacy. "I'm a strong believer that it is important to look forward and not backward and to remind ourselves that we do have very real security threats out there." Though the U.S. image abroad may have suffered in recent years, "there's a reason why there are consistently so many immigrants to our country from Latin America," he said. Obama lauded Mexican President Felipe Calderon, with whom he is to meet Thursday in Mexico City, as having done "an outstanding and heroic job in dealing with what is a big problem right now along the borders with the drug cartels." He vowed that the United States can be counted on to help. "We are going to be dealing not only with drug interdiction coming north, but also working on helping to curb the flow of cash and guns going south," Obama said. Obama described himself as "a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform," and said he has met with the congressional Hispanic Caucus "to try to shape an agenda that can move through Congress."
At the end of another long and confusing day of political wrangling over extending the payroll tax cut, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi asked a question on everybody's mind. "The public has to be concerned and wondering why on Earth are we not getting a payroll tax cut when everybody says they're for it?" Pelosi, D-California, said at a news conference Tuesday. The answer involves the usual suspects of partisan divide in Congress and the politics of a coming election year. This time, though, there is another factor: disarray among congressional Republicans that has led to a public rift between GOP members of the House and Senate. On Tuesday, House Republicans pushed their call for further negotiations on a one-year extension of the payroll tax cut. They ridiculed a Senate plan for a two-month extension as irresponsible and unworkable, saying it would create uncertainty by failing to resolve the issue past February. However, the Senate agreement was negotiated by Democratic and Republican leaders and received strong GOP support in passing on an 89-10 vote. In effect, the criticism by House Republicans was directed at their Senate party brethren as well as Democrats, adding another twist to the reasons for the impasse. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, spoke with disdain on the House floor Tuesday about what he repeatedly referred to the "wisdom of the Senate" and asked his House colleagues to "look what the Senate did," calling the two-month extension plan "really irresponsible on all levels." Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, also took issue with the Senate plan, saying he had asked Senate leaders to send the House a proposal but when it arrived, "the House disagreed with it." Boehner's problem is that he initially urged his House colleagues to back the Senate measure, according to a GOP source who spoke of what happened in a conference call of the Republican House caucus Saturday. While Boehner referred to the Senate measure approved that day as the best deal the House would get, his top deputy -- House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia -- opposed it and urged the caucus to reject it, the source said. Boehner disputed that characterization of the caucus meeting, saying Tuesday he let Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell know of his disapproval of a short-term extension as the Senate negotiation approached finality. "I expressed my displeasure in once again taking the convenient route and not doing the people's work," said Boehner, who now leads the House Republican opposition to the Senate plan. Democrats have seized on the Republican disunity, noting that GOP leaders have blocked votes in both the House and Senate on payroll tax proposals backed by their party. "If we do not have a payroll tax cut, it's because the Republicans in the House of Representatives have chosen to paint themselves in a different place than Republicans in the country and Republicans in the United States Senate," Pelosi noted Tuesday. While House Republicans say they support a one-year extension of the payroll tax cut, the fact that they refuse to pass the Senate measure that would provide a two-month extension and more time to negotiate shows they have a different agenda, she said. 'Whatever they say is irrelevant," Pelosi said of House Republicans. "What they do is what's important, and what they're doing is not giving a payroll tax cut to 160 million Americans." President Barack Obama joined the Democratic chorus, noting that Senate leaders from both parties had agreed to the short-term extension in order to guarantee that taxes don't increase for working Americans while negotiations continue early next year on the one-year extension that House Republicans say they support. "What they're really holding out for is to wring concessions from Democrats on issues that have nothing to do with the payroll tax cut," Obama said of House Republicans. Another problem for Republicans is that they have blocked votes in both chambers on payroll tax-cut proposals they crafted or endorsed. House Republicans pushed through a bill extending the lower rate enacted last year through 2012, but tacked on other provisions opposed by Democrats and some GOP senators. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was against holding a Senate vote on the House plan, apparently because he knew it would fail. On Monday night, House Republican leaders ruled out a direct up-and-down vote on the Senate's two-month extension of the payroll tax cut. Instead, the House on Tuesday passed a procedural resolution that expressed disagreement with the Senate plan and called for a conference committee made up of members of both chambers to negotiate a compromise. Obama and House Democrats called for a direct vote on the Senate plan, with Pelosi saying the refusal by GOP leaders to bring it up showed they feared enough Republican members would join the Democratic minority to pass it. To CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, Republicans have been "outmaneuvered" on the issue. Obama and the Democrats have "put the Republicans in the House into a position where they look like they are clearly obstructing," Gergen said. The unresolved dispute continued to pit Republican versus Republican on Tuesday. Five mostly moderate Republican senators have called for the House to support the Senate's two-month extension. One of them, Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, issued a statement after Tuesday's House vote that said House Republicans "would rather continue playing politics than find solutions." "Their actions will hurt American families and be detrimental to our fragile economy," said Brown, who is facing a stiff re-election challenge in heavily Democratic Massachusetts next year. "We are Americans first; now is not the time for drawing lines in the sand." Veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who voted for the Senate's proposal, told CNN that the reality of the issue is that the payroll tax cut must be extended to help out Americans still struggling in the economic recovery. "It is harming the Republican Party," McCain said of the continuing impasse. "It is harming the view, if it's possible any more, of the American people about Congress."
Richard Holbrooke believed in Bosnia. As we mourn his passing, we also mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, the agreement that culminated his efforts in the Balkans. The physical damage of the war has been largely repaired. While many psychological scars linger, progress is evident in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ambassador Holbrooke knew that progress here was attainable. He was not only a great diplomat but also a true friend to our country. We should honor him by living out his dream for us to succeed and flourish as a nation. As we reflect on the past 15 years, there are still skeptics and critics who express their concerns about political stability. The country has challenges ahead, including the difficult task of changing its constitution. But the world should not have a short memory -- the political situation has improved tremendously since the official end of war on December 14, 1995. Tributes to Richard Holbrooke, architect of Bosnian peace Bosnia has signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and is well on its way to NATO membership. On December 15, the citizens of Bosnia will gain visa-free travel to the EU countries covered by the Schengen agreement. And Bosnia currently serves as a nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council and assumes its presidency in January 2011. That's a significant achievement for a post-conflict country. These are all clear signs of improvement. There is one key element required for further progress -- economic growth. Productive foreign investment will open markets, encourage stability and speed government reform. Bosnia's pre-war industries were destroyed, and a lack of domestic capital has meant that the country's export and hard currency earning potential in agriculture and food processing, lumber and wood working, hydroelectric power and tourism remain untapped. Most analysts expect foreign investment will be stimulated by the country's entry into NATO and eventually the EU. It is true that after the war, Bosnia entered into a transitional phase with a corrupt administration and an economic environment that discouraged foreign investment, but many difficulties with post-war corruption are behind us. The investment environment has improved with foreign investments peaking at $1.7 billion in 2007 just before the global recession. That's an impressive number considering Bosnia has only 4.6 million residents. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a stable macro-economic environment that includes a strong convertible currency, low inflation and the most developed banking system in southeastern Europe. The fact that investments in Bosnia and Herzegovina have grown indicates that investors have confidence in Bosnia, even before NATO membership, and these early investors will reap the greatest rewards. Bosnia will become a member of the EU, an ally of the west and follow the path of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. I was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina to an ethnically mixed family. After surviving the war, I immigrated to the United States in 1994. I lived for 14 years in Rochester, New York, started a family, studied business at Monroe Community College and electronic business management at Rochester Institute of Technology. My first job was as a stack clerk at the liquor store, and I later applied my schooling and worked in technology companies, higher education and for an industrialist, Dutch Summers, who later became one of the chief sponsors of American University. After gaining a valuable education and work experience, I decided that I wanted to return to Bosnia to help rebuild a country and region by providing others the opportunity I had to gain a quality education. I wanted to help the people of Bosnia and region to build better lives and a better future. With the support of people I had met during my time in the states, I started the American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina (AUBiH), partnering with State University of New York at Canton. In 2006, the school opened its doors with 21 students, and today AUBiH has more than 500 students at three campuses. Our goal was to overcome ethnic differences and allow young people to learn and work together to build the future of their country. We were committed to building a university with a multi-ethnic body of students who will be future leaders in business and government and who have a shared vision of the country's successful integration into Europe. We are building a work force of educated leaders for the new century will be able to support and implement investments in Bosnia. Their ability to prosper with expanded employment will drive the necessary reforms to modernize government. Bosnia is a relatively small market, but it offers some unique resources, a favorable geographic location and, as a member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement, access to millions of consumers in the region. And it offers a diaspora motivated to return and ready to help their homeland by taking positions in the government and opening their own businesses. The readiness of a new generation of Bosnians to commit to their country over a more comfortable life in the West is proof that young Bosnians are very optimistic about the nation. With increased investment and a new multi-ethnic generation of educated leaders Bosnia and Herzegovina will have the bright future Richard Holbrooke believed in.

Investigators in Nigeria say they have taken 13 people into custody after a mob attacked four students and burned them alive -- killings that were videotaped and posted online. A gruesome video on YouTube that showed the killings led to several arrests, police say. The video shows several men on the dirt, writhing in pain. Some are bloodied, and they have tires shoved over their heads. Read more: Why are Nigerians numb to slaughter? Investigators have not yet determined why the mob killed the men, said Ben Ugwuegbulam, a police spokesman in Rivers State, in southern Nigeria. The attack happened Friday. Mob justice is common in Nigeria, with some people choosing to take the law into their own hands because police are either unresponsive or unwilling to patrol high-risk areas after dark. The posting has drawn comments from some who say that police should have done more to investigate the attack before the video was posted. Read more: Gunmen attack Nigerian university
A 19-year-old prostitute working in an apartment that doubles as a brothel said she has up to eight clients a day. A woman awaits customers at a Beijing barber shop in 2008. Sex workers also ply their trade in barber shops. Working in the southern boom city of Shenzhen, a special economic zone just north of Hong Kong, she told CNN she worries about getting AIDS, but has her own prevention measures. "I always use condoms or take an injection. The medicine can prevent sexually transmitted diseases," she said. "Some girls do not use prevention measures, but we don't talk about that in public." This young woman, who would not give her name, is part of a group that Chinese and international health authorities are concerned could potentially spread HIV and AIDS in the world's most populated country, so officials have stepped up efforts to educate them about the virus and dispel misconceptions about so-called "injections" that can prevent infection. "I think sex work is probably one of the most important factors for the potential of HIV spreading in Asia and also in China. There is no doubt about it," said Bernhard Schwartlander, UNAIDS China Country Coordinator. "One of the things that we have seen in China is that knowledge about HIV/AIDS is very low in the general population and certainly also in the sex work industry. That is a big, big problem," Schwartlander said. It is estimated that some 700,000 people are living with HIV in China and there are about 50,000 new infections every year, according to the Chinese government and UNAIDS. The U.N. agency believes a significant number of those new infections include sex workers. Prostitution is officially illegal in China, but very loosely addressed by the government. It is estimated that there are between two and four million sex workers in China. As the country's economy has boomed, so has the sex industry, especially in prosperous cities like Shenzhen. Many clients flock there from Hong Kong which is just an hour away, some of them businessmen with money to spend. Condom use in China can range anywhere from about 20 percent to 80 percent, according to UNAIDS. "There are misconceptions. People think that they can avoid HIV infections by taking a pill. People think that they are not at risk for HIV infections because they don't know anybody (who has it), because you can't see it, you can't touch it. And clearly, this is something that we have to change very rapidly," Schwartlander said. Historically, HIV and AIDS have been taboo topics in China, another reason awareness can be so low. Prevention in the gay community has also been difficult because of traditional stigmas against homosexuality. But the Chinese government is now conducting educational campaigns to inform higher risk groups, including sex workers, about how to prevent the transmission of HIV. "After years of these campaigns, we found out through survey that condom use is constantly increasing, especially in urban areas, the condom use can reach 70 percent or even up to 80 percent," said Hao Yang, Deputy Bureau Chief of the Chinese Health Ministry's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau. But other areas are proving difficult. In rural parts of the country, the proportion of condom use among sex workers is less than 50 percent, Hao said. "When we go to investigate in rural areas, the proportion of people with this knowledge (of AIDS prevention) is still very low," he said. "In addition to that, the proportion of change in their activities is also very low, which means that the condom use rate is still low." About one in 200 sex workers nationwide currently has HIV, Schwartlander said. But in one part of Yunnan province in the country's far southwest, seven percent of the sex workers -- or as many as 14 in every 200 -- have HIV, according to UNAIDS. "The sex workers living in remote areas and rural areas have played an important role in AIDS spreading. We do not have a precise figure for the proportion that sex workers make up in it (the spread of AIDS), but we can say that they are making up a significant proportion," Hao said. The government has a long-term plan to educate the general public and to strengthen intervention in the high-risk populations, particularly sex workers, Hao said. When HIV initially began to spread in China, infections were concentrated among people who injected drugs, Schwartlander said. Campaigns among this group have been effective, while infections among other groups have risen. One of those groups, Hao said, was men having sex with men, which accounts for 5.9 percent of infections, according to the Chinese Health Ministry. A majority of the infections are concentrated among drug users, men having sex with men, and sex workers and their clients, Schwartlander said. "Society and communities have been able to curb the spread of HIV, also in sex work, and that is what we have to do," Schwartlander said. As China's economy grows, it is likely the sex industry will as well. Current estimates show that some 30 to 50 million people are at significant risk for HIV infection, Schwartlander said. "China is a society which is in quite a significant transition. There is a huge increase in disparity of income between the rich and the poor, and all these are very well-known factors that drive the sex industry forward," Schwartlander said. "Clearly, in China, I think that the sex industry is a rising industry. We will see an increase in the number of sex workers due to these factors in the future." A 22-year-old prostitute in Shenzhen, who did not want to give her name, said she knows the risk but needs the work. "AIDS is the number one killer for my job. I cannot let this disease destroy my life. This is only a short-term business. I don't have any relatives in Shenzhen and can't borrow any money. I can only rely on myself."
Militants carried out a deadly attack on Somalia's presidential palace Friday, officials and eyewitnesses said. An explosion at the gate was followed by an exchange of gunfire between the fighters and security guards, police officer Abdi Mohamed said. A U.N. representative said in a post on Twitter that President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told him by phone that he was unharmed. Terror network Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the attack. Somalia's national security minister, Adbikarin Hussein Guled, said at least 12 people, seven of them Al-Shabaab attackers, were killed in the attack Two government officials who died were named as the secretary to the Prime Minister and the former deputy national intelligence agency chief, Gen. Nur Shirbow. Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesman, said the group had achieved its objectives in the attack. The attack comes just over a week after a car bombing near the airport in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killed two people and wounded four more, according to police. Al-Shabaab also claimed responsibility for that attack. The group has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States. It hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state by force but has launched attacks in other countries, such as Kenya and Uganda, that have killed dozens.
but, the officials said, the list does not include adding North Korea to the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The United States will respond "proportionally" to the attack, Obama said, though he would not say how the U.S. would specifically retaliate. He did note that the U.S. has beefed up its cybersecurity infrastructure, but that "occasionally there are going to be breaches like this." An FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques a group of hackers called "Guardians of Peace" used in the Sony attack to previous North Korean cyberattacks. The North Korean-backed hackers broke into Sony's servers, published private emails and information and threatened to attack movie theaters screening "The Interview," a comedy film about an assassination plot on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton rebuffed Obama's criticism in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, saying his company did not make a mistake. Instead, Lynton said Obama, the press and the public "are mistaken as to what actually happened." Lynton pinned the decision to pull back from the planned Dec. 25 release on the major movie theater companies that told Sony they would not screen the film. "We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered, and we haven to backed down. We have always had the desire to have the American public see this movie," Lynton said. So far, no major video on demand distributors or streaming services have offered to carry "The Interview" to Americans, Lynton explained, despite a wave of suggestions that Sony distribute the film outside of movie theaters. And despite enduring what he called "the worst cyberattack in American history," Lynton said his studios would make the movie again, but may have "done some things slightly differently." Obama added that the U.S. has "no indication" that any other country was involved in the North Korean attack. Secretary of State John Kerry also sounded off on what he called a "brazen," "provocative and unprecedented" attack. "We are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this state sponsored cyber-attack," Kerry said in a statement. "These lawless acts of intimidation demonstrate North Korea's flagrant disregard for international norms." Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that the onus is on the government and the international community to act in the face of this cyberattack -- the latest in a string of attacks on major corporations in recent years that have also included J.P. Morgan Chase and Target. Stressing the "monumental size" and the "extortion" aspect of the cyberattack on Sony, Feinstein called for an "international agreement" to confront cyber threats and said the U.S. government needs to take action to better protect companies from those types of threats. "We are going for bloodshed, I believe, if we don't stop it," she said on CNN. "I would hope that we can convince the North Koreans that this carries a very heavy price." And the idea of a foreign government launching a destructive attack on an American company over an ideological matter elevated this hack to "one of the highest priority investigations we've worked on," one law enforcement official told CNN. U.S. officials also tell CNN the hackers routed the attack through servers in countries from Asia, Europe and Latin America, even some in the U.S. â€‹The hackers used common DNS masking techniques to make it look like it was coming from those places, but the National Security Agency and FBI were able to track it back to North Korea. North Korean internet traffic is routed through China, which is one way they are able to hide their activity, but the FBI was still able to trace it back to the origin, sources tell CNN. And Obama also addressed North Korea's motives, noting that attacks came after a comedic, satirical movie. "The notion that that was a threat to them I think gives you some sense of kind of what regime we're talking about," Obama said. The FBI called North Korea's actions "outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior" in a statement released Friday and called cyberthreats "one of the gravest national security dangers." The FBI did not use the words "terror" in their statement. The investigation linked the "tools" of the Sony hack to North Korean cyberattacks in March 2013 against South Korean banks and media outlets. Former Sen. Chris Dodd, the Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, released a statement Friday after the FBI announcement slamming the North Korean attacks by "cyber terrorists, bent on wreaking havoc" as a "despicable, criminal act." "This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails," Dodd said. "This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress and threaten the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who work in the film and television industry, as well as the millions who simply choose to go to the movies." Related: Cyberattacks skyrocket Bruce Bennett, a North Korean expert at the RAND Corporation told CNN that he consulted informally on the field as a favor to Lynton, who sits on the RAND Board of Trustees. "He asked RAND's president if he had a Korean expert to speak to in order to help sort out how to handle the picture and RAND's president asked me to do that. We had a couple of brief conversations, viewed the movie and sent some comments," he said, adding "this was not a paid consultency." Bennett said he suggested Sony let the State Department know about the film and the potential political issues involved and offered to call Robert King, the State Department's envoy for North Korean human rights. He said "I simply notified him of what was going on." King told Bennett the film "was an American business decision and the State Department doesn't get involved in things like that." Bennett said he did not show King or anyone at the State Department the film and said he was skeptical that anyone at the State Department saw it. Referring to the State Department, Bennett said "their attitude was that they were glad to know about it, but it was not their role to intercede." In addition to King's discussion with Bennett, the State Department has acknowledged that Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs Danny Russell spoke with Lynton about the film, but denied he had any involvement in its script or creative direction. State Department spokeswoman said she did not know of anyone at State that screened the movie, though it is not clear still if State officials knew how the movie ended. "I did not come across anyone who saw the movie in advance," Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in an interview Thursday on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper. Sen. John McCain on Friday said the cyberattack amounted to "an act of war" on Friday and said the U.S. should retaliate in kind with cyberwarfare. "This is the greatest blow to free speech that I've seen in my lifetime probably," McCain said Friday on Arizona radio station KFYI 550's "The Mike Broomhead Show." "We have to respond in kind. We have lots of capability in cyber and we ought to start cranking that up." McCain plans to hold a cybersecurity hearing into the Sony hack in the first two weeks of the next Congress, when he takes over as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
The polite hush that descends on the crowd seconds before service is nowhere to be heard when it comes to the issue of equal prize money in women's tennis. Australian Open champion Serena Williams pocketed $1.3 million for the tournament, the same as male winner Rafael Nadal. It may be two years since Wimbledon and the French Open joined the other major tournaments in offering women the same cash prize as men, but for some tennis fans the issue is far from resolved. "Admit it sisters," screamed one recent headline on Australian Web site AdelaideNow, "this is not equal." The author went on: "Political correctness, sexual equality and feminism all prevent many commentators from stating the bleeding obvious ... no sports watcher in their right minds could honestly say female tennis players, or golfers for that matter, deserve as much money as their male counterparts." The writer -- a woman -- went on to lambaste the world's best female tennis players, describing world number one Serena Williams' defeat of Dinara Safina in the Australian Open final as "embarrassing, pitiful and pathetic." "Her humiliation of Dinara Safina was a terrible advertisement for a sport that has apparently disappeared up its own backside." Rather than provoking a tirade of abuse, many readers agreed with the author, outspoken Australian journalist and sports commentator, Rebecca Wilson. "Right on the money. Women's tennis is boring. Typical game. "Ugh. Grunt. Ugh. Grunt. Ugh. Grunt. Out. Love-Fifteen," one said. Another added: "It's about time someone said what everyone was thinking." More chimed in: "Everyone agrees, few will say it" and "totally agree. Women's tennis is pathetic." A couple of dissenters in the crowd urged Wilson to turn her attentions elsewhere: "The usual tripe that Wilson dishes up week after week," and "please go away and let someone with something important to say use your space." What do you think? Do women deserve equal prize money in tennis? Sound Off below. Billie Jean King has heard it all before. The former world number one has spent a good part of the last forty years campaigning for equal prize money, and equal status, for women. The decision by the All England Tennis and Croquet Club in February 2007, and then the French Open one day later, to award equal prize money to women marked the end of a fight that started in 1968, the first year of Open tennis. "When Rod Laver won Wimbledon, he got £2,000. And when I won Wimbledon in the same year, 1968, I got £750," she told CNN in an interview filmed for this month's edition of "Revealed." "I knew then that was going to be one of our next battles that we would have to fight over the years," she added. King hoped to put the matter to rest in 1973 when she took on self-proclaimed male chauvinist Bobby Riggs in now famous match known as "The Battle of the Sexes." Riggs, a former men's number one, claimed the women's game was so poor that even he, as a 55-year-old retiree from the sport, could beat the top female players. King accepted the challenge and thrashed Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 in front of a television audience of millions. Those who argue for lower pay for women's tennis say they play fewer sets and attract a smaller television audience so they should receive less money. Campaigners for equal pay say that it's not an issue of time on the court, but an matter of fair and equal treatment As current world number six Venus Williams once argued in an open letter published in The Times, "we enjoy huge and equal celebrity and are paid for the value we deliver to broadcasters and spectators, not the amount of time we spend on the stage." What do you think? Should the top female tennis players be taking home the same prize money as men? Sound Off below.

Think of the Arab souk -- the fabled marketplaces of the Middle East -- and it immediately conjures up images straight from the Arabian Nights: mountains of yellow turmeric, shafts of light through lattices and the air thick with incense smoke. These powerful associations have not been lost on the team from the United Arab Emirates that last month won the bid to host the World Expo 2020; exhibitors making the journey to Dubai in seven years will be setting up their pavilions in the biggest souk in history. The 438-hectare site at the Dubai Trade Center, Jebel Ali, will be one of the largest ever developed for a World Expo. Created in an empty desert area between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the vast zones of the structure -- each one representing the bid themes of sustainability, mobility and opportunity - are inspired by the labyrinthine galleries of the souk. At the core of the site will be an open plaza called Al Wasl --Arabic for "the connection" -- to fit with the Expo theme of "Connecting Minds, Creating the Future." Certainly in terms of Expo history, Dubai has a tough act to follow. Previous Expos have famously given the world the Eiffel Tower and unveiled products as important as the telephone and as ubiquitous as Heinz Tomato Ketchup For Greg Lindsay, co-author of "Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next", the Expo proximity to the new Al-Maktoum International Airport and Dubai World Central development is especially significant. "(Dubai World Central) is the best organic example of an 'aerotropolis,'" says Lindsay, whose book puts the case that modern globalized cities such as Dubai are built around, and feed off, airports in much the same way as cities in the 19th century were built around the railways. "In 1990, there was nothing really there ... it was the strategy of Emirates and the civil aviation authority to make Dubai the crossroads of the world. "I do think winning the Expo will be a huge catalyst for its development," he said. Hub for a new Silk Road What can be said of Dubai World Central also holds for much of Dubai too. A generation ago, it was just a modest regional entrepot. Today its strategic position between East and West has made it one of the world's key hubs in the globalized economy. According to Afshin Molavi, a global geo-economics specialist and senior advisor at Oxford Analytica, Chinese businesses use Dubai as a hub for Africa, Indian traders use the city to access markets across the world and Western multinationals see Dubai as a hub for the Middle East. "Dubai sits at the intersection of one of the most transformative moments in geo-economic history in more than a century: the gradual but inexorable shift of the economic center of gravity from the West to emerging markets and the rise of the so-called "South-South" trade," Molavi said. "I would argue that Dubai and the UAE stand at the center of 'The New Silk Road' of trade between the Middle East and Asia, and also what HSBC calls 'The Southern Silk Road' linking Latin America, Africa, and Asia in a new world of trade."

In terms of air traffic alone, Dubai 's importance as a hub cannot be underestimated. Just four hours' flight from key cities in both Europe and Asia, there are now more flights from India to Dubai than anywhere else in the world and, in the other directions, more than 300 flights weekly from Dubai to India. Inflating property bubbles? Despite its position at the center of a region undergoing massive change, the successful Expo bid has raised concerns that Dubai may become a victim of its own success. Regional instability combined with rapid development has led to one of the world's most volatile property markets. Already a magnet for the super-rich, real estate prices are now underpinned by Syrian, Libyan and Egyptian investors sitting out political troubles at home. According to property analysts, prices have already surged 20% since last year and rents in some neighborhoods are up by 40%. Read more: Oxford, Yale or Abu Dhabi? Dubai estimates its successful Expo 2020 bid will generate US$23 billion, or 24% of the city's GDP, between 2015 and 2021. With memories still fresh of the bust in 2008 when property prices were slashed by 50% and Dubai had to be bailed out by Abu Dhabi to the tune of US$10 billion, some fear that another massive correction is on the way. Faris Mansour, director of Mubadala Pramerica Real Estate Investors, told the Cityscape Global conference in Dubai recently that the city should brace for another fall. "The (investment) capital is temporary and can quickly move out," Mansour warned. "And that's not to say it will fall necessarily as it did before. But it will fall, it will correct and this is something we should all expect to happen and I expect it to happen in the next 18 to 24 months... as capital becomes more expensive globally." Despite the dire warning, many believe the Expo -- far from creating a bubble - will underpin property prices for many years to come in a city that recovered from the crisis in 2008 faster than anyone expected. For Molavi, Dubai's real economic resource lies in its people and its position at the crossroads of the world. "Dubai might be one of the most hyper-connected places on the planet," he said. "You can see it on the streets and in the malls. There are not many places where you can mingle with more than 200 different nationalities."
Passengers aboard US Airways Flight 2846 were waiting on the tarmac at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport when their pilot came on the intercom. "We've been notified about a health emergency aboard the aircraft," passenger Dean Davidson heard. A few minutes later, Davidson saw a flight attendant walk toward another passenger sitting a few rows ahead of him. The flight attendant handed the slender middle-aged man a medical mask. Emergency personnel boarded the plane a short time later and removed the man, Davidson said. A firefighter then came on the intercom and announced that the passenger had active tuberculosis and was contagious and that other passengers on the flight had been exposed. He advised them to contact their physicians immediately, Davidson said. Arizona health officials are not recommending passengers on the plane seek medical care because their risk of being infected with tuberculosis is "very, very low," said Dr. Rebecca Sunshine, disease control director for Maricopa County Public Health. "To put this in perspective... We're much more concerned that the passengers on this flight contracted influenza than that they contracted TB," she said. The US Airways flight took off from Austin, Texas, on Friday, according to airline spokesman Bill McGlashen. It landed in Phoenix approximately two hours later on a layover before it was scheduled to fly to Los Angeles. There was no warning or flag on the passenger's record when he was going through security or when he boarded the plane, McGlashen said. After the plane took off, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the Transportation Security Administration of a possible risk. The TSA then notified US Airways, McGlashen said. The passenger in question has not been confirmed to have an infectious disease, CDC spokeswoman Karen Hunter said Sunday. "And even if a passenger had infectious TB, the duration of the flight was so short that there would likely be no risk of exposure to other passengers." Another spokesperson for the CDC said Monday the government organization is still waiting on test results for the passenger, a U.S. citizen who was traveling internationally. Fast facts about tuberculosis Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which mainly affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain. There are two types of TB: latent TB infection, which is not contagious, and TB disease, which is contagious. A person infected with latent TB shows no sign of symptoms and may not feel sick. Someone with TB disease usually feels ill; they may be coughing up blood and may have a fever, night sweats and/or chest pain. TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes or speaks. Germs can stay in the air for hours, but the risk in this case was very small, said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. "The risk is greatest for people sitting two rows ahead of and two rows behind the individuals," Schaffner said. "We don't have to worry about the blankets and seat rests and the like. It's how the air is transmitted and handled in the plane." Schaffner said passengers on the plane should have a TB skin test done by their local health care provider. People who contract TB must take several medications for six to nine months to combat the infection, according to the CDC. Some varieties of the TB bacterium have developed a resistance to common antibiotics and may be more difficult to treat. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, are particularly susceptible to the disease. The number of TB cases in the United States has been declining since 1992, according to the CDC. In 2010, the most recent CDC data available, there were 569 deaths from TB. Davidson was flying home from Austin, where he had been visiting his daughter for Thanksgiving. He said other passengers told him the potentially infected man appeared "awkward" before and during the flight, continually rubbing his face. Davidson plans to get in touch with his doctor Monday morning. He said he has not heard from US Airways about the incident. In January 2010, a person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew from Philadelphia to San Francisco on US Airways despite being on the CDC's "Do Not Board" list, which is different from the TSA's "No Fly" list. The Do Not Board list was created in 2007 after Atlanta lawyer Andrew Speaker traveled abroad with a drug-resistant case of tuberculosis, setting off an international health scare. Speaker insisted that he had not been told he was contagious; public health officials disagreed. The CDC manages the Do Not Board list in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. The list is authorized under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, according to the CDC. Local and state health officials can contact the CDC to request that someone be placed on the list. "To include someone on the list, CDC must determine that the person 1) likely is contagious with a communicable disease that would constitute a serious public health threat should the person be permitted to board a flight; 2) is unaware of or likely to be nonadherent with public health recommendations, including treatment; and 3) likely will attempt to board a commercial aircraft," the CDC website states. "Once a person is placed on the list, airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass to the person for any commercial domestic flight or for any commercial international flight arriving in or departing from the United States." The Do Not Board list does not apply to other methods of transportation. The CDC reviews the records of every person on the list every two weeks to see whether they are eligible to fly again. In general, airline passengers are not legally obligated to tell an airline when they are sick, said Jeff Ment, an attorney who specializes in travel law. Unlike cruise lines, which require you to disclose illnesses leading up to the cruise, he said, airlines do not include any language in the ticket purchasing process that would prevent you from traveling. "If you have some disease and its contagious, where's the threshold?" he asked. "If you have the flu? If you have a really bad cold? I think that once you establish some rule that there has to be notification, it becomes a slippery slope." As a "common carrier," Ment said, airlines are legally required to do as much as possible to ensure the safety of their passengers. If a passenger appears too ill to survive the flight without medical assistance, an airline could prevent him from flying, he said. Or if the airline knew that a passenger had a contagious disease, employees could require her to wear a mask during the flight to prevent germs from spreading. In this kind of situation, any legal troubles would more likely stem from a civil lawsuit. After the 2007 incident, Speaker was sued by eight of his fellow passengers in a Canadian court. Ment said plaintiffs would have to show that the infected passenger knew that he had the disease and was extremely careless around his fellow travelers. "The line is crossed when the person knows they're sick and intentionally tries to do something (to infect others) or acts with callous disregard for your well-being," Ment said.
Pirates hijacked three ships off the coast of Somalia on Thursday in the "worst number of attacks" in one day in many years, an international maritime watchdog said. An image of the Burum Ocean -- a suspected pirate mother  ship in the Gulf of Aden. "Four attacks in two days, ships being hijacked and crews being taken, and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable," said Capt. Pottengal Mukudan of the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crime. Pirates fired at a ship sailing under an Iranian flag and boarded it about 5:20 a.m. local time Thursday (10:20 p.m. ET Wednesday), said Noel Chong, head of the International Chamber of Commerce's Piracy Reporting Centre, a multinational coalition naval task force that monitors the region They hijacked a ship operating under a Japanese flag a few minutes later, he said. A German ship was hijacked about 8 a.m. local time, Mukudan said. He said the pirates are still on board the German vessel, but he had few details. Pirate attacks are frequent in the waters off Somalia, a notoriously unsafe area for unescorted vessels. Canada announced this month that it was dispatching a warship to the area to protect U.N. aid ships after more than two dozen reported pirate attacks in the region this year. "This is the worst number of attacks that we have seen in a short period of time for years," Mukudan said, calling on CTF-150 to "give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control. There have been seven vessels [hijacked] since the 20th of July." Thursday's spate of attacks in the Gulf of Aden came two days after pirates boarded a Malaysian tanker off the coast of Somalia. They continue to hold it, Chong said. The IMB monitors shipping crime and reported Thursday's incidents to CTF-150, which is based in Djibouti, and the task force is "monitoring the situation," Mukudan said. "They have some of their vessels ,which are tracking some of these hijacked ships, but the problem is it's very difficult to take action once the hijackers are on board," he said. "The lives of the hostages is at risk." He said he understood that the task force was busy with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but noted that the IMB would like to see the task force do more to respond to the problem before the hijackings occur. The IMB said in April that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008, compared with 41 for the same period last year. It recorded 263 pirates attacks last year, up from 239 the year before and the first increase in three years. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report
129 science students and 105 art students. He said in a written statement that the confusion resulted because the art students didn't leave campus as expected on the day of the attack. The head of the dormitory initially didn't count them among the missing. No one knows where the missing girls are. And even more surprising, no one's particularly shocked. "All the community are sympathizing with the parents," Kwambura told CNN earlier. But, she said, "the people in the villages are not surprised." Such is life in the lawless Borno province. Tucked away near the border with Cameroon, with phone services cut off and travel strongly discouraged, this poor corner of Nigeria is no stranger to such brazen, violent acts. For 11 months, the provinces of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa have been under a state of emergency due to relentless assaults blamed on Boko Haram. The Islamist militant group has bombed churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders. Boko Haram -- whose name means "Western education is sin" in the local Hausa language -- says it wants to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation. The group has gone about its misguided mission with such depressing regularity that residents have become somewhat numb. Where's the president? Nigerians marvel that U.S. President Barack Obama traveled to Massachusetts after the Boston Marathon bombings  that killed three people last year. Boko Haram-related violence killed 1,500 in the first three months of this year alone. And yet, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has not visited the region recently. Part of it may have to do with geographic divisions. Jonathan is from the predominantly Christian south. That's not just geographically distant but also culturally different from the Muslim-dominated, violence-wracked north. To put things in perspective, none of Jonathan's major political rivals from the north attended his inauguration in 2011. And widespread violence broke out in the north when his presidential win was announced, with some residents claiming the election was rigged. It's the opposite of what happened with Jonathan's predecessor. The previous president, Umaru Yar'Adua, was from the north. During his tenure, violence ravaged the country's oil-rich, southern Niger Delta, with militant groups saying they wanted a fairer distribution of the region's oil wealth. Where's the military? The Nigerian military has been engaged in a brutal, ever-escalating fight with Boko Haram. Rights group accuse both sides of ruthlessness -- Boko Haram of indiscriminate attacks, and the military of extrajudicial killings. But when it comes to the abductions of girls -- and there have been many -- the military has had a difficult time. Last week, the defense ministry erroneously reported that all but eight of the girls from the latest kidnapping were free. It retracted a day later. Lawan Zanna, the father of one of the students, said the government turned from using "blatant propaganda" to making a "blatant lie." Part of the reason the military is loath to respond mightily may be because the girls who are kidnapped are raped, forced into servitude -- but rarely killed. In February, 29 college students in the northern Yobe province were killed after an attack authorities blamed on Boko Haram. All of them were males. The women were spared. In other instances, kidnapped girls were later rescued while working on farms. Many were pregnant or had babies -- the result of rape. The spate of kidnappings began in May 2013 when Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau announced in a video that this was part of its latest bloody campaign. The kidnappings, he said, were retaliation for Nigerian security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members. Those kidnapped, he said, would begin a new life as a "servant." But the latest incident has ratcheted up the pressure on the military. The military said "ongoing, frantic efforts" of security forces, vigilante groups and hunters are attempting to find and free the students. But a week later, the fate of 190 girls remain unknown.
The world's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment, the World Wildlife Fund said Friday. These two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in Australia. The WWF's latest Living Planet Index shows terrestrial, freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005, with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop. The index is included in a report called "2010 and Beyond: Rising to the Biodiversity Challenge," which the WWF prepared for an international biodiversity conference in Germany later this month. "No one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines, greater vulnerability to natural disasters, and greater effects from global warming," said James Leape, director-general of WWF International. The Living Planet Index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species, which the WWF says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends. Terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period, the WWF said. Marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period, with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005, the WWF said. "Many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence, and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched," the WWF report said. Freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003. The WWF said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet, inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species. In tropical regions, freshwater species were especially hard-hit; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000. The WWF said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003. The causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere, such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems, the WWF said. The dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species' capacity to replace itself, the WWF said. Overfishing is one example. Overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species, according to the report, which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals. Overharvesting of timber is also a major factor, it said. Invasive species, whether introduced deliberately or not, are another threat, especially in freshwater ecosystems, where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species, the WWF said. Pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity, it said. The WWF called on governments attending this month's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010. It wants governments to establish protected areas, particularly those areas important for food security, water supply, medicine, and disaster mitigation, and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020.
A handful of people rallied outside the Japanese Embassy on Saturday to show support for an American man who is jailed in Japan, accused of trying to kidnap his own children. Amy Savoie calls on Japan to release her husband during a rally outside the Japanese Embassy in Washington. During the demonstration, Christopher Savoie's wife, Amy, along with others from the Children's Rights Council of Japan -- a group that advocates visitation for both parents in divorce cases, and which organized Saturday's event -- called for Savoie's release. "It makes me feel wonderful to know that these people are calling him a hero, saying he's brave, and I just hope he can come home and say thank you to all these people who've supported him," Amy Savoie told CNN. Christopher Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school Monday in a rural town in southern Japan, police in Japan said. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try to obtain passports for them, screaming at guards to let him in the compound. Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when Japanese police arrested him. Amy Savoie said the separation is taking a toll on her. "I just wish I could talk to him, but I am forced to live with the fact that I can't talk to him. So I have to soothe myself and comfort myself with what he would say right now, and I just hope he's doing well," she said. Christopher Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their divorce in January. The couple, both citizens of the United States and Japan, had lived in Japan but moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. During the summer, she fled with the children to Japan, according to court documents. A U.S. court than granted Christopher Savoie sole custody. Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian. The law there also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When the couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple still are considered married in Japan because they never divorced there, police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement. If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent, Japanese law considers the person who took the child an abductor. Christopher Savoie will be jailed for at least 10 days while Japanese prosecutors sort out details of the case.
One Goh, the 43-year-old Korean-American man suspected in the execution-style shooting deaths at a small Christian college in California, seemed a doting son visiting his parents in senior housing. But at the same time, he was capable of displaying unbridled anger at the school, according to police and others who had contact with him. The portrait of Goh emerging one day after six women and one man were shot to death at Oikos University in Oakland is of someone who felt he was "teased" and "picked on" at the college, which eventually expelled him, possibly for poor behavior, police said. Goh was self-conscious of his inability to speak English like a native and felt that students and others at the school made fun of him, police said. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan said it wasn't immediately clear why Goh had been expelled from the college but, "We've been told that some of the possibilities are that he was expelled for his behavioral problems, anger management, but nothing specific." While Goh appeared close to his family, he struggled personally with significant debt, including a tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service, according to court records. His brother, a soldier, reportedly was killed last year in the line of duty. CNN affiliate KGO said the brother, a staff sergeant in the Army, died in a car accident while training with the Special Forces. After the shooting, which just lasted minutes, the gunman drove off in a victim's car, and when the suspect surrendered to police at a grocery story in the Oakland suburb of Alameda, the gunman showed no remorse and told police he was angry about his expulsion from the college, police said. No charges have been filed yet in the mass killing as police continue their investigation, authorities said. Goh was being held Tuesday in Alameda County's Santa Rita Jail pending an initial appearance in court this week. The early, broad impressions of Goh have drawn the attention of civic and church leaders in the city's Korean-American community, who were scheduled to attend a memorial service in Oakland Tuesday evening. Community leaders will work together to help those living in the area and those affected directly cope with the tragedy, said June Lee, executive director of Korean Community of the East Bay, based in Oakland. Oikos University, located in a one-story structure that resembles a converted office building, caters to the Korean-American Christian community but also has students from diverse backgrounds. It offers degrees in theology, music, nursing and Asian medicine, according to its website. "First of all, we would not want to localize this story too much," Lee told CNN. "We think that Koreans or Asians are mainstreamed. We're not so much different from others. It is a tragedy and we recognize that. We're looking for a way to help the families and the community that are impacted by this incident." Community and faith leaders have yet to determine what issues need to be raised in the aftermath of the mass shooting, she said. "We need to identify the issues first. All the community leaders are willing to convene and to have a collective strategy in the community," Lee said. Meanwhile, Police Chief Jordan said that Goh, after he surrendered, didn't appear "to be remorseful at all." CNN's Ashley Hayes and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.
Scores of insurgents have been killed over the last day during fighting in southern Afghanistan, the U.S.-led coalition said on Wednesday. U.S. soldiers pass by Afghan policemen as they stand guard at a checkpoint near the partly-ruined Darlaman Palace in Kabul. Afghan and coalition troops have killed an estimated 104 insurgents in ongoing fighting since Tuesday morning near the Musa Qalah Wadi in Helmand province, the coalition said. A coalition service member was killed and four others were wounded in the fighting between troops and Taliban militants. In neighboring Uruzgan province, a battle between Taliban militants and troops Tuesday left more than 65 insurgents dead in a six-hour battle. The Afghan-coalition patrol had been near the same spot, northeast of Deh Rawod, where more than three dozen insurgents preparing an ambush were killed last week. "As with our forces near Musa Qalah, this operation is intended to deny the enemies of peace the use of Deh Rawod as a safe haven," said Army Maj. Chris Belcher, a Combined Joint Task Force-82 spokesman. "Much like last week's engagement, last night's overwhelming victory by ANSF against the extremists is one more example of this strategy to secure a stable and safe living area for the residents of  province." There might have been injuries to three non-combatants. There were no reports of troop casualties. E-mail to a friend
Teachers in Tacoma, Washington, have voted to continue their strike, in defiance of a a court order to stop. Rich Wood, the spokesman for the Tacoma teachers union, said teachers voted Thursday to continue their strike despite a judge's Wednesday order. At a union meeting Thursday afternoon, 1,478 teachers voted to keep striking, Wood said, adding that 107 voted "no" or abstained.  He said teachers were concerned about how Judge Bryan Chushcoff would react to their defying his order. The Tacoma School District did not return a call seeking comment, but a message posted on the district's website said school for 28,000 students would be suspended again Friday, as it has been for the rest of the week. Chushcoff's order on Wednesday was in a case the district brought against the striking teachers and their union. After the ruling, District Superintendent Art Jarvis said he expected teachers to return to work while the union and school district continued stalled contract negotiations. At the time of the ruling, a hearing was scheduled for Friday to ensure the union complied with the judge's order. Chushcoff also ordered hearings on the legality of the strike and stalled negotiations. Attorneys for the school district argued that since teachers are state employees they do not have the right to strike. "The illegal strike has forced the district to close 57 schools, disrupting the lives of approximately 30,000 students and their families," school district attorney Shannon McMinimee wrote in the lawsuit. McMinimee argued that if the strike continued indefinitely the protest would harm students, particularly children with disabilities, low-income pupils who rely on meals provided at schools and seniors applying to college next year. "Students in Tacoma, under the Constitution, are entitled to an education," she said. Some 1,900 teachers went on strike this week after talks broke down over a new contract for educators. The teachers union argued the school district was unyielding on the issues of class size, teacher pay and how teachers are transferred between schools. Tyler Firkins, the attorney for the teachers union, said the school district was not negotiating in good faith and that if the strike continued, students could make up the missed time later. "What they are saying is that the school year is immovable, can't be changed under any circumstances. That is not correct," Firkins said. "Whether my child misses a week or two, it's not going to affect her education," Firkins said of his daughter, who he said attends classes at a Tacoma public school. "This is about teaching our kids to stand up to bullies," said Andy Coons, president of the teachers union.  "I'm disappointed that we're not bargaining, that we're spending the day in court." The state judge said the school district's arguments that students were being harmed by the strike were enough reason to halt the protests, at least until more hearings and negotiations could be held. Calling himself "a product of the Tacoma school district," Chushcoff said if anyone didn't like his ruling, they could blame it on his education. During Wednesday's court session, Chushcoff held up photographs of a sign he said had been placed at his home. The printed sign said "Support Tacoma teachers." "It's not appropriate to try and influence or intimidate me," he said.
In a bid to end rampant poaching, Kenya is implanting microchips in every rhino nationwide, an extensive process that will include sedating hundreds of animals. Decimated by illegal killings, the endangered rhino is increasingly under attack by poachers using high-tech, sophisticated technology. The microchips will allow wildlife officials to track the animals and trace poached horns. "It's a costly and time-consuming process to get the chips on the rhinos," said Robert Magori, the World Wildlife Fund communications director for eastern and southern Africa. "The rhinos have to be tracked, identified, sedated, fitted with two chips each (on the horn and on the animal), revived and finally released." Kenya has 631 black rhinos and a total population of 1,030 rhinos, he said. The animals are part of the big five that draw tourists, a major source of revenue for the east African nation. The other four are the lion, elephant, leopard and buffalo. More money, more problems Poaching of the rhino horn is a lucrative industry, with much of the loot sold to the affluent in Asia, particularly China and Vietnam. In those countries, some believe the horns can cure a series of ills, including cancer and hangovers, and can boost virility. A kilogram fetches about $20,000, according to a report by Moses Montesh, a criminology professor at the University of South Africa. A single horn weighs about 10 kilograms (22 pounds). In Kenya, each rhino will get two microchips -- one in the horn and another one in an unidentified part of the animal. The microchip is less than 2 inches long and can barely be traced by poachers, Magori said. The fitting process is expected to take up to four months. "With poachers getting more sophisticated in their approach, it is vital that conservation efforts embrace the use of more sophisticated technology to counter the killing of wildlife," WWF Kenya said in a statement. Struggling to keep up Organized crime syndicates are using military-grade helicopters, night-vision equipment and guns fitted with silencers, taking rhino poaching to a whole new level and leaving conservationists struggling to keep up. Nations such as South Africa and Kenya have invested in unmanned drones, sniffer dogs and increased security, but have failed to halt the rising tide of rhino slaughter. In addition to the microchips, the organization will use forensic DNA technology to identify the animals. "This will serve to strengthen rhino monitoring, protect the animals on site and also support anti-trafficking mechanisms nationally and regionally," WWF Kenya said. Evidence of poaching Once the systems are set up, every rhino nationwide will be traceable, providing investigators with evidence in cases of poaching and making it easier to prosecute suspects. Rhino poaching soared by 43% between 2011 and 2012, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a worldwide network. Last year alone, about 745 rhinos were poached throughout Africa -- the highest number in two decades. Of those, a record 668 rhinos were killed in South Africa alone. In South Africa, officials are dyeing rhino horns pink and tingeing them with nonlethal chemicals to discourage consumers from buying them. CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report.
Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkey's treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide. A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the "genocide" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. "I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here," said Hoyer of Maryland. "I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is." Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. "More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future," they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at "a broad range of options" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. "We're confident that we'll find ways to do that," Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. "There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have." Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. "About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey," Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs.  See Incirlik's key location » The U.S. military issued a "warning order" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

What happens when you give thousand of cans of food to really creative people? How about a "canned" tornado or an "uncanny" sculpture of an apple being eaten by ants. Swarms of people are being delighted by the construction work in New York's World Financial Center during the city's  18th Annual CANstruction Competition. On display are 25 sculptures created from more than 100,000 cans of food -- designed and built by architects and engineers. Mia Tsiamis, a structural engineer from the firm ARUP, has been her team's captain for five years. Their entry "Cangsta's Paradise" took three months to design and 10 hours to build. "The whole process is a lesson in project management. It's certainly a challenge squeezing it in with the rest of our daily work," said Tsiamis. New York is one of about 100 cities around the world taking part in the international charity competition known as CANstruction that is aimed at helping the hungry. Rules allow each team five people to work on their entry. The cans cannot be bound with glue or adhesives and designers are not allowed to color the cans -- so there is endless time donated to finding the tuna or bean cans with the properly colored labels for the particular design. Among the entries were an enormous Mr. Potato Head, the original Battleship board game, King Kong, Russian Babushka dolls and the Metropolitan Transit Authority designed a train. "With some of the sculptures, you have to stand way back to see what has been created," said Daniel Garwood, a volunteer with American Institute of Architects, one of the presenters of the competition. A representation of Mario and Luigi of the "Mario Brothers" video games is one of those objects better seen from afar. Children were especially excited to see the exhibits, snapping pictures and staring in awe. Second- and third-graders of The Mustard Seed School in Hoboken, New Jersey, visited the site on a field trip. "This year we are teaching them about buildings, foundations and service projects so this is the perfect combination!" said art teacher Lynn Hamill. The youngsters were running around the larger-than-life canned art feverishly trying to complete an assignment. Jennifer Groce, a parent chaperone for the school, was trying to focus the kids'  excitement. "They have to sketch the different projects and write down how many cans each structure is made of and how many New Yorkers will it feed," Groce said. The children picked favorites but  their top choices changed each time they saw the next structure down the line. "I love Mario," one student said. "Oh and this one too!" He was pointing at another one. Celebrity chef and cookbook author Rocco Dispirito and host of Bravo's TV show "Top Chef: Just Desserts" Gail Simmons are among this year's judges who selected the winning sculptures. CANstruction is designed to raise hunger awareness during the Thanksgiving season. All of the cans used in the contest will be donated to City Harvest for distribution to programs that feed impoverished New Yorkers. Co-Presented by the American Institute of Architects, the Society for Design Administration and Arts World Financial Center, Canstruction is on display until November 22.
Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar was again denied the chance to secure a record 100th international century on Friday as Australia won the second Test in Sydney by an innings and 68 runs to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Tendulkar is international cricket's record run scorer in both the five-day and limited overs formats but has been stranded on 99 centuries since March last year. The 38-year-old batsman made 73 in the first innings of India's 122-run defeat in Melbourne, and this time the "Little Master" fell for 80 after being caught by Michael Hussey off the part-time bowling of Australia captain Michael Clarke. Having started the penultimate day on 112-4, 354 runs behind Australia's 659-4 declared, the tourists were dismissed for 400 to end any hopes of a first series win on the continent. Clarke's triple ton squeezes India It was another frustrating dismissal for Tendulkar, who fell agonizingly short against the West Indies in his home city Mumbai in November when he was out for 94. His last century came against South Africa at the 50-over World Cup when he reached 111. Tendulkar's wicket was all the more sweet for man of the match Clarke, whose unbeaten 329 with the bat put Australia in control of the match. "It's a very nice wicket to have, that's for sure," Clarke told reporters. "To be able to get such a great player out is a very handy wicket, so I was stoked with that. "Sachin's been such a great player for so long, everyone goes through that period. It's nice that he's not made his 100th hundred in this series, but there's a long way to go. Never write off great players. As a team we have the greatest respect for him." Resuming on eight, Tendulkar quickly reached 50 off 89 balls -- including seven fours -- and went to the lunch break on 70, before being caught at slip from Clarke's gentle left-arm off-spin. Opening batsman Gautam Gambhir earlier fell for 83, while VVS Laxman added 103 with Tendulkar before becoming the fifth man to depart for 66. Laxman and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (2) both went to fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus, who completed a five-wicket haul when he dismissed Ravi Ashwin for 62 to end the innings. "We have lost the chance of winning the series, but with two more Test matches to go we can level the series so that's what we're looking to do," said Dhoni, whose team made a disappointing 191 in the first innings. "It is a bit of a worry but the good thing is in the second innings we saw the batsmen score runs. What we have seen in the last couple of Test matches is everybody has scored at least a 50 which gives us an indication that we need to convert those fifties into big innings and put runs on the board." Hilfenhaus ended the Sydney match with figures of 8-157, but Australia's celebrations were tempered by the news that promising young fast bowler James Pattinson will miss the final two clashes of the series due to a foot injury. The 21-year-old played a major role in Australia's victory, taking four wickets in the first innings and one in the second, and has an impressive haul of 25 wickets in his first four Test matches. Meanwhile, South Africa clinched a long-awaited 2-1 series victory at home to Sri Lanka after winning the third Test in Cape Town by 10 wickets on Friday. The tourists reached 342 in their second innings after a battling 115 not out by Thilan Samaraweera, which meant the Proteas needed just two runs for victory. Sri Lanka resumed on day four at 138-4 with Samaraweera on 19, and raised hopes of setting a decent target as he took his partnership with Angelo Mathews to 142. But Vernon Philander trapped all-rounder Mathews leg before wicket for 63, and the fast bowler then claimed his third wicket as young wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal went for one. Spinner Imran Tahir and all-rounder Jaques Kallis mopped up the tail to also finish with three wickets each as South Africa won a series at home for the first time since 2008.
In a move likely to further strain relations between the United States and Israel, the municipality of Jerusalem has given final approval for a controversial Israeli housing project in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Approval of the project paves the way for construction of 20 apartments being developed by American millionaire Irving Moskowitz on land that he purchased in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Moskowitz, an avid supporter of Jewish building in East Jerusalem, purchased the land in 1985. To make way for the new housing units the historic Shepherd Hotel which was built in the 1930s by a prominent Palestinian family would be torn down. The Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem has become an area highly coveted by Jewish nationalists wishing to cement Jewish claims to the land, and it has become a fault line in the public debate about Israeli building in Arab areas of East Jerusalem. Every week hundreds of Palestinians, Israelis, and international activists stage protests in the neighborhood to protest Israeli government building policies. East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan in the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Israel claims sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, though this it is a claim not recognized by the international community. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capitol of their future state. In a terse statement Wednesday, the Jerusalem Municipality argued the East Jerusalem construction was actually approved in July 2009 and that the owners of the land merely paid a necessary fee last week which generated an automatic approval for the project to proceed. "This is distorted media information in order to create a provocation during the Prime Minister's visit to the United States" read the statement. The building plan, which was given municipal approval last summer, was met with great disapproval from the United States which demanded that it be stopped. It was a demand, then as now, that fell on deaf ears. At the time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet, "Our sovereignty over [Jerusalem] cannot be challenged. This means that residents of Jerusalem may purchase apartments in all parts of the city. We cannot accept the idea that Jews will not have the right to live and purchase in all parts of Jerusalem." Netanyahu echoed the same arguments in defense of the Israeli announcement two weeks ago to build 1,600 units of housing in a different East Jerusalem neighborhood. That announcement, made while U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden was visiting Israel, set off a diplomatic rift between the United States and Israel that both sides are still attempting to iron out. U.S. President Barack Obama and Netanyahu met Wednesday evening in Washington to discuss Israel's plans for new housing units in East Jerusalem. The leaders did not appear before cameras, and there was no sign of an end to the dispute. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, called the approval "an intentional insult to the U.S. administration" and works against "any serious indirect or direct negotiations" between Israel and the Palestinians. Rudeineh said the Obama administration "should put enough pressure on Israel to implement what has been written and issued by the Quartet in Moscow several days ago." On Friday, the Middle East Quartet, the United States, European Union, the United Nations, and Russia, called on both sides "to refrain from proactive actions" and for Israel to freeze all settlement activity in an effort to promote peace talks.
The evolution of Tamerlan Tsarnaev from aspiring Olympic boxer to apparent radical jihadist may have been influenced by a friend in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "This person just took his brain. He just brainwashed him completely," Tsarnaev's uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, told CNN from his home in Maryland, describing the friend as an Armenian convert to Islam. While Tsarni did not give the friend's name, The Associated Press reported that other members of Tsarnaev's family said the friend goes by the name "Misha." Asked about those reports, Elmirza Khozhgov, a former brother-in-law of Tsarnaev, told CNN Tsarnaev once introduced him to someone by that name who was an Armenian convert. He said he was not told Misha's full name. "It seemed to me that Misha had influence on Tamerlan," apparently encouraging him to give up boxing because it "is violent," Khozhgov told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "Tamerlan told me that he quit boxing and music because Misha was teaching that it's not good in Islam to do those things." "Misha" taught Tsarnaev "things that would make Tamerlan go away from the people and go more into the religion," Khozhgov said, but "I didn't witness him making him radical." Khozhgov added that he has not spoken with Tsarnaev or with the younger suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, since 2010. And even then, "We didn't talk for a long time." Tamerlan Tsarnaev "seemed normal" at the time, he added. "He only told me he goes to the mosque often and he's doing community work at the mosque." Officials have not responded to requests for comment on someone named "Misha." Lawmakers briefed Tuesday on the investigation told CNN they had not heard of anyone by that name. The Islamic Society of Boston told CNN Wednesday that so far no one in its network reported knowing a "Misha" who fit that description. "We are looking for him," said spokeswoman Nichole Mossalam. Uncle called a friend to investigate Tsarni, Tsarnaev's uncle, told CNN he was so concerned about someone brainwashing his nephew that he called a family friend in the Cambridge area to investigate. "I said, 'Listen, do you know what is going on with that family? With my brother's family?' Then he says ... there is a person, some new convert into Islam of Armenian descent," Tsarni told CNN's Shannon Travis. "Armenians, I have no intention to say anything about Armenians. It's a neighboring region with North Caucasus," the same area where the Tsarnaev family also hails from. "It started (in) 2009. And it started right there, in Cambridge," Tsarni said of the friendship. Aunt reveals clue to older brother's trip to Russia Tsarnaev's mindset leading up to the bombings at the Boston Marathon may never be fully known. He was killed after a shootout with police last week. His brother, Dzhokhar, remains hospitalized with an array of gunshot wounds. He has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been communicating with investigators in a limited fashion. He has indicated that his older brother, not any international terrorist group, conceived the deadly attack, a U.S. government source said. The preliminary interviews with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suggest the two brothers fit the classification of self-radicalized jihadists, the source said. But the official noted that information from the preliminary interviews needed to be scrutinized. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has also cited the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as motivating factors behind last week's blasts that killed three and wounded hundreds more, a U.S. government official said. Suspect's widow is distraught The suspects' uncle said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was clearly the leader between the two brothers. "Dzhokhar is being used by his older brother. (Tamerlan) used him as his -- not even accomplice -- as some kind of instrument," Tsarni said. At 26, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was seven years older than Dzhokhar. Friends say Dzhokhar followed his big brother around like a puppy. And as their father is in Russia, the older brother may have become a father figure to the 19-year-old these past few months. At 6-foot-3, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was, by many accounts, an intimidating presence with increasingly strong convictions about society and religion in recent years. Tsarni said he was shocked by the explosions and how his nephews may be involved. "Tamerlan is off now," the uncle said. "There is no obedience and respect to his own father. That concerns me big time." CNN's Shannon Travis, Jake Tapper, Brian Todd and Wayne Drash contributed to this report.
President Barack Obama's commission investigating last year's oil disaster is giving environmental groups hope that some change is on the horizon, but not the full scope of what they're looking for, two groups told CNN Thursday. "If you take the findings to heart, you wouldn't start drilling again," said Kert Davies, research director with Greenpeace. On Wednesday, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a chapter of its coming report, saying "systemic" problems caused the blowout and that only "significant reform" would prevent another. "The Macondo blowout was the product of several individual missteps and oversights by BP, Halliburton, and Transocean, which government regulators lacked the authority, the necessary resources, and the technical expertise to prevent," the report says. Macondo was the name of the well. BP, Halliburton and Transocean all were involved in the drilling operation. Greenpeace and the Sierra Club told CNN there were no surprises in the released chapter. "It kind of confirms our worst fears that we've had about the oil industry all along -- that they cut corners where they can," said Athan Manuel, director of lands protection with the Sierra Club. "And that sometimes threatens the safety and operation of their rigs." Manuel said he believes the president will take the commission's findings seriously. "Administratively, we're confident that the Obama administration will change the way oil companies do business in the Gulf." But, he said, his group is not holding out hope for major legislative change. "I imagine that the Republicans in charge of the Natural Resources Committee, and now the new speaker, don't want to see any new restrictions on the oil industry," he said. Greenpeace's Davies said the chapter released "puts an exclamation point on the fact that the corporations were at fault," though he noted that a lack of government oversight also is to blame. "What we hope is that the commission's recommendations are taken to heart by the president," he said. But Davies added, "We don't have very high hopes for the reforms that should happen -- a massive overhaul of the regulatory apparatus and oversight." "Ultimately," he said, "I think the oil industry will succeed in blocking things like that." The group Ocean Conservancy also weighed in with a statement, saying the early draft indicates the commission "will recommend important reforms." The group added, "We now look to the government and industry to step up to the plate." The American Petroleum Institute, the main group representing the oil industry, told CNN Thursday it did not yet have a response to the chapter released by the commission. Halliburton issued a response, accusing the commission of having "selectively omitted information we provided to them." The company also disagreed with certain specifics, saying the report mischaracterized foam stability tests. Transocean issued a statement saying its crew had taken "appropriate actions to gain control of the well. They were well trained and considered to be among the best in the business." BP spokesman Robert Sholars said Wednesday the oil giant "has cooperated fully with the commission's investigation," stressing that "the accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple companies." "BP is working with regulators and the industry to ensure that the lessons learned from Macondo lead to improvements in operations and contractor services in deepwater drilling," Sholars said. The U.S. Department of the Interior said it, too, is already implementing reforms. "The agency has taken unprecedented steps and will continue to make the changes necessary to restore the American people's confidence in the safety and environmental soundness of oil and gas drilling and production on the Outer Continental Shelf, while balancing our nation's important energy needs," spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said.
there are a few challenging spots -- in a few hours. Here's a look at some of the highlights. Starting point: Onomichi As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station. Manager Katsunori Takahashi is huge cycling enthusiast, and it shows. You can park your bike in your room, and there's even a cycle-through restaurant. Taiwanese bike manufacturer Giant has a store in U2 catering to cyclists: bikes, accessories, repairs. U2's Shima Shop sells local produce such as lemon comfiture and dried debera (five-spot flounder), an Onomichi delicacy. As for Onomichi itself, the town was built on a hillside overlooking the sea, so the best way to see it before you head onto the Shimanami Kaido is to catch the ropeway to the top of Senkoji Hill and enjoy the panorama. The walk down the Path of Literature is pleasant -- it winds past past boulders engraved with works by famous writers who've stayed in Onomichi over the centuries. You'll see the splendid Senkoji Temple, which dates from 806 AD, one of the oldest temples in Japan. A stamina boost comes in the form of Onomichi's legendary ramen. Tsutafuji is one of the most popular ramen shops in town. It's a mom and pop waterfront bar near the JR station that's been open more than 50 years. There are just 10 stools inside, so you may have wait a while. Once inside, you'll get a bowlful of noodles topped with pork in a pork-bone-and-fish broth. 'Orchard of Japan' After a day in Onomichi, it's time to roll. As soon as you've crossed Onomichi Strait and reached Mukaishima Island, you'll find yourself in a serene realm of citrus groves, set in the folds of forest-clad mountains. Citrus is big business here. The town of Setoda is Japan's number one producer of lemons, while Ehime Prefecture is known as the Orchard of Japan. There are tangerines, oranges and hybrid fruits unique to these islands, such as anseikan (a cannonball-sized grapefruit). Citrus-related products abound: cakes, jams, honey, sauces, juices. World's longest suspension bridge As you breeze across the routes magnificent bridges (seven of them), a labyrinth of misty islands unfolds below. There are inhabited islands, desert islands and islands that are no more than a rock with a lone pine tree clinging to it. A procession of trawlers, tugs and speedboats glides in and out the channels. As for those bridges, their exquisite state of the art forms make them an attraction in their own right. Tatara is one of the world's longest cable-stayed bridges -- its elegant 220-meter-high steel towers represent the folded wings of a crane. At 4,045 meters long, Kurushima Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the world. Temples, fusion food, stunning sea Deep in the heart of rural Japan, there's a rich amount of art and culture to enjoy. Kosanji Temple on Ikuchijima Island is a must-visit. Built in 1936 by Buddhist priest Koso Kosanji in memory of his mother, this wonderland of temples, pagodas and natural beauty took more than 30 years to complete. Each building is modeled on famous temple buildings in Kyoto, Nikko and elsewhere, so visiting is like taking a stroll through Japanese history. For the perfect ending to a trip (should you choose to loop back the way you came) you can't go wrong with the Bella Vista Hotel in the hills outside Onomichi. The rooms are huge and offer views over the supreme serenity of the island-dotted sea. There's exquisite fusion in the hotel's Italian restaurant (blowfish and tagliarini). The hotel spa is open to the elements on one side, allowing fresh ocean breezes to cool your skin as you boil to a jelly while watching Jupiter rise over the Seto Sea. Travel info Shinkansen bullet trains depart Tokyo regularly for Shin-Onomichi station -- the trip takes about 4.5 hours. Domestic flights between Tokyo and Hiroshima take about an hour and 20 minutes. Bicycles can be rented for 500 yen a day (children 300 yen). Tolls totaling 500 yen (about $5) are required for all bridge crossings. By car, the tolls are about 4,000 yen one way. A free shuttle bus to the Bella Vista Hotel runs from Onomichi JR station. The Tourist Office in the station can arrange it for you. Steve John Powell is a Hiroshima-based travel writer who has contributed to the Japan Times, CNN Travel and the South China Morning Post.

of which about 12,000 Americans. The WHO did not recommend a travel ban then either. And the United States never banned travel from China, the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven-month period as the Ebola epidemic. In fact, U.S. airports never implemented SARS passenger screenings at airports at a time when many other countries did. So why are politicians so certain a travel ban is the right way to go here? Simply put, a lot of members of Congress just want to keep the disease out of the United States and prevent any more cases from spring up at home. And they believe the best way to do that is to bar anyone who's been in West Africa recently -- or who has a passport from one of those countries. U.S. health officials grilled on Ebola at congressional hearing Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms. And Rep. Fred Upton said Ebola "needs to be solved in Africa, but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in. Period." OK, that sounds like it makes sense. Why are health experts saying the ban's a bad idea? The CDC's Frieden gets why that's the knee-jerk reaction to such a deadly disease. But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa. And without that crucial information, Frieden said people infected with Ebola could slip into the United States without the CDC being able to track and monitor them for symptoms. But aren't more than two dozen African countries now enforcing some kind of travel ban? Yes. A few of the neighboring West African countries have actually sealed their borders altogether while many other countries on the continent are banning travel to and from those West African countries. But it's not clear how effective those bans are at keeping West Africans out in a region known for especially porous borders. "Even when governments restrict travel and trade, people in affected countries still find a way to move and it is even harder to track them systematically," Frieden said last week. So you're saying it probably wouldn't work? Nope. At least not according to health officials. In fact, there are no direct flights to the United States from either Libera, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the three most affected countries. There are direct flights from Nigeria, which has dealt with 20 cases, but that country has been much more effective in containing the outbreak. Latest Ebola developments How else could a travel ban hurt? The ban would especially hurt efforts in West Africa to contain the disease, where foreign health care workers have been central to the fight against the epidemic. And if American health workers are afraid they can't return to the United States, they might decide not to go at all. Preventing the disease from spreading further in West Africa is crucial to keep Ebola from continuing to spread. Complete coverage on Ebola
Roselia Rios cried as cameras rolled and headlines trumpeted a castaway's survival after more than a year adrift. The dramatic rescue in the Marshall Islands brought heartbreaking news for Rios: Jose Salvador Alvarenga had survived, but her son, who was with him, had perished at sea. "For me, it was a devastating blow," she told CNN last week. "The pain is so great I can't explain it. I wouldn't wish this on anybody. Losing a child is the hardest thing to bear in life." Her son, 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, set sail from Mexico with Alvarenga in late 2012. Both men were members of a small fishing cooperative and had planned to spend a day catching sharks. But something went terribly wrong. Winds blew them off course, a storm raged and their engines failed, Alvarenga told authorities. Four weeks into their drift, according to Alvarenga, Cordova died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles. Eventually, he said, he threw the body overboard. "What else could I do?" Alvarenga said. Now, as Alvarenga begins his journey home to El Salvador, Rios is grieving her son's death, more than a year after he went missing. His bedroom in the family's home in the village of El Fortin, Mexico, remains exactly as he left it -- a simple green plaid blanket draped over the bed. Jovani Cordova says his brother was kind and worked hard to help their family. "He was responsible for my mother. In fact, he worked in the sea because of her," he said. "He wanted to improve himself. He didn't want to be poor like us." The road in the rural community is so bad it's easier to travel by boat. A short ride took Cordova to where he worked, the nearby town of Costa Azul. Members of the cooperative, where fishermen make an average of $150 a week, still remember the frantic search to find him and Alvarenga after their boat went missing. "My colleagues went to fish, and the next day they told me by radio that the engine failed and the GPS device was wet. We went to search for them for seven or eight days with the authorities," said Bellarmino Rodrigues, who owned the boat. "The governor gave us a small aircraft, but it was impossible to find them." Back at the family home, Rios told CNN she was focused on one thing. "As a mother, I demand that the authorities allow me to talk to the survivor," she said last week. "Only in that way will I know what happened and what he did with the body of my son. I deserve the truth." CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.
By now you've either heard about or read George Will's controversial column on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. Will's take is that the numbers are "preposterous" and using "simple arithmetic" he can prove the "supposed campus epidemic of rape" just ain't so. Worse, Will believes that progressivism, the Obama administration, a college hook-up culture and shady math are turning survivors of sexual assault into a "coveted status that confers privilege." He goes on to claim that efforts to address the issue on campuses is "making everyone hypersensitive, even delusional, about victimizations." I'd no more want to have a conversation with George Will about sexual assault on college campuses than I wish to discuss racism with Donald Sterling. Both men are shockingly out of touch with reality. The fact is, George Will is so wrong. 1. George Will argues that "Washington" and "progressivism" are to blame for creating a "supposed" epidemic of campus rape. Wrong. Colleges prefer to sweep sexual assault cases under the rug, but students have brought the issue to light. In 2011, 16 Yale students and alumni filed a Title IX sexual assault complaint against the university. Other similar lawsuits emerged across the nation. As of this moment, there are 55 universities and colleges under investigation by the federal government. When Dartmouth (my alma mater) was confronted with the problem, the university experienced an astounding 14% drop in college applications. Unlike George Will, the president of Dartmouth College, Philip Hanlon, hit it head on: "From sexual assaults on campus ... to a culture where dangerous drinking has become the rule and not the exception ... to a general disregard for human dignity as exemplified by hazing, parties with racist and sexist undertones, disgusting and sometimes threatening insults hurled on the Internet ... to a social scene that is too often at odds with the practices of inclusion that students are right to expect on a college campus in 2014. The actions I have detailed are antithetical to everything that we stand for and hope for our students to be. There is a grave disconnect between our culture in the classroom and the behaviors outside of itâ€”behaviors which too often seek not to elevate the human spirit, but debase it." 2. George Will suggests that women, hook-up culture, alcohol, anything but men, are to blame. He cites an example of a student from Swarthmore College in 2013 and condenses her report into two paragraphs -- as if it's representative of most sexual assault cases. Is he trying to find a way to blame women? Women who drink. Women who say no and fall asleep. Are they giving up their right to say no if they pass out or fall asleep? What about the morality of the man's actions? What respectable young man rolls himself on top of a drunk, sleepy corpse of a woman and forces her to have sex, after she had said no? Take 25 seconds and watch this brilliant PSA on what a guy should do if he finds himself with a woman passed out, asleep on his couch, or in his bed. It's really simple and there's no gray area or ambiguity: Good guys respect women. Creeps and criminals take advantage of women. 3. By addressing the problems, colleges are turning sexual assault victims into a "coveted status." Ask any woman who's been the victim of a sexual assault, unwanted groping, or date rape and you'll learn there's nothing to covet. And most definitely it's not a privilege. Dr. Jen Gunter, who wrote an open letter to George Will, offers a powerful first-hand perspective that will tell you what goes through the mind of a rape survivor. Victims often feel shame, guilt and fear. When they try to report it, they'll be questioned about their conduct, whether there's any drinking involved, what they were wearing, whether they've had sex with the man before. If it's serious enough and not a "micro-aggression" the attacker might be quietly punished, in a way that makes sure that no parents find out. But the victim has to deal with whispers and rumors. 4. The simple arithmetic doesn't make George Will's point powerful. George Will makes a big stink about whether it's true that "one in five women" could possibly be sexually assaulted during college. I could make arguments to counter his math. But let's do this: What if we say there are "only" one in 20 women who are sexually assaulted, rather than one in five? Does that make this problem less of a problem? Are those women who are raped less deserving of help? If armed robberies on campus happened to one in 20, or one in 20 students got the measles or food poisoning, we would call it an epidemic. Simply focusing on the validity of the numbers is not a way to invalidate the obligation and importance of universities taking this problem seriously. 5. "I take sexual assault more seriously than you do." In his response to the backlash, George Will pulled out the Donald Sterling "I'm not a racist and I've never been a racist" defense. He says, "I think I take sexual assault much more seriously than you do. Which is why I worry about definitions of that category of crime that might, by their breadth, tend to trivialize it." Actually, it's George Will who's trivializing the problem. When he summarizes a single story of sexual assault with a giant incredulous eye roll and suggests that a woman's conduct should be scrutinized more than a man's in assessing whether a sexual assault even occurred -- he is trivializing a creepy and criminal act. The reason why so many women haven't come forward until now is because victims assumed nothing would happen, or even worse, they'd face someone like George Will who'd put the blame right back on the victim.
Think of five children you know. One of them may suffer from a serious debilitating mental illness. If this child is your own, finding answers to the question "How can I help my child?" can be daunting and overwhelming. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 20% of Americans under the age of 18 live with or have experienced a seriously debilitating mental disorder. And unfortunately many of those suffering from mental illness ultimately choose suicide as the  way out. According to the Centers for Disease Control, suicide is ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in Americans over the age of 10. Gesine Sauter, a licensed mental health counselor at the Karen Horney Clinic in Manhattan, says suicide is the third-leading cause of death among people ages 15-24. But there are ways to help and resources available if you feel a loved one might be suicidal. "If you detect any of the risk factors and you are concerned about someone, always directly ask if he or she feels suicidal. You do not plant any suicidal thoughts or bring the other [person] closer to taking action. Just the opposite: being asked can be the first step or chance for the suicidal individual to experience a sense of relief just by being able to share some of his or her anguish and feeling less alone," Sauter says. While a diagnosis of mental illness or disorder of any level of severity can seem overwhelming to a parent, there are resources available to support families on their journey through diagnosis and treatment. Here are just a few: The Balanced Mind Foundation offers support and for parents and guardians of children with mood disorders. The nonprofit provides online support groups, a professional resource directory, and a family helpline where families can submit questions to trained parent volunteers. They have twenty-eight support groups listed on their website that address the needs of all ages from toddler to what they call "transition age" or in their twenties suffering from depression or bipolar disorder as well as their family members. The goal of the Balanced Mind Foundation is to see these children thrive in spite of their disorders because they are receiving the proper care and support they deserve. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) provides a Peer-to-Peer Recovery Educational program geared toward healthy living strategies and skill-building resources for adults. The course is free, confidential and led by trained individuals in recovery from mental illness. They also facilitate a discussion group called Teen Consumers, which provides a healthy environment for teens to discuss their diagnoses and treatments. NAMI has a support group for parents of teens with mental illness, as well. The nonprofit's website also provides a state-by-state directory of local support groups. NAMI offers an information hotline for general information, referrals and support: 1-800-950-6264. Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET on weekdays. The Autism Society's  approach is to focus on each individual child's needs. They preach a message that no method is the right method for all children diagnosed with autism. Their goal is to provide parents with many options and different avenues of advice and support. The Autism Society created  Autism Source, a comprehensive database of local professional services. Visitors to the website can explore a wide range of resources, including housing needs, medical professionals and educational services. The Treatment Advocacy Center is a nonprofit that works to promote policies that support people with severe mental illness. The website features a link that connects these families and individuals to treatment options, legal resources and crisis response strategies. The Arc is a national community-based organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. In their mission statement, the team from the Arc promotes a people-first approach and "believes that all people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are defined by their own strengths, abilities and inherent value, not by their disability." The strive to make those affected and their families' lives better through policy, support systems and education.
The larger-than-life story of baseball great Jackie Robinson will open on the big screen this month along with the beginning of the new baseball season. "42" is slated to open on April 12, just three days before the 66th anniversary of Robinson's debut game that broke baseball's color barrier. The film follows Robinson, the first African-American to play Major League Baseball, as he plays for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and highlights the bond that formed between Robinson and Dodgers general manager and president, Branch Rickey. Rickey is played by Harrison Ford, who was not originally on the shortlist for the part. "The filmmakers didn't send (the script) to me, I just happened upon it," Ford recently told CNN. "I came through backdoor channels and I read it and I thought this is a great opportunity to play this character if anybody's interested in seeing me about it." Except no one was. "They would not have known about my ambition to play this kind of character in a faithful way ... to approach it as a character actor and be willing and ready to let loose of my former career as a leading man." After some persuasion, Ford landed the role of Rickey -- although, true to his intent to get lost in the character, you might not even recognize him in the part. When it came to casting Robinson, writer/director Brian Helgeland, who has previously written screenplays for "Man on Fire" and "A Knight's Tale," knew upon meeting Chadwick Boseman that he wanted him to fill the uniform. The actor, who's previously appeared on TV in shows like "Lincoln Heights" and "Persons Unknown," was directing an off-Broadway play at the time of his audition, but just so happened to be in Los Angeles when his agent called about "42." But though Helgeland knew right away, "I definitely didn't know right away," Boseman told CNN. After reading for Helgeland the first time, "I came in the next week and read for him again, and realized that he already made his decision and he was trying to prove it to somebody else. I did a baseball tryout, and the rest is history." Helgeland "said I was the person who showed the most courage, and that's why I got it," Boseman said. Boseman played some Little League baseball as a kid and describes himself as an athlete. "So it wasn't like I couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time," he joked. But he obviously needed practice in order to emulate one of the best in the history of baseball. "We did spring training from the middle of January to May," he said. "We prepared as if we were going to play a game." In order to see how he was shaping up in his attempt to accurately bring Robinson's skills to life, Boseman would watch a split-screen of his own practices next to some of Robinson's Hall of Fame footage -- so he could see "how bad I was" compared to Robinson. Like Boseman, Ford logged hours extensively researching his character, working to understand the ins and outs of the sport, though he's not a huge sports fan generally. "I researched the character and the history, and I know the history. I know the circumstances that took place and the character of our nation at the time, but I didn't know much about the man: Branch Rickey," Ford said. "There was a lot of research material and I took advantage of all of it, and studied it." As for the reason we haven't seen more Jackie Robinson biopics flood cineplexes, Ford muses that it might be because Robinson's wife, Rachel, has been careful with her husband's legacy. "Until Brian Helgeland produced the script, I don't think she'd been satisfied with the telling of the story," Ford said. "And not so much because it glorifies her husband, but because it embraces the fulsome understanding of the circumstances, and so she's responsible for allowing us to tell the story."
The NBA is without a Chinese-born player for the first time in 12 years, after it was announced Yi Jianlian has signed a one-year deal in his homeland. Yi failed to earn a new contract with 2011 NBA champions Dallas Mavericks, and he has returned to China to join former team Guangdong Tigers. "It's a huge pity to spend his prime years on the bench in the NBA without being trusted," Guangdong general manager Liu Hongjiang said of Yi in a statement. "He wants to play and we can provide an ideal stage." Yi carried the flag for China at the recent London 2012 Olympics, his third appearance at the Games. His departure is a blow the league, which is looking to take advantage of the potentially lucrative Asian market. Current NBA star Dwayne Wade, a champion with Miami Heat earlier this year, told CNN that basketball still trails football as the world's favorite sport. The popularity of the NBA in China skyrocketed when center Yao Ming joined the Houston Rockets in 2002. The first Chinese-born player to take to the court in the NBA was Wang Zhizhi, who made history by joining the Mavericks in 2001. The NBA's profile in Asia has been boosted by the emergence of Jeremy Lin, a Taiwanese American who shot to global fame with a string of standout performances for the New York Knicks during the 2011-12 season. Lin, 24, has since left the Knicks to join the Houston Rockets.
At least 42 people were killed and 120 injured by flash flooding and mudslides on the Portuguese island of Madeira, the local civil protection agency said Sunday. An unknown number of people are still missing, the authorities told CNN. About 250 people were evacuated to military bases and other safe locations, said Pedro Barbosa of the civil protection agency. "We have some parts where we can't go because the bridges are down," Barbosa told CNN earlier in the day, saying the numbers of victims may rise as more information comes in. He said all the damage occurred in just a few hours Saturday morning due to "very concentrated, very intense" rains that sparked flooding and mudslides. The mudslides and flooding damaged roads and homes in the capital, Funchal, and in Ribeira Brava, which are both on the southern portion of the Atlantic island. Floodwaters overturned cars and knocked down trees. Search-and-rescue teams have been reinforced, according to the Civil Protection Agency. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates said "the situation is under control" and the government is offering its support to regional authorities. President Cavaco Silva expressed his condolences in a televised statement and promised to do everything to help. Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, is a popular resort destination. There have been no reports of any dead or missing tourists. Barbosa said Saturday's heavy rains were the worst in Madeira since 1993, when a storm killed eight people. Madeira is one of the Madeira Islands, an archipelago about 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) southwest of the Portuguese mainland. CNN's Al Goodman, Per Nyberg and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.
A U.N. expert panel alleges that North Korea exported banned nuclear and ballistic missile technology to several rogue nations. The 75-page report, complied by a seven-member panel reporting to the United Nations Security Council, states that North Korea is involved in "nuclear and ballistic missile-related activities in certain countries, including Iran, Syria and Myanmar" and that special attention should be given by all member countries to inhibit such activities. The report, which was released this week, had been delayed from publication for six months by China, a friendly nation to North Korea, according to a diplomat familiar with the case. The diplomat spoke in a background briefing and did not want to be identified. Read more of CNN's coverage on North Korea The experts write that North Korea is getting around U.N.-imposed sanctions and is masking financial transactions by the use of "overseas entities, shell companies, informal transfer mechanisms, cash couriers and barter arrangements." The report goes on to state that North Korea "has established a highly sophisticated international network for the acquisition, marketing and sale of arms and military equipment, and arms exports have become one of the country's principal sources for obtaining foreign exchange." The report detailed some of the ways is says North Korea -- formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) -- gets around U.N. sanctions: --The DPRK is believed to use air cargo to handle high-valued and sensitive arms exports. Such cargo can be sent by direct air cargo from the DPRK to the destination country. Some modern cargo planes, for example, can fly non-stop from the DPRK to Iran, when routed directly through neighboring air space. --A technique now being used by the DPRK to conceal its arms exports is to ship components for the assembly of arms overseas in the form of "knock-down kits" which can be delivered to foreign assembly plants, the report says. In some cases, this is a turn-key operation with the participation of DPRK scientists, technicians and specialists. The North Korean government had no immediate response to the report. The United Nations Security Council imposed its last sanctions on North Korea in 2009 after the country conducted a nuclear test.
House Democrats are signaling that a final health care bill will drop the government-run public health insurance option favored by liberals but rejected by conservatives from both parties. A House-Senate conference committee will begin negotiations next month on merging health care bills passed by the Democratic majorities in each chamber. However, voting in both chambers was extremely close, raising concerns that a compromise might fail to win the necessary final approval. One of the main differences between the two measures is the public option. The House bill contains the public option as a competitor to private insurers in a national heath insurance exchange open to people now unable to get coverage, but the Senate version lacks a public option. President Obama, who has made health care reform his top domestic priority this year, has expressed general support for a public option but stops short of insisting on the provision. Liberal Democrats in the House have said they want to keep the public option, but one of their leaders -- Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the chamber's third-ranking Democrat -- said Sunday that he could vote for a bill without the government insurance plan. "We want a public option to do basically three things: create more choice for insurers, create more competition for insurance companies and to contain costs," Clyburn said on the CBS program "Face the Nation." "So if we can come up with a process by which these three things can be done, then I'm all for it. Whether or not we label it a public option or not is of no consequence." The Senate health care bill required the support of all 60 members of the Democratic caucus to overcome a Republican filibuster. Such precarious support allowed individual moderates in the Democratic caucus to wield major influence on the bill, with at least two -- Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Ben Nelson of Nebraska -- saying they would oppose the measure if it contained the public option. On Sunday, Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, acknowledged the reality of the Senate politics. Asked on "Fox News Sunday" about the public option, Van Hollen said, "It's not dead, but we also recognize that the Senate was able to just muster the 60 votes." The House could drop the public option if "there are other mechanisms in whatever bill comes out that will keep down premiums," Van Hollen said. Supporters of a public option say it would provide nonprofit competition to private insurers that would bring down costs, but opponents contend that it is the first step toward a government takeover of the health care system. In place of a public option, the Senate bill includes a provision allowing private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage overseen by a government agency. Both the House and Senate bills would permit the creation of nonprofit private insurance cooperatives to increase competition.
New Hampshire Republican political pros are not expecting a big surprise when the state's voters cast their ballots in Tuesday's GOP presidential primary, seeing an easy victory for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. But the race for second place is much less clear. A CNN survey of 52 New Hampshire GOP insiders found that only one thought Romney would lose the primary, and that was to former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. This group included Republican leaders in both chambers of the state Legislature, local elected and party officials, business and conservative interest group leaders, veterans of previous primary campaigns, GOP political consultants and other party activists. (Those surveyed were granted anonymity for their individual responses to encourage candor. The names of the insiders who participated in this survey appear at the end of this article.) The political insiders also thought that while Romney's margin of victory would be substantial, he would not crack 40 percent. When their predictions for what percentage of the vote each candidate would receive were averaged, Romney came out with a victory of 19 percentage points over Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, followed closely by Santorum. Percentage of primary vote expected Mitt Romney -- 37% Ron Paul -- 18% Rick Santorum -- 16% Newt Gingrich --12% Jon Huntsman -- 12% Rick Perry -- 4% Others -- 1 % The CNN insiders closely mirror the most recent statewide poll of likely GOP voters from WMUR and the University of New Hampshire, which indicates a strong lead for Romney, but the same list of other candidates vying for the No. 2 position. Second place could be key coming out of New Hampshire and going into the contentious South Carolina primary January 21. "Other than Romney right now, feels like the junior varsity on the field," said one New Hampshire GOP insider. Another said, "I believe like so many (that) it's Romney's to lose." Since finishing second in the GOP presidential primary here four years ago to Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Romney has continued to court New Hampshire Republican activists and maintained a home on Lake Winnipesaukee, about an hour north of Manchester. So far, none of the other candidates has been able to knock down Romney in a state with a tradition of humbling front-runners. All the other contenders seem to have significant flaws, at least in the eyes of local party activists. Paul: Too 'wacky'? Paul, who commands a loyal following in the state, faces two of the same hurdles that he faced in Iowa: the view among many in the party -- fair or unfair -- that he can't defeat President Barack Obama in November, and his isolationist foreign policy views, which are anathema to many Republicans. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Paul in New Hampshire? Perception that he can't win in the general election -- 50% His stance on foreign policy -- 48% Paul is too extreme for New Hampshire (volunteered) -- 2% "He has a ceiling to grow entirely because of his foreign policy views," one New Hampshire GOP insider said. "He has his bloc; they are passionate and not going anywhere." Others said they feel that Paul's foreign policy stance feeds into a broader impression of 76-year-old congressman and his campaign. "He's often wacky," another GOP insider said. "And his supporters turn off regular voters with their messianic zeal." Santorum: Not enough time Hoping to build on his near-victory in the Iowa caucuses, Santorum has held town-hall meetings throughout the state taking questions from all comers. Doing so earns him points from locals who believe they have a duty to cross-examine White House hopefuls, but it also has led to a number of hard questions about Santorum's strenuous opposition to same-sex marriage, which at times put him on the defensive. Indeed, a slight majority of the New Hampshire GOP insiders said they felt Santorum's stance on social issues was a major handicap for him in the state. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Santorum in New Hampshire? His views on social issues are too conservative for many Republican and independent voters -- 52% He doesn't have enough time or money to capitalize on his Iowa caucus showing -- 44% Both (volunteered) -- 2% Perception that he can't win the nomination -- 2% Indeed, one New Hampshire insider said that brief window between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary helps Santorum because it "minimizes the time for him to spout off on (the) social conservative agenda and turn off late deciders." But others said they thought that if he had had more than a week to campaign, Santorum might have been able to at least partially overcome his perceived liability on social issues. "Despite his social conservative views in New Hampshire, I believe he could gain more momentum here if he had more time because of the kind of grass-roots campaigner he is," one GOP insider ventured. "Not sure he could win, but he could beat Paul." Huntsman: Too moderate? If Santorum has a problem in New Hampshire because some of his views are too conservative, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, who was ambassador to China during the first two years of the Obama administration, has to deal with the view that he's too moderate for the state's GOP primary electorate. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Huntsman in New Hampshire? Perception that he's too moderate -- 50% Perception that he can't win the GOP nomination -- 40% His message has been muddled (volunteered) -- 10% "Yes, he has appeared too moderate, and yes, he is perceived as someone who can't win the nomination," one GOP insider said. "But the reason that both of those have been obstacles for Huntsman is because his message has been all over the place, with no discipline, no definition." Another echoed, "I think his biggest obstacle has been his campaign's confusing messaging. Within the span of a few months, they tried to convey him as the common-sense moderate and the true conservative." Gingrich: Too much of a Washington insider? As for Newt Gingrich, it was clear what his biggest problem was in the New Hampshire -- the view that his business ties to companies such as Freddie Mac left the former House speaker open to the charge that he's part of the influence-peddling culture of Washington. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Gingrich in New Hampshire? His consulting for the government mortgage-giant Freddie Mac and other interests -- 63% His personal life -- 27% Weak staff and campaign in the state (volunteered) -- 8% Consulting and personal life (volunteered) -- 2% "New Hampshire Romney surrogates were pounding him every chance they got," one GOP insider said, citing Gingrich's vulnerability on his consulting ties. The CNN New Hampshire GOP insiders were surveyed from Friday to Sunday afternoon. The survey was conducted over the Internet. The New Hampshire insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers to encourage candid responses. Half of the insiders said they were formally aligned with one of the presidential campaigns, and half said they had neither endorsed nor were they working for any candidate. Here are the names of the participants in the survey: Kevin Abbott, Peter Angerhofer, Charlie Arlinghaus, Richard Ashooh, Brad Blais, Travis Blais, Grant Bosse, Jeb Bradley, Peter Bragdon, Jamie Burnett, Amelia Chasse, Paul Collins, Bradford E. Cook, Thomas Cronin, Fergus Cullen, Michael P. Dennehy, Ed Dupont, Stephen Duprey, Jay Flanders, Jim Foley, Matt Hagerty, Erin Hass, Jennifer Horn, Periklis Karoutas, Rich Killion, Corey Lewandowski, John Lyons, Sean Mahoney, Kerry Marsh, Jim MacEachern, Shannon McGinley, Jim Merrill, Nancy Merrill, Betsy Miller, Jayne Millerick, Maureen Mooney, B.J. Perry, Thomas D. Rath, Stella Scamman, Pete Silva, Nick Skaltsis, Dan St. Hilaire, John Stephen, Sharon Sykas, Donna Sytek, Pamela Tucker, Peter Weeks, Karen Umberger, J.

Allegations surrounding a U.S. investigation that may have involved laundering money for Mexican drug cartels are causing concern on both sides of the border. In Mexico, lawmakers say they are furious and are demanding an investigation. In the United States, a congressman is broadening the oversight of a previous inquiry to include the most recent allegations. Felipe Gonzalez, a federal senator with Mexico's ruling PAN party, says they will demand an investigation to determine whether the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration allowed its agents to launder money, possibly even on Mexican soil, as part of an investigation into the inner workings of Mexican drug cartels. Gonzalez called the situation "really, really bad" and said that "this is not increasing the trust among countries to work together against crime. Furthermore, you can't fight crime by committing criminal acts and violating the law." Last weekend, the New York Times reported that DEA agents "have handled shipments of hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal cash across borders." Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, announced Monday an investigation into the allegations in his role as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Issa said, "These allegations, if true, raise further unsettling questions about a Department of Justice component engaging in a high-risk strategy with scant evidence of success." Furthermore, Issa wrote that the existence of such a program again calls Holder's leadership into question. Tensions stemming from law enforcement actions have long troubled relations between Mexico and the United States. Samuel Gonzalez, a security analyst in Mexico City, says Mexicans are especially sensitive when it comes to their territory. "Of course there's a jurisdiction problem and, in the end, maybe a violation of sovereignty. That has to be determined and find out where the operations were carried out," Gonzalez said. Robert Strang, a former DEA agent, says infiltration of Mexican drug cartels is not only happening, but it's essential in investigations aimed at dismantling Mexican criminal organizations by targeting their finances. "There's only one way really to catch these major drug cartels, the leaders of these cartels, and that's to follow the money, because these leaders don't go anywhere near the drugs themselves. They hire people to do that," Strang said. As an answer to he allegations published by The Times, the DEA issued a statement Tuesday saying, "We do not discuss the operational aspects of law enforcement activities." The statement also said that the DEA has been "working collaboratively with the Mexican government to fight money laundering for years. As a result of this cooperation, we have seized illicit transnational criminal organization money all around the world through our partnership with law enforcement." For Strang, the former DEA agent, the bottom line is whether these actions produce results. "The real question here is whether or not undercover agents need to sell drugs, buy drugs, and launder money. And I've got to tell you, there's no way to make these kinds of great international, sophisticated conspiracy cases unless you're going to do that," he said. Last month, a small group of Mexican legislators requested the extradition of American agents involved in Operation Fast and Furious. This operation, run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, allowed the illegal smuggling of firearms from the United States into Mexico in an effort to learn about smugglers. Many weapons were lost and likely ended up in criminal hands. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to answer key questions about Operation Fast and Furious as he appears Thursday before a congressional panel including Issa, who also is leading the congressional investigation into the flawed gun sting program.
A series of explosions in eastern Afghanistan killed at least one person and wounded six on Sunday, officials said. In the first attack, a car bomb targeted a building belonging to National Directorate of Security, near the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, a government spokesman said. The early morning blast killed one person and wounded two others, provincial spokesman Ahmad Zia Abdulzai said. In a second attack, a minibus packed with explosives targeted a police checkpoint in Logar province, said Den Mohammad Darwish, provincial government spokesman said. That blast wounded three people, he said. And in a third attack, a suicide bomber detonated his vest at the gate of a police headquarters in the Baraki Barak district of Logar province, police said. One police officer was wounded, said Raees Khan, chief of security for Logar police. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the group was responsible for all three attacks, but gave different casualty tolls for each. He said the attack in Nangarhar province killed 14 people, the minibus blast in Logar province wounded 20, and the suicide bombing in Logar province killed 13. The Taliban are known for claiming responsibility for attacks and inflating casualty numbers. Separately, a would-be suicide bomber was shot and killed in Kabul before he could carry out an attack, police said. The man was driving a car packed with explosives and tried to enter the area of the Internal Security and High Peace Council offices in Kabul, Deputy Police Chief Daoud Amin said. He was also wearing a suicide vest, Amin said. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said the group was not responsible for the planned attack in Kabul. CNN's Karen Smith and Holly Yan contributed to this report.
and that number could rise. They are among the more than 500 African migrants believed to have been aboard a boat that sank off the island last Thursday. The tragedy amounted to Italy's deadliest migrant shipwreck and, according to Lampedusa Mayor Giusi Nicolini, "the biggest sea tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea since World War II." The survivors -- 155 of them, mainly from Eritrea, who swam for their lives and were lucky enough to be rescued by fishermen and the Coast Guard -- wait in a cramped migrant detention center. It was built to hold about 250 people but has held many times that in recent days. Each day, more people are leaving on ferries for other detention centers along the Italian coast, though 900 nonetheless remained Tuesday. Opinion: Europe must be open to refugees fleeing persecution The traumatic firsthand accounts are helping build a picture of why the boat ended up on the seabed of the Mediterranean with most of its passengers entombed below deck. One of them, 30-year-old Germani Nagassi, told CNN he'll never forget what he saw. "For five hours we were floating, using the dead bodies of our companions," he said. "There is nothing worse than this. There were many children. There was a mother with her four children, a mother with an infant, all lost at sea. My mind is scarred and in a terrible condition." Survivors mourn victims of Italy shipwreck Perilous journey, then 13 days at sea The voyage to Lampedusa was supposed to be one of the migrant's last on a long, sometimes painful journey to a new life. Take a woman named Santa, who asked not to use her family name, for fear of retaliation against her family back home in Eritrea. The single mother of a 4-year-old boy felt she had to escape the coastal east African nation, where she had no money for food or medical care. It was not done on a whim, especially given smugglers' demands. "Our relatives and friends sold all that they had -- some little gold jewels, a piece of land or their house -- to sponsor our trip," Santa said. That trek took her across Africa -- jammed tight in jeeps crossing the Sahara Desert with only a few biscuits and juice to sustain them, packed in garages, occasionally beaten with a plastic water pipe if they talked or raised their eyes, she recalled. Santa and others' hope was simple: to have a better life. But the boat's sinking first threatened her life, and now that she's in Italian custody, her future. "It's absurd," she said. "We come here, we work to pay our families back -- if we don't die." She and others spent 13 days at sea before their boat's engine stopped less than a mile from Lampedusa, Italy's closest island to Africa about halfway between Sicily and Tunisia. It's a common destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and a common site of shipwrecks. Lampedusa: Why tough penalties will not work Fire on board There's been criticism that more was not done to help, that the Italian coast guard was too slow to respond, that they spent precious time filming footage of the rescue instead of saving more lives. Hamid Mohammad, 18, swears an Italian vessel spotted them in trouble off the coast, but did nothing. "The Italian's boat started circling around us. They circled our boat twice, then just went away," he said. "That's when people started to panic." The boat's captain told the passengers to set fire to clothes and blankets to attract attention. "He gathered some clothes and bed sheets and lit them. But his container of benzene exploded," Mohammad said. The fire then spread, and when many of the migrants crowded to one side, the boat capsized, said Italian lawmaker Mario Marazziti, citing survivors' accounts. "People were screaming as the boat capsized," Mohammed said. The lucky few In response to criticism, the coast guard Saturday defended its response time and said its crews were on site 20 minutes after receiving the SOS call. "The moment we got the emergency call from the fishermen at 7 a.m., we immediately intervened and started coordinating the rescue operations," said coast guard spokesman Filippo Marini. Abrahalli Amare, 23, was one of the lucky few who were eventually rescued. "We left our country because of hardship, so that we could live in peace and help our families," Amare said."But we have found this bitter sadness. It was so unexpected, so disturbing. And now we can't think of anything else." In July: Pope prays for lost refugees on Lampedusa
and now doctors and members of Congress say they're concerned the Food and Drug Administration might have missed the problem for decades. CRE outbreak: You're due to go in for a procedure. Should you? "This problem has been known since at least 1987," said Allen, the president of the American Gastroenterological Association. "It certainly is disturbing that a fundamental design issue with these scopes would cause problems for this long." On Thursday, the FDA issued advice to hospitals that in addition to following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions, they should "meticulously" clean by hand the specific portion of the device believed to harbor the bacteria. According to FDA spokewoman Leslie Wooldridge, this is the first time the FDA communicated such advice for duodenoscopes. On Monday, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, called for congressional hearings. "For the life of me, I don't understand why the FDA didn't issue this advice until now," he said. "I want to know what the FDA knew and when did they know it." Understanding CRE, the 'nightmare' superbug Dr. William Maisel, deputy director of science and chief scientist at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said it wasn't until 2013 that there was "convincing evidence" that duodenoscopes could harbor antibiotic-resistant infections even when the manufacturer's cleaning instructions were followed properly, and the agency issued the advisory last week after doing research "so we felt we understood the issue sufficiently." Over the years, the FDA also received dozens of reports about infections from duodenoscopes. "We receive a million adverse event reports [on various devices] each year, and we evaluate the reports based on the information that's provided," he said. But outside the FDA, there was significant concern before 2013 that duodenoscopes -- in particular a small mechanism called the elevator wire -- were difficult if not impossible to clean thoroughly. In 2010, safety expert Lawrence Muscarella published an article in the journal Endoscopy calling for special attention to the elevator wire, and in 2011, a consortium of medical societies warned that automatic cleaning processes didn't always effectively disinfect duodenoscopes and so manual cleaning should be performed. But some experts question whether even the most meticulous and diligent manual cleaning will get all the bacteria. After an outbreak in 2013, a hospital in Illinois tried to get the highly lethal superbug CRE out of a duodenoscope and failed, according to Allen. "They really went to extremes, but they still couldn't decontaminate the scope, and they finally had to just destroy it," said Allen, now the clinical chief of digestive diseases at Yale School of Medicine. Doctors hope that manufacturers will come up with a plan soon. "I do think it will take a redesign of the scope to solve the problem, or new sterilization technology," said Dr. Bret Peterson, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the 2011 guidelines from the medical societies. Olympus, which manufactured the scope used at UCLA, did not respond to CNN's requests for comments specific to this story. "This is clearly a matter that needs addressing," said Dr. John Greene, an infectious disease expert at the Moffitt Cancer Center who published an article in 2013 on a duodenoscope outbreak in Tampa. "We really should have done this sooner."
People are interesting, so if you talk to enough people, you're bound to learn interesting things. That's the fortune-cookie version of CNN.com's philosophy when it comes to comments. CNN.com gets thousands of comments on its stories every day. They can be thought-provoking, vulgar, inspiring, offensive or hilarious, but they're rarely boring. Our audience makes valuable contributions to CNN's coverage by giving us a broader view of the day's events. Our Health unit recently published a story about phobias that referenced actress Salma Hayek's fear of snakes and quoted a San Diego woman with a fear of vomit. It's an interesting story and dozens of people jumped in to discuss their fears of sharks, heights, crowds, blood and even wet paper. That conversation gave an even better understanding of a problem that affects more than 19 million American adults. We also read through the comments to see which stories are generating buzz and deserve follow-ups, and to look for new story ideas and fresh angles. It's not all rainbows and unicorns and people can be mean, but we have moderators and other mechanisms in place to help keep things civil.

Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the president of the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday. Germany's Ina Menzer, left, fights American Franchesca Alcanter during a WIBF and WBC featherweight bout in May. The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. "I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing," IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. "I think it's a great decision. Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.  "The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games."  Have your say - should women's boxing be included? A men's class will likely be axed to make room for three women's weight categories at London 2012, the UK Press Association reported. Women will compete in the flyweight 48-51kg class, lightweight 56-60kg and middleweight 69-75kg, the agency said. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal. Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120. As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular. Women's boxing has boomed in Britain since 2005, with the number of registered female fighters rising from 50 to 600, PA reported. Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. Blog: IOC has picked the wrong sports, says CNN's Paul Gittings The IOC has not yet selected the host city for 2016, but its board members will submit golf and rugby to the full IOC session for a final decision at its meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October. "Golf and rugby scored high on all the criteria," Rogge told the IOC's official Web site. "They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play." The International Golf Federation has proposed two four-day strokeplay tournaments for men and women, with 18 holes per round and medals awarded to the three players in each with the lowest scores. The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.
Storyteller Mark Twain ignited an American love affair with the Mississippi River in the late 1800s with his vivid descriptions in "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and "Life on the Mississippi." Twain described river towns as "pleasing to the eye and cheering to the spirit" and called the Mississippi Valley "as reposeful as a dreamland ... nothing to hang a fret or a worry upon." More than a century later, the romance of the mighty Mississippi, along with a number of other U.S. waterways, continues to attract those seeking an authentic slice of Americana, and a number of cruise lines cater to travelers looking for such a floating escape. Onboard today's passenger vessels you're likely to find a library with a book or two by Twain -- along with fine dining, live entertainment, expert lecturers and multiple options for relaxing, or maintaining a fitness regime. Trips gone wrong: Movie moments U.S. river cruising has been growing in popularity for many reasons: These journeys have a European feel with no passport required, they work for multiple generations traveling together, and the logistics make it a breeze compared with getting on a plane or even sailing with the bigger cruise lines. Traditionally filled with a more mature travel crowd, they aren't cheap. But those who take one river cruise tend to take more; one popular outfit, American Cruise Lines, reports a repeat guest rate of 40% on average. Here are eight ways to explore the United States via river cruise: Memphis to New Orleans: Lower Mississippi River You'll still hear the traditional notes of the calliope as you board the historic Queen of the Mississippi, but 21st-century technology also brings this American Cruise Lines paddlewheel riverboat to a new level of comfort and convenience. Eight-day voyages cruise from Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans; St. Louis; or St. Paul, Minnesota, on the iconic Mississippi River. The cruise between Memphis and New Orleans highlights the music, cuisine and culture of these two vibrant cities but allows plenty of time to soak up the setting that Twain called "reposeful as a dreamland," with stops at sprawling Southern plantation homes and Civil War battlefields. Also onboard: a putting green and a workout area. Rates begin at $4,195 per person. St. Paul to St. Louis: Upper Mississippi River Every autumn, when the riverbanks are drenched in shades of red and gold, the elegant flagship vessel of the American Queen Steamboat Co. travels the Upper Mississippi River, with stops that include a glimpse of Amish country in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and a tribute to the agricultural accomplishments of John Deer in Davenport, Iowa. Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal, Missouri, is also on the itinerary. Other themed sailings on the American Queen honor everything from baseball legends to Route 66, and longer itineraries sail on multiple rivers. Rates begin at $2,495 per person for the nine-day journey, $4,495 for a 14-day trip on the Ohio and Mississippi. World's 15 best rivers for travelers Pacific Northwest: Columbia and Snake rivers Set your sights on spring and the inaugural season of the opulent American Empress, the newest addition to the American Queen Steamboat Co. line. Seven-day voyages will travel between Portland, Oregon, and Clarkston, Washington, with stops to visit the natural wonders and historic landmarks of the region such as Mount Hood and the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center. Native American history, a number of wineries and the opportunity to zip-line above Oregon are additional highlights. With five decks and accommodations for 223 guests, it is one of the larger vessels plying U.S. rivers, and American Queen Steamboat President Ted Sykes cites a "rebirth of U.S. river cruising" as one reason for the company's expansion. Rates start at $3,795 per person. Alaska: Waterways near Juneau Small ships can mean big adventure in the 49th state. Think grizzlies and glaciers when you drift through straits and fjords on the Island Spirit, a 32-passenger, all-inclusive boat that leaves Alaska's capital city to explore small towns and coastal cities between wildlife sightings. Onboard naturalists are part of this nine-day journey that can also involve kayaking, hiking and trekking across icy blue glaciers. Inuit culture also is weaved into the itinerary. Book through USA River Cruises; rates start at $3,995 per person. Travel photos we wish we'd taken New York's Hudson River Valley If you're game for some extraordinary leaf-peeping along the river that Henry Hudson explored in 1609, American Cruise Lines offers an eight-day trip leaving from New York City that whisks passengers into the world of millionaire mansions, art centers, maritime museums and two capital cities -- the state's second capital, Poughkeepsie, and the current one, Albany. Set your bags in your cabin and get to the deck; you won't want to miss a minute of daylight with the sun lighting up the Hudson River Valley scenery. You'll pass by the historic Saugerties Lighthouse and have time to tour the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. This itinerary begins and ends in the Big Apple so travelers can start or cap their trip with some big-city fun. Rates begin at $3,245 per person. Charleston, South Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida It's hard to leave the palmetto palms of Charleston, but with this Blount Small Ship Adventure, you'll discover the Lowcountry, get a lesson in Southern history and find proof that Southern hospitality is flourishing along the waterways of the antebellum South. The eight-day trip navigates a handful of rivers and intracoastal waterways, with stops that include Beaufort, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and St. Augustine, Florida. You'll fill your digital camera disc with sunsets, Spanish moss-covered live oaks and idyllic scenes from Jekyll and Amelia islands. Rates start at $2,399 per person. The Great Lakes region: Toronto to Duluth, Minnesota OK, so you'll need your passport for this cruise that dips into Canada. The journey takes you through all five of the Great Lakes, from Lake Ontario to Lake Superior. The 138-passenger Yorktown passes through busy locks and canals on this 11-day trip filled with Great Lake lore as well as excursion options to Niagara Falls, Michigan's pristine Presque Isle and the Victorian-era island of Mackinac. Travelers yearning for still more Americana should head for the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village when the ship docks in Detroit for a day. USA River Cruises handles Yorktown bookings, and every cabin has a water view; rates for the Great Lakes trip start at $5,595 per person. The islands of New England Classic New England is the focus on this tranquil seven-day journey run by Blount Small Ship Adventures. Vessels depart from and return to Warren, Rhode Island, carrying fewer than 100 passengers per trip into the realm of serene beaches, rugged bluffs and unique towns such as Cuttyhunk, Massachusetts, where the tides seem to have washed away any sign of 21st-century stress. Whale watching and birding are priorities as you island hop between Nantucket Island and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and Rhode Island's Block Island, marveling at gorgeous seaside homes and quaint beach cottages decorated in buoys and other nautical relics. Get a taste of New England during shore excursions with lobster lunches, locally crafted beers and freshly made saltwater taffy. Round trip from Warren. Rates start at $1,999 per person.
The storm system that plowed through the South left scenes of destruction described as "surreal" and "sickening" by those who saw them. Authorities were working to reach those trapped; some states are facing a long and arduous recovery. Here's a look at the latest confirmed death toll as provided by state authorities as well as reports from some of the worst-hit areas. OFFICIAL STATE DEATH TOLLS FOR APRIL 27-28 TORNADOES Alabama - 238 Tennessee - 34 Mississippi - 33 Georgia - 15 Virginia - 5 Arkansas - 1 TOTAL - 326 Source: State officials ALABAMA The death toll from the severe weather in Alabama has claimed the lives of at least 238 people, according to state emergency officials. The state Emergency Management Agency reported 18 additional deaths in Marion County, bringing the total number of deaths there to 21. Sheriff Kevin Williams told CNN Friday afternoon that 35 people had died in the county, with the additional deaths not yet included in the official state total. The state listed 20 people as missing in Marion County. Tuscaloosa city officials reported 45 deaths as of Friday afternoon, but later revised that to 39 because of a counting error. That change was not immediately reflected in the state's total. Almost 1,000 people were treated for injuries in the city and 446 people were unaccounted for, although not necessarily missing. President Barack Obama and the first family toured Tuscaloosa on Friday. Obama met with Gov. Robert Bentley and families affected by the storms and promised expedited emergency assistance to the devastated region. "We're going to do everything we can to help these communities rebuild," he told reporters. Medical personnel treated more than 1,700 injured people. Thirty-one of the state's 67 counties were affected by the tornadoes and storms. Bentley declared a statewide state of emergency and mobilized approximately 2,000 Alabama National Guardsmen to provide emergency assistance. Obama signed Alabama's Emergency Declaration and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. --  Tuscaloosa: Mayor Walter Maddox described a surreal scene as the twister plowed through: "There were parts of the city I literally didn't recognize," he told CNN's Eliot Spitzer. "We have hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed, and hundreds more damaged. -- Birmingham: Severe damage was reported in Birmingham's western suburbs; Hueytown, Concord and Pleasant Grove saw "catastrophic damage," said Hueytown Police Chief Chuck Hagler. "I don't think you understand the scale of the devastation," he said. -- Hackleburg: Almost 30 people died in this town in northwest Alabama, according to the sheriff. Schools, businesses and homes were destroyed. -- Cullman: What was thought to be a tornado damaged a hospital, ripped the roof off the courthouse and pummeled a number of residences, authorities said. One person was killed in Hanceville when a tree fell on a car. Counties reporting deaths, according to state authorities: Bibb  -- 1 Calhoun --  9 Cullman -- 2 DeKalb -- 32 Elmore --  6 Fayette -- 4 Franklin -- 27 Hale -- 4 Jackson -- 8 Jefferson -- 19 Lawrence -- 14 Limestone --  4 Madison -- 7 Marion -- 21 Marshall -- 5 St. Clair -- 13 Tallapoosa -- 3 Tuscaloosa -- 45 Walker --  14 TENNESSEE Tennessee emergency officials reported 34 deaths and 107 injuries. Serious flooding was reported in areas of western Tennessee, and more than 130,000 were without power. -- Chattanooga: A 41-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on her mobile home, according to WDEF. Her husband and son told investigators they were taking shelter in a closet when she walked over to a window and was crushed when the tree fell. In Chickamauga Lake, north of Chattanooga, no one was injured when a funnel cloud smashed into the Camp Columbus RV park, destroying several vehicles. Resident John Tripp told CNN affiliate WTVC that he saw the massive tornado form, taking up water as it crossed the lake, before it smashed into the campground. -- Apison: Eight deaths were reported in this community east of Chattanooga. Twenty-eight people were taken to hospitals. GEORGIA The death toll in Georgia stands at 15, officials said Friday. Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency in 16 counties. The state reported 115 injuries. The state has concluded search operations, is conducting preliminary damage estimates and has done aerial surveys. --Catoosa County: Eight deaths occurred here, according to the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. Three were confirmed in the town of Ringgold, according to the Catoosa County Coroner. The town in northwest Georgia has been hit particularly hard, with some buildings entirely demolished, Major Gary Sisk said. In Ringgold, the storm appeared to pick and choose its targets. Some homes were left virtually unscathed, or perhaps had minor roof damage. Others had no roof at all. Still more homes were simply gone, vanished into a pile of rubble. "It just looks like confetti," emergency management spokeswoman Lisa Janak said Friday, adding 300 homes were lost in the county. -- Dade County: Two people were confirmed dead in Trenton, according to Georgia's Emergency Management Agency. -- Spalding County: The sheriff's department confirmed two fatalities. State officials said numerous homes were severely damaged. -- Lamar County: The state confirmed two deaths. -- Rabun County: One death. MISSISSIPPI The death toll from severe weather in Mississippi has risen to 34, according to state emergency officials. More than 150 injuries were reported. One of the 33 deaths was on Tuesday. Another was a firefighter who died Friday after collapsing while clearing storm debris. President Obama signed a disaster declaration for Clarke, Greene, Hinds, Jasper, Kemper, Lafayette and Monroe counties, making individuals living there eligible for federal funds. Damage was reported in 50 counties and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said. Damage assessments were still ongoing, but as of Friday afternoon damage was reported to 1,572 homes. Of those, 551 were deemed destroyed or having suffered major damage. -- Monroe County: At least 14 people were killed in the town of Smithville. Fourteen people there were still missing Friday afternoon. -- McComb: A falling tree killed a 3-year-old girl who was asleep in her bed in the southwest Mississippi town, according to CNN affiliate WLBT in Jackson. -- Kemper County: Three deaths were confirmed in the western Mississippi county, MEMA said. VIRGINIA The death toll from severe weather in Virginia was revised downward from eight to five, according to state emergency officials. Severe storms struck the counties of Goochland, Halifax, Shenandoah and Washington, among others. Four fatalities in Washington County and one in Halifax County have been confirmed, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management.

Chanting "Allahu Akbar" -- God is Greater than any -- more than 2 million pilgrims crossed new pedestrian bridges Saturday to perform one of the last rituals of the Hajj season. Jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations, according to Muslim traditions. The ritual stoning of three pillars, which occurs in the tent city of Mina -- about two miles from Mecca, was the scene of stampedes and many deaths in the 1980s and 1990s as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars on the ground. But this year the Saudi government completed a new project that avoids past congestion at the site. The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $1.2 billion, five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones. Authorities and pilgrims say it's a roomier atmosphere and more efficient way to accommodate the faithful. "Everything went fine so far," Col. Khakled Qarar Mohammadi, head of the emergency forces at Jamarat, told CNN. "It is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with. About 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual. So we have been preparing for this for years now." Irtiza Hasan, a pilgrim from the United States, said all went well at the ceremony. "The only incident I saw was that there were some handicapped women who were turned away in fears that they get hurt." But Mohammadi said, "There are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped. Each van can take up to 14 pilgrims." As a measure to alleviate harm, according to Muslim traditions, the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them. The five-story Jamarat bridge is air-conditioned at 19 degrees Centigrade, or 66 Fahrenheit, throughout the day and backed by water sprinklers that can reduce the temperature to about 29 degrees C, or 84 F. The bridge is designed to allow the addition of seven more levels to hold as many as 5 million pilgrims in the future if the need arises. According to authorities, the bridge is 950 meters (1,039 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) wide. Each floor is 12 meters (13 yards) high with three tunnels and 12 entrances and 12 exits in six directions. It has a helicopter pad for emergencies. According to Mohammadi, the project has 509 advanced closed-circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims' movements. Those cameras feed into the main operations room, which oversees the Jamarat Bridge and the surrounding areas -- all screened by dozens of security officers on 72 monitors at the operation room. The stoning ritual is done over at least two days, where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God's orders to slaughter his son. According to tradition, the event was a test from God, who gave Abraham a ram to slaughter instead. The last ritual that marks the end of Hajj is when pilgrims go from Mina to Mecca to make a last visit to al-Masjid al-Haram, Islam's holiest site, before going back home. The ritual is called Tawaf al-Wada'a -- or farewell circumambulation in the holy mosque. It's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their Lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city.
Real Madrid took a big step toward reaching the second round of the Champions League with a 2-0 home win over Group G rivals AC Milan on Tuesday night, while Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Arsenal also maintained their perfect start to Europe's premier club competition. Real were beaten at home by the Italian side in the group stage last season, but the Spanish league leaders are now a different proposition under new coach Jose Mourinho, who led Inter Milan to final glory in May. The game was virtually over after only 14 minutes as Cristiano Ronaldo and Mezut Ozil scored within 60 seconds of each other. Ronaldo followed up his weekend double against Malaga with a free-kick that went straight through the middle of a poor defensive wall, leaving unsighted goalkeeper Marco Amelia with no chance. It was his fifth goal in three matches. The world's most expensive player then broke down the left and passed inside to Germany midfielder Ozil, whose shot took a wicked deflection off Daniele Bonera and looped over Amelia into the net. Milan went close to pulling a goal back in the 29th minute, but keeper Iker Casillas did well to tip Andrea Pirlo's fierce free-kick onto the crossbar. Real could not translate their attacking dominance into more goals, and in the 83rd minute needed captain Casillas to stop former Madrid forward Robinho from setting up a tense finale after coming on to replace Ronaldinho. Dutch side Ajax moved level with Milan on six points after beating Auxerre 2-1 at home in a match which saw three players sent off in the second half. Netherlands midfielder Demy de Zeeuw fired the four-time champions ahead in the seventh minute and Uruguay striker Luis Suarez made it 2-0 four minutes before halftime. But Ajax were reduced to 10 men in the 56th minute when defender Andre Ooijer brought down Dennis Oliech, allowing and Slovenia international Valter Birsa to score from the subsequent free-kick. However, Auxerre's hopes of earning a first point -- and perhaps a place in the Europa League -- faded when Oliech received his second yellow card for handball. Substitute Jean-Pascal Mignot did not even get on the field as he was ordered from the bench for dissent. German champions Bayern Munich needed two-own goals from Romania's CFR Cluj in order to come from behind and seal a 3-2 home victory in Group E. Ricardo Cadu headed the visitors in front in the 28th minute, but the Portuguese defender deflected a shot by Toni Kroos into his own net four minutes later and teammate Cristian Panin did the same from Holger Badstuber's effort on 37. Germany striker Mario Gomez made it 3-1 from close range with 13 minutes to play for a Bayern side missing several key players before Argentine midfielder Emmanuel Culio scored a late consolation for Cluj, who suffered a second defeat. Swiss side Basel made it three teams on three points with a 3-1 victory away to previously second-placed Roma. Alexander Frei put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute after being set up by a header from strike partner Marco Streller, but Italy forward Marco Borriello leveled nine minutes later from Francesco Totti's first-time throughball. Ghana fullback Samuel Inkoom restored Basel's lead just before the break with a fierce shot, while Roma's Rodrigo Taddei hit the post after the interval before substitute Cabral sealed victory in injury-time. Chelsea clinched a third successive victory in Group F with a 2-0 victory away to previously unbeaten Spartak Moscow in Tuesday's opening match. Russia international Yuri Zhirkov chose the perfect time to score his first goal for the English Premier League champions, lashing home a left-foot volley in the 24th minute after the home defense failed to properly clear a long ball forward. Nicolas Anelka doubled the lead just before halftime after Michael Essien won the ball in midfield and set him free, with the former France striker making up for wasting a similar earlier opportunity. French side Marseille kept alive hopes of reaching the second round, beating Slovakia's MSK Zilina to register their first points. Senegal defender Souleymane Diawara headed the only goal four minutes after halftime for the 1993 champions. Arsenal top Group H after crushing main rivals Shakhtar Donetsk 5-1 at home, with captain Cesc Fabregas marking his return from injury with a second-half penalty. Alexandre Song and Samir Nasri netted in the first half before Spain midfielder Fabregas struck from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Young midfielder Jack Wilshere and striker Marouane Chamakh made it three goals in less than 10 minutes before Croatia striker Edoardo came off the bench to score against his former club in the 82nd minute. Portugal's Sporting Braga won the battle of the group's two pointless teams, winning 2-0 at home to Partizan Belgrade. Lima's long-range free-kick put the competition debutants ahead 10 minutes before halftime, while fellow Brazilian striker Matheus condemned the Serbian side to a third successive defeat from a counter-attack in the final minute.
Iran should release seven Baha'i prisoners accused of espionage because it does not have any evidence against them, their lawyer Shirin Ebadi told CNN on Saturday. Attorneys Abdolfattah Soltani, left, and Shirin Ebadi, shown in Tehran in 2004. "In the files, in the case basically, there is nothing, no reason that basically convicts them," said Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The trial will begin Tuesday despite the fact that one of their lawyers is behind bars and Ebadi is outside the country. Other attorneys can be appointed, Hassan Haddad of the Prosecutor's Office in Tehran told the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. But the court must recognize the replacements, who are colleagues of Ebadi at her Tehran-based Defenders of Human Rights Center, not appoint other lawyers, Ebadi said. The imprisoned lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, is a well-known advocate with the human rights center. He was arrested in the aftermath of Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election and is being held at Evin prison, the same place where his clients are detained, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights. He is being held on charges of taking "measures against national security," Ebadi said. "Mr. Soltani is completely innocent." Soltani had an opportunity to leave prison, but under conditions he chose not to accept, Ebadi said. Along with not giving any interviews after his release, Soltani would also have to end his work with the human rights center and no longer support Ebadi, she said. In another attack on the law firm, a lawyer was arrested after agents entered the center with guns, searched each room and then declared that they found opium on the premises, Ebadi said. That lawyer, whose family had been harassed by police, accused the agents of planting the opium, she said. Ebadi was on a speaking tour when Soltani was arrested and has not returned to Iran. The firm founded by Ebadi took up the case of the seven Baha'is last year. They are accused of spying for Israel, spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and committing religious offenses. The Baha'i International Community, which has a delegation to the United Nations, denies the allegations. The evidence against the defendants includes communication from Israel, but that is because the Baha'i World Center has its headquarters in Israel, said Kit Bigelow, director of external affairs at the American Baha'i Community. Prosecutors are calling that communication espionage, she said. Human rights groups have demanded the release of the prisoners and accused the government of targeting them because of their religious beliefs. The Baha'i faith originated in 19th-century Persia, and while modern-day Iran does not recognize it, the government denies any mistreatment of the members of the largest non-Muslim religious minority. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran has reported a rise in persecution of Baha'is in recent years, including cemetery desecration, arbitrary detention, home raids, property confiscation, work expulsion and denial of basic civil rights. The case of the seven Baha'is has drawn global attention. Roxana Saberi, the Iranian-American journalist freed from Evin prison earlier this year, spoke on their behalf, as have Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan federal commission. The defendants face the death penalty if convicted. Six of the defendants were arrested in May 2008 at their Tehran homes, and one was arrested in the eastern city of Mashad in March 2008, said Diane Ala'i, the Baha'i International Community's representative to the United Nations. The defendants were held under solitary confinement for the first five months of their incarceration, she said. The investigation into the charges against the prisoners concluded months ago and the trial was initially scheduled to start in July. Iran has continued to hold them in Evin prison without access to their lawyers and with minimal contact with their families, Ala'i said. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.
Super Bowl fans in Tucson, Arizona, caught a different kind of show during Sunday's big game. Just as Cardinals' superstar Larry Fitzgerald watched himself sprint into the end zone on the stadium's Jumbotron during Sunday's Super Bowl, 10 seconds of eye-popping pornographic imagery "flashed" across the screens of those watching at home. "We are mortified by last evening's Super Bowl interruption, and deeply apologize to our customers for the inappropriate programming," Comcast Cable said in a written statement. "Our initial investigation suggests this was an isolated malicious act," the statement added. Comcast, and several local television stations that carried the signal, say they are currently investigating what caused the interruption. "It appears this material was only viewed by some Comcast customers," local Tucson television station KVOA-TV said in a written statement. Television station KVOA added "when the NBC feed of the Super Bowl was transmitted from KVOA to local cable providers and through over-the-air antennas, there was no pornographic material," KVOA President and General Manager Gary Nielsen said in a separate statement.
A fire at a hotel in northern Iraq killed at least 28 and wounded 22 others Thursday night, Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government said Friday. A short circuit has been blamed for starting the fire, which broke out at the Soma hotel in the city of Sulaimaniya about 11 p.m. Thursday. Women, children and foreigners were among those killed. "Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this tragic accident, and we wish a speedy recovery to the injured," said Kurdish Prime Minister Barham Salih, who visited the scene of the accident and the hospital where the injured were being treated. "I have ordered an immediate investigation into the accident to establish the causes of the fire and assess the emergency procedures that followed. We will spare no effort in making sure such tragedies do not occur in the future." Sulaimaniya, in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, is the capital of a province of the same name, one of the region's three provinces. It's about 280 kilometers (173 miles) north of Baghdad. During the summer, hotels in the city are usually packed with tourists from southern provinces because Sulaimaniya is considered a safer city and the weather is nicer. Tourists were among those killed, officials said. Jabbar Yawer, spokesman of the local security forces, told CNN that three Asians who work for a local cell phone company were among those killed. The company's headquarters is close to the hotel, and many visiting employees stay there. The Kurdish Regional Government said 14 Iraqi nationals and 14 foreign nationals were killed. The foreigners were from Canada, Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Venezuela, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Bangladesh and Cambodia. One victim remained to be identified, the government said. Earlier, other Kurdish officials said an American and a Filipino were among the dead. Heath officials in Sulaimaniya said that most of those who died were suffocated by smoke because there were no side stairs for an emergency escape in the hotel and the windows are thick and hard to smash. But officials said three young men were able to jump from the hotel's fifth floor in an attempt to save their lives. Two of them died and the third was critically injured, officials said. Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani asked authorities to investigate the causes of the fire and take steps to prevent another such tragedy. The Kurdish governmen said Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki issued his condolences and offered to help deal with the tragedy. Salih also ordered an immediate review of fire safety measures at all public buildings in the city and the Kurdish region. The Kurdish Regional Government is working closely with the embassies and consulates to inform the next of kin and to work out repatriation issues.
It's the biggest milestone yet for the aircraft affectionately known as the "Queen of the Skies." The 1,500th Boeing 747 has been delivered to German carrier Lufthansa -- a figure unsurpassed by any other wide-bodied plane. To celebrate, the plane was greeted with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and given a special logo in honor of its status. History of an icon The revolutionary jet is beloved not only for its mammoth size and recognizable shape, but for the way it's influenced the aviation industry during a five-decade career. After debuting in 1969 at the Paris Air Show, it opened up air travel to millions of passengers previously unable to afford taking to the skies. Able to fly longer and carry twice as many passengers as its ancestor, the 707, the plane's arrival led to a drop in ticket prices and ushered in a new era of mass tourism. Tom Ballantyne, aviation journalist and chief correspondent at Orient Aviation magazine, said the 747 also heralded a new standard for in-flight comfort. "And let's not forget the freighter version also changed the air cargo scene, allowing air transport to move large items and freight in bulk it had not been able to handle previously," he told CNN. The 747's milestone comes as the aviation market is shifting away from jumbo jets. Many airlines now prefer to run medium-sized twin-engine planes -- such as the Boeing 777 or Airbus A330 -- on more frequent timetables than operate four-engine double-decker jets. The smaller planes seat fewer passengers but cover the same distances and need less fuel. Japanese carrier ANA made headlines earlier this year when it retired its last two 747s for economic reasons, despite the airline's professed emotional ties to the aircraft. Biggest fan Lufthansa remains one of the few champions of the new Intercontinental, as its newest incarnation, the 747-8, is known. Only four other airlines had taken orders of the 747-8 as of February 2014, according to the New York Times. "Lufthansa is honored that the 1,500th 747 will fly with the Lufthansa livery," the airline's executive vice president, Nico Buchholz, said in a statement. The 1,500th plane is the Frankfurt-based airline's 14th 747-8 Intercontinental. Lufthansa has 19 more still on order.
or not discussed in detail -- within the 656 pages of Clinton's "Hard Choices." Hillary Clinton by the numbers 1. Gossip: Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates used his tell-all memoir "Duty" earlier this year to blast many of his former colleagues. He wrote that Vice President Joe Biden "has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades" and described President Barack Obama's administration as distrustful and suspicious of military leaders. The book was a way for the oft-subdued Gates to settle a few scores with Washington as he left to take over the Boy Scouts of America. Clinton's book is not at all like that. It is careful, measured and thoroughly devoid of backbiting. Sure, Clinton describes Russian President Vladimir Putin as a "thin-skinned and autocratic" and former Chinese President Hu Jintao as an "aloof chairman of the board," but most of the time Clinton describes people in more diplomatic, less derisive terms. Putin on Clinton: 'It's better not to argue with women' Instead of a tell-all, Clinton's book serves as a tome to diplomacy. She sums this up in her chapter on Iran in which she writes, "Engagement and pressure. Carrots and sticks. This is the nature of diplomacy." And she sums up the lack of gossip in the book's "Author's Note," which was released weeks before the book came out. "While my views and experiences will surely be scrutinized by followers of Washington's long-running soap opera -- who took what side, who opposed whom, who was up and who was down -- I didn't write the book for them." 2. Keystone XL pipeline: Zero. That's the number of times Clinton writes about the controversial pipeline, a 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. The pipeline has been a hot button issue since it was first proposed in 2008 and more recently as Obama and current Secretary of State John Kerry mull whether to approve the project. Effort to approve Keystone collapses in the Senate Republicans have seized on the issue and have hammered Democrats for not approving what they argue is a way to stimulate jobs. Environmental groups contend that the pipeline would be harmful for the environment and just deepen the United States' dependence on fossil fuels. Though Clinton devotes a chapter of her book to energy and jobs and another to climate change, the pipeline goes unmentioned in both. Clinton writes in a chapter titled "Climate Change: We're All In This Together" that "America's ability to lead in this setting hinges on what we ourselves are willing to do at home" "The problems posed by global warming were evident, despite the deniers," Clinton notes. "There was a mountain of overwhelming scientific data about the damaging effects of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases." Clinton has been hesitant to talk about Keystone since she left State. At a March event in Vancouver, Clinton declined to comment on the ongoing debate over the pipeline because she said it would be unfair to Kerry, who is currently handling the Keystone question. "She said it just wouldn't be appropriate to comment. She choose her words really carefully," said Iain Black, the organizer who introduced Clinton at the closed-to-the-press event. Clinton's State Department was tasked with overeeing whether to approve the pipeline and in a 2010 speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, Clinton said she was "inclined" to approve it, according to the Washington Post. 3. NSA and Edward Snowden: Clinton gets into very little depth when it comes to Edward Snowden, the former contractor at the National Security Agency who obtained and helped publish troves of documents that have shed light and raised questions about U.S. surveillance practices. Snowden and the NSA have been one of the biggest national security issues over the last  year, but in her memoir, Clinton devotes only a few pages to the debate and mentions Snowden only three times. "His leaks revealed some of America's most sensitive classified intelligence programs," Clinton writes before discussing what Snowden revealed and some of the questions he raised. After a few paragraphs, though, Clinton finds herself somewhere between liberty and security and without answering a number of those questions on domestic surveillance. "With liberty and security, it's not that the more you have of one, the less you have of the other. In fact I believe they make each other possible," Clinton concludes. "Without security, liberty is fragile. Without liberty, security is oppressive. The challenge is finding the proper measure: enough security to safeguard our freedoms, but not so much (or so little) as to endanger them." A year after Snowden, the real costs of NSA surveillance 4. Boko Haram: In the weeks before the book's release, the Clinton State Department's failure to designate the tribal group that captured more than 200 schoolgirls in April as a terrorist organization was big news. On Clinton's watch, the State Department -- at the urging of a number of experts on Nigeria and Boko Haram -- decided not to list the group as a foreign terrorist organization, but Kerry, her successor, designated the group as a terrorist organization in November 2013. Republicans seized on Clinton's decision, especially after a Daily Beast article raised the issue. But Clinton only mentions Nigeria once and never mentions Boko Haram. She notes, in a short story about Nigeria, that "corruption was the major impediment to growth in most of Africa," including Nigeria, but doesn't mention the terrorism that has ravaged the oil-rich nation's eastern territories. The omission is noteworthy because Clinton has made extensive comments about Boko Haram since May. How national Republicans plan to talk about Clinton's book 5. Any more certainty on 2016: Clinton waits 595 pages until she references the possibility that she will run for president in 2016 and then only repeats how she commonly answers the question. "Will I run for president in 2016?" she asks. "The answer is, I haven't decided yet." "Right now I believe we should be focused on the work to be done in our country that can't wait until 2016." She then writes about a walk that she and Bill Clinton took where they talked about the future. "We both know I have a big decision in front of me," Clinton writes. "Ultimately, what happens in 2016 should be about what kind of future Americans want for themselves and their children-and grandchildren. I hope we choose inclusive politics and a common purpose to unleash the creativity, potential, and opportunity that makes America exceptional. That's what all Americans deserve." Clinton became more open to talking about 2016 as her book's release date neared. While in January 2013 she told a questioner that she was "not thinking about anything like that right now," she told People Magazine earlier this month that she knows she has "a decision to make."

Drilling has begun as part of an effort to reach the 33 miners who have been trapped underground in Chile for more than three weeks, authorities said Tuesday. The effort to drill through more than 2,300 feet (700 meters) of rock and safely extract the workers could take three to four months, officials said. The hole under way is the excavation hole, where the drill bit will be placed. The miners have been stuck in the desert copper-and-gold mine since an August 5 cave-in and are surviving on supplies funneled to them from above ground through three bore holes, each about 4 inches in diameter. A second 25-minute video sent Tuesday by the miners held another round of greetings to their relatives, family members who had seen it told CNN. Copies were to be distributed to the news media Wednesday. Some relatives emerged from a private screening held in the tents that comprise Camp Hope at the entrance to the mine solemn-faced; others were teary; yet most appeared happy. All the family members said the miners appeared to be in much better condition, much cleaner and much better organized than they appeared during the first video, which was sent up last Thursday. Most appeared stripped to the waist and bearded in the first video; some had shaved and were modeling high-tech sportswear -- T-shirts and shorts -- that were sent down to them this week. The video showed the miners with photographs their relatives have sent down to them in recent days. Some of the miners could be heard playing music in the background. A song from Dominican merengue artist Juan Luis Guerra was one. Over the last few days, rescuers have sent the miners MP3 players and small speakers with a selection of music including Mexican rancheras, Puerto Rican reggaeton and Dominican merengue. Eighteen-year-old Scarlet Sepulveda came out of the meeting crying. "My dad is fine, he's fine, but I miss him a lot," said the daughter of Mario Sepulveda, who held the camera and narrated Thursday's video. "Of course I miss him." Cristina Nunez, wife of Claudio Yanez, came out beaming. "They're much better; they're cracking jokes; they have their own things; and they're good," she said. "I was very happy to see them." Jose Vega, the 70-year-old father of Richard Alex Vega, himself a veteran miner, said of his son, "I was a little worried because I didn't see him much in the video. I think, if they have a problem, they steer clear of the video. But then again, he's a bit like me. He doesn't like cameras too much." The camera, just two inches wide, fits easily through the 4-inch bore hole, has front and side views and can rotate 360 degrees, said Jim Lozano, a product manager with a Fresno, California-based subsidiary of Aries Industries, Inc. "It's able to get into very small openings," he said. He said it was designed for use in the water-well industry. On Tuesday, the miners' menu included tea, herbal infusions, a yogurt-and-cereal shake for breakfast, chicken sandwiches for lunch, kiwi at midafternoon and jam sandwiches for the evening meal. In all, the day's meals contain 2,000 calories. In addition, each man is being urged to drink about five liters of water per day. Wednesday's menu will include rice and shredded beef or pork, the first hot meal the men will have had since they became trapped nearly a month ago, said Jorge Diaz, a medic involved in the miners' care. Though the dishes are normally served with beans in Chile, Diaz said they would not be included, so that the men -- who are living in close quarters -- can avoid getting intestinal gas. Two of the 16 smokers were to get nicotine patches. One of the men reported feeling withdrawal symptoms from not being able to smoke, the other one said he couldn't sleep without having a smoke. Reading material will include press clips about the rescue effort, copies of the "Condorito" cartoon books that are popular in Latin America, and a self-help book entitled "Tactics for Public Speaking." The book was selected after the miners said they wanted to be able to speak eloquently to the news media when they are rescued. Meanwhile, a four-person team from NASA is set to arrive in Chile this week to help provide physical and behavioral health support to the miners. A medical official, a nutritional medic, a psychologist and an engineering expert in logistics from NASA will stay at the mine from Wednesday through Friday to help, Chilean Health Minister Jaime Manalich said. A group of engineers has said it has a "Plan B" that could halve the time it would take to reach the miners. Walter Herrera, quality control and risk manager for the Chilean mining company GeoTech, has said his company was bringing a specialized device typically used for boring water holes to the mine. The drill would use one of the three bore holes already made as a pilot and widen the diameter to about 28 inches, which officials have said is wide enough for the miners to be hoisted through. Chile's mining minister has not ruled out the alternative plan, but has cautioned it might not work. He has also said it might not be put into operation.

 A state-run Chinese newspaper expressed relief Monday that senior Japanese officials had dismissed the country's air force chief after he denied Japan's aggression before and during World War II. General Toshio Tamogami Gen. Toshio Tamogami lost his job as chief of staff for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force, the Ministry of Defense said, after saying in an essay that "it is certainly a false accusation to say that our country was an aggressor nation." Japanese troops invaded China in 1937 and were widely accused of gross human rights abuses, including raping tens of thousands of girls and women and killing several hundred thousand others in what has come to be called "The Rape of Nanking." Imperial Japan also invaded several other Asian nations, leading to the death and misery for an untold number. Two former Japanese prime ministers have apologized for Japanese aggression before and during World War II. Yet China has long accused of elements within Japan of trying to whitewash the Japanese atrocities committed before and during World War II. "The denial of the aggression history by Toshio Tamogami comes in as an element of disharmony," the state-run China Daily said a commentary Monday. "Yet, as long as the Japanese government has a right attitude to this question, the smooth development of ties between the two neighbors will not be derailed by such discordant notes." Tamogami's essay, published late last week, also stirred controversy in South Korea. Japan controlled Korea from 1910 to 1945. Its military is accused of forcing roughly 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, to serve as sex slaves -- they were known euphemistically as "comfort women" -- for soldiers in the Imperial Army. The South Korean foreign ministry criticized Tamogami's commentary in a statement published by Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. "His claim is distorting history," the statement said. "International friendly relations are based on repentance for past wrongdoings and learning a lesson from history," Tamogami's essay won first prize in a competition called the "True Perspective of Modern and Contemporary History." Several Japanese leaders have apologized in recent years for past Japanese aggression. In 2005, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi apologized for his country's role in World War II on the 60th anniversary of the war's end. He vowed Japan would never again take "the path to war." Japan agreed to surrender on August 15, 1945, after U.S. planes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The formal surrender was signed September 2. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama also expressed Tokyo's deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the damage and suffering it inflicted on its Asian neighbors. And in 2001, Koizumi apologized for Japanese treatment of Koreans during its occupation of the Korean peninsula during the first half of the 20th century. In a statement, Koizumi acknowledged the "enormous damage" inflicted by Japan's military "by colonization and invasion" during the conflict. "We must take this historical fact of such very sincerely, and I would like to express keen remorse and heartfelt apologies," Koizumi said. "I would like to also express our deep condolences to the victims inside and outside of Japan during World War II." At the height of the conflict, much of southeast Asia, China and the Pacific islands were in Japanese hands.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged the leaders of Madagascar to resolve their differences after an anti-government rally a day earlier turned violent and left more than two dozen people dead. Protesters rally Saturday before violence broke out near the Presidential Palace. In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Ban deplored the violence and called Sunday on authorities "to urgently initiate a fair process by which those responsible will be brought to justice." Ban also blamed the "tragedy" on a "lack of restraint on all sides." "The Secretary-General calls upon all concerned parties to resolve their differences through peaceful and democratic means and through the exercise of responsible leadership," according to the statement. A police official said the death toll from Saturday's violence outside the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Antananarivo had risen to 26. More than 80 were injured during the demonstration, officials said. The capital city was quiet as mourners attended a public ceremony for the dead. The violence stemmed from an ongoing dispute over who is in charge of the government. Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of Antananarivo, took to the streets one week ago, declaring himself the Indian Ocean island nation's leader after a week of violence and looting that killed at least 80 people and wounded more than 300.  Watch an iReport on the Madagascar violence » But President Marc Ravalomanana has fired him and put someone else in the mayoral job. Rajoelina had called the rally to unveil his new government at the May 13th Plaza, according to Brittany Martin, an American citizen who is a Harvard Fellow and lives in Antananarivo. Martin said the rally was peaceful in the morning hours of Saturday, until gunshots rang out in the afternoon after the protesters marched from the plaza to the palace. She said it was unclear where the shots were coming from. Some media reports blamed foreign mercenaries for the shootings; others said army guards were responsible or that the army was firing at the mercenaries to protect the crowd. Violence in Madagascar began January 26, when protesters stormed state-run television and radio stations in Antananarivo. Hours earlier, the government had shut down a radio station owned by Rajoelina and, weeks ago, had similarly shut down Rajoelina's television station after it aired an interview with ex-President Didier Ratsiraka.  See pictures from last week's upheaval » Ravalomanana took power in 2001 after ousting Ratsiraka in a tense, hotly contested election. Ratsiraka fled to France afterward. Loyalists blame Ratsiraka's family members for inciting the recent trouble. Anger has risen in Madagascar, where the World Bank says the average person earns about $320 a year, over reports that Ravalomanana recently bought a $60 million airplane. Rajoelina has urged supporters to demand the resignation of Ravalomanana and said he planned to take charge until a transition government could be established in the nation off Africa's southeastern coast. Map » "What we've been pushing for is dialogue the whole time," said Rodney Ford, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. He said he had received reports that palace guards used tear gas and shot into the air to try and disperse the crowd.

Park Ji-Sung's Manchester United return has been put on hold after the South Korean midfielder suffered an injury in training. The English Premier League leaders had been without the 29-year-old for the past six weeks while he was at the Asian Cup in Qatar, and he now faces another month on the sidelines. Park injured a hamstring injury on Friday ahead of the Manchester derby, and will now miss United's European Champions League last-16 clash with Marseille in France on February 23. "It was very unfortunate because it was his last kick of the ball in training," team manager Alex Ferguson told the club's website on Tuesday. Has Rooney joined the ranks of football's immortals? "We were really looking forward to having him back after being away for a month at the Asian Cup. He'll be out for up to a month, which is a blow to us." The winger has not played for the English Premier League leaders since the 2-0 win over Sunderland on December 26. Park was part of the South Korea squad which reached the semifinals of January's Asian Cup before losing to eventual champions Japan. The former PSV Eindhoven star announced his international retirement after the tournament, citing a persistent right-knee injury as one of the reasons for his decision. Park will also miss Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round match with non-league minnows Crawley Town as well as Premier League trips to Wigan, Chelsea and Liverpool, but may be back in time for the second leg against the French champions on March 15. Cup magic shared by cross-channel minnows Crawley and Chambery In better news for United, Ecuador winger Antonio Valencia is back in training after breaking his ankle in a Champions League match against Scottish side Rangers in September. "Valencia started training with the reserves on Saturday," Ferguson said. "So he's on his way back and that will be a real boost to have him available for the run-in." Valencia signed from Wigan for a reported $27 million in July 2009. The 25-year-old was a regular as United finished second behind Chelsea, but has made only two league appearances this season.
Actor Andrew Koenig, who had been missing since February 14, committed suicide, his father told reporters after his son's body was found Thursday in a park in Vancouver, British Columbia. "My son took his own life," Walter Koenig said at a news conference in the park. The body of the former "Growing Pains" star was found by several friends who conducted their own search of Stanley Park, where Andrew Koenig liked to walk, his father said. Koenig, 41, was reported missing by his parents after he did not board a flight to Los Angeles from Vancouver last week. Walter Koenig -- himself an actor, known for his role as Pavel Chekov in the "Star Trek" series -- flew to Vancouver with his wife, Judy, on Tuesday to help with the search. "He was obviously in a lot of pain," Walter Koenig said. The Koenigs said they received a letter from their son last week in which he wrote in a "despondent tone." He had stopped taking medication for depression about a year ago, his father said. Unknown to his parents at the time, Andrew Koenig sold or gave away many of his possessions and moved out of his apartment in Venice, California, before traveling to Canada, the family said. Walter Koenig was helping the friends "get another sweep of Stanley Park" Thursday morning and was nearby when they found his son, he said. Koenig asked others who may be considering suicide "before you make that final decision, check it out again, and talk to someone." "If you're one of those people who can't handle it anymore, you know, if you can learn anything from this, there are people out there who really care," he said. "You may not think so and ultimately it may not be enough, but there are people who really care." Families of those who are troubled should not ignore the warning signs, he said. "Don't ignore it, don't rationalize it," he said. Andrew Koenig's mother, Judy Koenig, said people who are depressed "don't realize there is help and they need help." She said they should "connect with each other if there's something that's bothering you." Andrew Koenig had many people who loved him, but "in his pain, he didn't realize it was available to him," she said. Koenig fell in love with Vancouver in 1988 when he first visited to film an episode of the TV show "21 Jump Street," his father said. Koenig appeared in 25 episodes of "Growing Pains" from 1985 to 1989, playing Richard "Boner" Stabone, according to a filmography posted on the Internet Movie Database Web site. He also appeared in episodes of several other television shows. He was described as "a gifted and passionate multitalented young man" on his father's Web site. He performed at The Improv and had roles in movies that included "NonSeNse," "InAlienable," "The Theory of Everything" and "Batman: Dead End." He also acted on television in "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," "G.I. Joe," "My Two Dads," "21 Jump Street," "My Sister Sam" and "Adam-12," the Web site said, and edited, directed, produced and wrote a number of films. Koenig was an activist interested in many causes, his father's Web site says. He was arrested at the Rose Bowl in 2008 while protesting U.S. involvement in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in China. He opposed U.S. participation because of China's support for a repressive regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma, the Web site says.
A municipal police officer was shot and killed late Thursday while standing guard at a local government booth inside a mall in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, police said Friday. The officer was gunned down by three people who were trying to rob the booth, which is a place where local residents can pay their annual homeowners tax, municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. "As of right now, we do not believe this had anything to do with the ongoing drug violence in the city," he said. "The suspects were detained and are being processed." Photos from the scene taken just after the officer was shot showed mall patrons running for cover. The gunmen ran away, but police caught them, local journalist Arturo Chacon said. Also, around 4 a.m. Friday, a man who was being chased by gunmen in several cars drove to a municipal police station in Juarez looking for help, Sanchez said, leading to a 15-minute gunfight. "It would be wrong to say the attack was on the police officers," he said. "An injured man looking for help was being chased, and he came to us. That's when we encountered the gun battle." No officers were injured, and the shooters fled. Since October 2010, at least 26 municipal police officers have been killed in Ciudad Juarez, Sanchez said. Local journalist Arturo Chacon contributed to this report.

In some ways, Douglas -- who was born Dorothy Smith -- was a natural for the role. She was from a small town, Pride, Louisiana, and was a genuine tomboy. Her official website says she spent her childhood "climbing trees, swinging on vines (and) playing football, basketball, and softball with her older brother and all her boy cousins." She also loved animals, a character trait she indulged on the show. A beauty queen, she moved to New York in the late '50s and attracted attention as a model and for her appearances as Perry Como's "Letters Girl." She had some small roles in films and bigger ones on TV series, including a memorable "Twilight Zone" episode, "Eye of the Beholder." But it was "The Beverly Hillbillies" that made her a star. At its peak in the early '60s, the show was the most popular on television, drawing stratospheric ratings seldom equaled by episodic television, despite criticism from reviewers who disliked its broad humor. In fact, a number of 1964 episodes still rank among the most-watched TV shows (non-Super Bowl division) of all time. However, Douglas found it hard to break away from Elly May. Her only starring movie role was in "Frankie and Johnny," a 1966 Elvis Presley vehicle. She and the King did become friendly, bonding over a shared interest in spiritual subjects, according to a website dedicated to Presley's female co-stars. Douglas worked sporadically after "Hillbillies" was canceled in 1971, with the Internet Movie Database listing roles in "Night Gallery," "Love, American Style" and "Adam-12," among others. But she mainly devoted herself to singing and personal appearances. However, she never regretted her claim to fame. "Today the role of Elly May has been a beautiful opportunity, a wonderful little door opener for me to share my heart with others, whether speaking in churches, ladies conferences, youth groups, schools, conventions, and various civic organizations, or one on one," her website bio said. "Amazing what God can do with a life, if given the opportunity!" Douglas was married twice and is survived by a son, Danny Bourgeois.

McLaren's Lewis Hamilton has apologized for causing a collision with Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi which ended the Briton's involvement in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. The 2008 world champion Hamilton overtook the Sauber racer on the 13th lap heading into the corner known as Les Combes, but the 26-year-old failed to see Kobayashi making a counter move. The two cars subsequently made contact with Hamilton spinning into the barriers and out of the race. The crash prompted the Briton  to apologize to Kobayashi and his McLaren team via the social-networking site Twitter. "After watching the replay, I realize it was my fault today [Sunday] 100%. I didn't give Kobayashi enough room though I thought I was past," tweeted Hamilton. 20 years of Schumacher: Is his legacy on the line? "Apologies to Kamui and to my team. The team deserves better from me. Best wishes, Lewis." Hamilton's retirement from the Spa race left him fifth in the drivers' standings, 113 points behind the Red Bull of championship leader Sebastian Vettel. Vettel, who claimed the world title in 2010, took the checkered flag in Belgium ahead of teammate Mark Webber, with Hamilton's McLaren colleague Jenson Button recovering from 13th on the grid to take third position. Button, a world champion in 2009, was pleased with his performance and the condition of his car. "Our car is the best it's been all year, and I feel better than I ever have in Formula 1," the 31-year-old told McLaren's official web site. "We just need to stop the little mistakes from happening so that we can win even more races." Meanwhile, Polish driver Robert Kubica underwent surgery on Sunday for the final time on arm injuries sustained during a pre-season rally crash. Renault driver Kubica crashed out of the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy in February, and was subsequently replaced by German driver Nick Heidfeld for the beginning of the 2011 season. Renault released a statement which said the surgery was a "total success," after the former Sauber driver awoke from the procedure in good spirits. "Robert underwent one last scheduled operation in Italy, aimed at recovering the full mobility of his right elbow," read the statement. "The surgeons are happy to report that they have been able to complete 100% of their task and did not encounter any complications. They have described the outcome of the operation as 'a total success.' "On waking up, it was immediately clear Robert was in good spirits. Why? Well, as soon as he opened his eyes, he asked for the results of today's race! He will now rest in hospital for a few days before resuming his rehabilitation and training program."
The name is already taken, but "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" might be a fitting title for a new interactive view of the Milky Way unveiled this week by the European Southern Observatory. Hundreds of photos taken with a regular digital camera, along with computer crunching, formed this panorama. The 800-million-pixel panorama shows an edge-on view of the plane of our galaxy, complete with points of interests such as the 12-billion-year-old, star-packed globular cluster Omega Centauri and the beautiful, reddish Rosette Nebula. Want to stay closer to home? The panorama also points out familiar landmarks such as Jupiter, noting it's the third-brightest object in our night sky after the moon and Venus. For a bit of a head-rush, you can choose to zoom in and click on "Tour Destinations," which will take you on a trip from one end of the galaxy to another, stopping at your selected point of interest. Users can explore the image in magnificent detail, uncovering millions of individual stars forming a dustlike haze, or superimpose a map of the different constellations in the sky. The beautiful panorama is the first to be released as part of the GigaGalaxy Zoom project, which seeks to "link the sky we can all see with the deep, 'hidden' cosmos that astronomers study on a daily basis," according to ESO. The image is composed of almost 1,200 photos, which were taken by French astrophotographer Serge Brunier with a regular digital camera from ESO observatories at La Silla and Paranal in Chile and from one of the Canary Islands. "I wanted to show a sky that everyone can relate to, with its constellations, its thousands of stars, with names familiar since childhood," Brunier said. The images were then crunched into the single panorama using special software, an effort that took about 340 computing hours to finish, according to the ESO. You can chart your own trip across the Milky Way at GigaGalaxyZoom.org. The next GigaGalaxy Zoom image will be released Monday.
Two men who have been together for 34 years have become the first couple to obtain a same-sex marriage since it became legal in Argentina on July 15. Artistic representative Alejandro Vanelli and actor Ernesto Larrese were married in a civil ceremony Friday morning in Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital. They wore dark suits and striped blue ties and were surrounded by well-wishers and a throng of reporters, photographers and videographers. Larrese spoke to his partner -- but also to the nation at large. "To all those who are afraid ... those who are homophobic ... I tell them, don't worry; this doesn't affect you," Larrese said. "You have nothing to fear. Fear is the opposite of love. Any phobia can be cured with love. There is nothing love cannot cure. "Alejandro, I love you, and I renew my vows to you for 34 more years." They were not the first same-sex couple to be married in the nation; just the first since the federal law was enacted. Previously, Argentina did not have a nationwide law but let state and local governments decide whether to allow same-sex marriages. Alex Freyre and Jose Maria di Bello were married in Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of Argentina, in December. They are believed to be the first same-sex couple to be married in Latin America. Argentina became the first Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage when lawmakers in the Senate passed the bill this month after 14 hours of debate. The bill had already passed the lower chamber of Congress. It gives same-sex couples equal marriage rights, including the ability to adopt children. The law was backed by the center-left government of President Cristina Kirchner, who signed the measure into law. The majority Roman Catholic country joins a few others around the world where same-sex marriage is legal. Among them are the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. Countries in Latin America, a region strongly identified with the Catholic Church, have recently given more attention to gay rights. Mexico City's legislative assembly passed a bill last year legalizing gay marriage there. In September, Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex adoption.

some three and a half times more forceful than Hurricane Katrina -- has created serious food and water shortages. Typhoon Haiyan: 3 days in, little relief for survivors A second round of deaths may be imminent, given limited food and water, along with pools of standing, possibly polluted water amid a breakdown in ordinary sanitation. Relief agencies are worried about outbreaks of disease and infections in the storm's wake. "We don't have the full picture yet, but there is a lot of destruction, which means that next to a high number of deaths the possibility of wounds will be high," said Meinie Nicolai, the president of Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders in Belgium. "We worry about more deaths because of infection." Medecins Sans Frontieres  says in the first stage of its recovery efforts, it will work to keep infection rates down and then work to vaccinate people for tetanus. The bacteria that causes tetanus when it enters a deep flesh wound can be deadly. The agency will also provide ongoing psychological help to the victims of the disaster many of whom will be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Nicolai said. "People in the Philippines are used to typhoons, but the scale of this is completely unprecedented. People will suffer a lot of trauma from the death and destruction they are seeing and will be scared for future typhoons. We will make room for people to speak with a professional and will set up group sessions where people can talk through their trauma." People are so desperate for food and water there are reports of crowds breaking into warehouses and stores. Medical supplies are also scarce. The few hospitals left standing have had to turn people away because they are overwhelmed with the injured. Many people desperate for medical attention have made their way to the airport, where the military is trying to administer medical care. The World Health Organization is supporting the Philippines Department of Health in strengthening its early warning alert and response network to watch for disease outbreaks and other public health threats related to food scarcity, water contamination and other environmental hazards. It is also helping the government coordinate the international assistance to make sure the field hospitals and medical teams and supplies go where there is the most critical need, and is re-establishing bases for the supplies that are coming in from all over the world. USAID, one of the first agencies to reach victims after the typhoon, came with food, water, hygiene kits and sanitation equipment. U.S. Marines have been helping distribute the aid. Americares has an emergency shipment on the way to the Philippines with enough medical aid for 20,000 survivors, including antibiotics, wound care supplies and pain relievers. International Medical Corps has pre-positioned medical supplies and a team on the ground offering support. Direct Relief is also sending 1.5 tons of emergency medicine, which also includes antifungal medications and chronic disease medicines. C-10's are bringing in supplies from the World Food Programme, which has sent high-energy protein biscuits to feed half a million people. The World Food Programme has 10 people on the ground already, and they will be setting up bases and getting information to the rest of the World Food Programme hubs to determine how much food and supplies are needed, said Bill Campbell with the World Food Programme. How Haiyan could teach world how to adapt to extreme weather The government has declared a State of National Calamity, which among other powers gives the government price controls for goods including food. The problem at the moment is being able to assess exactly how many people are hurt.  Geography complicates matters. The Philippines population is spread over 800 of the 7,100 islands that make up the country. "We are having to rent boats and helicopters and are trying to do whatever we can to get to the remote areas," Nicolai said. Medecins Sans Frontieres is one of the hundreds of agencies that has crews on the ground trying to assess survivors' needs; Nicolai spoke as trucks were being loaded outside her office with medical material, tents to create makeshift hospitals, water and sanitation equipment, generators and medical equipment. The good news, if there can be good news in such a disaster, is that the Philippines does have a medical infrastructure already -- at least compared to the other regions in which Medecins Sans Frontieres works, according to Nicolai. "That means you do have an educated medical staff with experience there, but we are learning many are missing or dead, so we, like a lot of other groups that are responding, will try and reinforce and help what is there." How to help Typhoon Haiyan survivors
becoming like a mannequin's, cool and rubbery. Even as the air in her hospital room started to smell more like death than life. "There would be times I'd feel frustrated by the process we were having to go through. And I could just feel Marlise say, 'Mom, don't give up, keep going, keep fighting.' And for many days, that's what I held onto," Machado said. "We tried to raise our children to stand up for what's right, even if you're the only one standing up. And this is what Marlise would have done had the situation been different. She would have stood up for what's right, so we needed to do this for her." A judge in Fort Worth sided with the family on Friday, ordering the hospital to remove any artificial means of life support from Marlise by 5 p.m. Monday. The devices were shut off Sunday morning and her body was released to her husband. "The Muñoz and Machado families will now proceed with the somber task of laying Marlise Muñoz's body to rest, and grieving over the great loss that has been suffered," the family's attorneys said in a statement at the time. "May Marlise Muñoz finally rest in peace, and her family find the strength to complete what has been an unbearably long and arduous journey." Now, the family says they know that Marlise and the baby girl she carried, who they named Nicole, are in heaven. But even the legal victory, which gave them a chance to say their final goodbyes, wasn't a moment for celebration. "It wasn't happy for anybody. There was not a happy ending," Machado said. "We were pleased that the judge ruled in our favor, and that he realized that Marlise was not a patient, as the hospital was saying. That she was, in fact, legally dead." Attorneys: Fetus was 'distinctly abnormal' What happens next? The hospital acknowledged Friday that Marlise had been brain dead since November 28 and that the fetus she carried was not viable. "The past eight weeks have been difficult for the Muñoz family, the caregivers and the entire Tarrant County community, which found itself involved in a sad situation," a hospital statement said over the weekend. "JPS Health Network has followed what we believed were the demands of a state statute." Since the ventilator shut off, Machado said she's finally started to do something she wasn't able to do for months after she knew her daughter was gone: grieve. "For me, closure began after she was disconnected. I was able to get a sense of closure. ... It was hard to start the grieving process when we still had this body that we knew was an empty shell in front of us," she said. "We really couldn't start grieving, but now we can." Erick Muñoz said he doesn't know whether he'll pursue legal action against the hospital. He said he's angry, arguing that the hospital misinterpreted the Texas law and kept his wife's heart beating long after she'd died. And he said if hospital officials send him a bill for her time on a ventilator, there's no way he'll pay it. But it's too soon to say what steps are next. Right now, he's focused on their 15-month-old son. "One of her wishes also was to raise a good man out of my son, and that's what continues to drive me, and what I will use as my driving point for the rest of my life," he said. "Because that's my job now, to raise a good man, because I promised her." The ethics of life support What no one wants to talk about
David Goldman says he can't understand why he can't have custody of his son following his ex-wife's death in Brazil. The U.S. government agrees. David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another childbirth. Goldman told CNN's Larry King he had no idea when he dropped off his wife and 4-year-old son at Newark International Airport in 2004 for a two-week vacation to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that he was about to become embroiled in an international custody battle. Shortly after Bruna Bianchi Goldman arrived in her homeland she called to say she wanted a divorce, which she obtained in Brazil, and would stay there with their son, Sean. The running custody battle has taken many twists and turns and has gained the attention of the Department of State and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "A child belongs with his family, and there is no reason why David Goldman should not get his child back," Clinton said in a recent interview on NBC's Today show. "And we're hoping that that will be resolved very soon. Obviously, if not, we will continue to raise it with the Brazilian government." For nearly five years, Goldman has fought to regain custody of his son. It's a case that has been complicated by Bianchi Goldman remarrying, getting pregnant and dying during childbirth last summer. Sean Goldman is said to be living with his stepfather, who has been granted provisional guardianship. "I went down ... to bring my son home," Goldman said on CNN's Larry King Live Wednesday, figuring his ex-wife's death had made the custody issue a moot point, and "we find out that this man doesn't file custody, but he files to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that they had issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey." Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government. "The Department of State is working diligently to ensure that David and Sean Goldman are accorded their rights under the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil right aspect of International Child Abduction," the agency said in a statement. "We'll continue to insist that the Brazilian government fulfill its obligations under the treaty and international law." The convention, to which Brazil is a signatory, "is a multilateral treaty, which seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return," according to the Hauge Convention Web site. Brazilian courts have refused to return Sean Goldman to the United States for any custody hearings that New Jersey courts have ordered and the Brazilian government has not intervened. As a result, the case remains a stalemate. "I would tell him that he's been very brave, as he has fought to have his son returned to him," Clinton said in the NBC interview. "His son is the most precious person in the world to him and he has gone not just the extra mile, but mile after mile, back and forth, trying to make it clear that his son Sean deserves to be returned to him." But on Larry King Live, Helvecio Ribeiro, a Bianchi family spokesman, questioned Goldman's fitness as a parent. "I don't question the biological right," he said. "The fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent, you have to be more than just a DNA donor, Mr. King. Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you're not there. "And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so," Ribeiro said. Goldman visited his son for the first time in more than four years last month -- a bittersweet experience that was heartbreaking when it was time to return to the United States. "He asked me why I haven't come to see him in all this time," Goldman told Larry King, "and that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. I didn't want to tell him that ... they're holding him." International custody fights are common and were supposed to be simplified by the 1980 Hauge agreement, but conflicting court systems and conflicting accounts of relationships can trump international law. The next step in this case is uncertain.
a cup of tea. This was BJP's "Chai Pe Charcha" (discussion over tea) campaign, where satellite and mobile technologies were used to host live interactions with people. In this flood of online political campaigning, the BJP's strategy has been effective, said Kapil Gupta, founder of OMLogic, an online media agency. "They have hired experts and given them full liberty to manage their social media," he said. "Some campaigns are not just for promotions, but to create conversations." A Facebook tracker designed to show how much users are talking about candidates and parties showed more buzz for the BJP over rivals. But Modi is not the only one as scores of political parties have turned to Facebook interviews, mobile crowd sourcing, or hashtag wars on Twitter. Activist-turned-politician Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party, which made its debut in Delhi assembly elections earlier this year, have been using social media to draw swathes of supporters. The anti-corruption party has a Facebook page for every single constituency in the capital. A study by the Center for Media Studies estimates this year's total election spending to reach $5 billion -- three times higher than the previous elections in 2009. This sum is being compared to the $7 billion that the U.S. spent in its last presidential elections. According to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), political parties are typically spending 2 to 5% of their budget on fueling their online presence. The social media strategy of the ruling Congress Party doesn't appear to be as aggressive. At a time when Twitter has become politicians' latest fighting weapon, both the party president, Sonia Gandhi and her son, Rahul Gandhi, 43, are conspicuous by their absence on the microblogging site. Many of the party members, however, are active tweeters. But one notable campaign by the party has been the wide use of the mobile messaging platform, WhatsApp, both for internal communication and relaying party updates. Google is helping all political parties with their online strategy by organizing weekly hangouts with politicians. In the past, India's political class mostly interacted with the public only through campaign trails, mass rallies and media interviews. The search engine has also developed a dedicated election hub, and a "Pledge to Vote" interactive map. "We wanted to engage with first time voters and inspire different age groups to go out and vote," said Sandeep Menon, director of marketing at Google India. "We have over half a million pledges so far and they are coming from all parts of India." This trend is largely to do with changing voter demographics. Out of the massive electorate, more than 20 million are first timers in the age group of 18 and 19. Will it work? The IAMAI report estimates there could be a vote swing of 3 to 4% in 24 states -- states with significant numbers of Internet users. These could be young men or non-working women who are active social media users. However, a major reason for dissent is India's notoriously weak Internet infrastructure. Most of India's rural belt still lives in an offline world of SMS and faxes. A report by McKinsey found rural Internet penetration to be just one twelfth of urban penetration rates. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, New Delhi-based independent political analyst, says that with the digital divide in India, the impact of online campaigns remains constrained. "Let's not exaggerate the influence of social media to influence Indian society in general, and politics in particular," he said. "One of four people in India has never used the Internet; they are just beginning to use a mobile. The impact, as of now, remains limited largely to urban areas and well-off sections of society." Political parties have tried to get past this hurdle in their campaigns by using mobiles to target the rural voters. The BJP allows potential supporters to SMS their voter registration number to receive voting assistance. The AAP adopted a "missed call" initiative during the Delhi elections and has continued with it in the run up to the national elections. Anyone can register as a party member or a volunteer by simply calling a designated number and hanging up after one ring. Regardless of the reasoned debate around its worth, social media is paving the way for a further "democratization of politics" in the world's biggest democracy, says Gupta. "Earlier, elections in India were governed by either the rich class or the rural poor," he said. "Now, even the middle class is interested, and social media is where they can express their opinion and talk."
before trial and conviction -- a privacy-versus-public-safety dispute that could have wide-reaching implications in the rapidly evolving technology surrounding criminal procedure. At issue in the ruling Monday was whether taking genetic samples from someone held without a warrant in criminal custody for "a serious offense" is an unconstitutional "search." A 5-4 majority of the court concluded it is legitimate, and upheld a state law. "When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment," the majority wrote. Read the court's ruling Law enforcement lauds genetic testing's potential as the "gold standard" of reliable evidence gathering, especially to solve "cold cases" involving violent offenders. But privacy rights groups counter the state's "trust us" promise not to abuse the technology does not ease their concerns that someone's biological makeup could soon be applied for a variety of non-criminal purposes. Twenty-six states and the federal government allow genetic swabs to be taken after a felony arrest and without a warrant. Each has different procedures, but in all cases, only a profile is created. About 13 individual markers out of some 3 billion are isolated from a suspect's DNA. That selective information does not reveal the full genetic makeup of a person and, officials stress, nothing is shared with any other public or private party, including any medical diagnostics. The Obama administration has signaled its support. Read a summary of major upcoming decisions The case involves a Maryland man convicted of a 2003 rape in Wicomico County in the state's Eastern Shore region. Alonzo King Jr. had been arrested four years ago on an unrelated assault charge, and a biological sample was automatically obtained at that time. That sample was linked to the earlier sexual assault. King moved to suppress that evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, but was ultimately convicted of the 2003 first-degree rape offense and was given a life sentence. The Fourth Amendment grants the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." Both King and his legal team turned down CNN's request for an interview. A divided Maryland Court of Appeals later agreed with King, saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon, outweighing the state's law enforcement interests. That court also said obtaining King's DNA immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him, and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting. But the high court decided in favor of the state. Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, and Samuel Alito. The issue of citizen privacy has been particularly acute since the 9/11 attacks. Federal and state governments have stepped up surveillance of suspected terrorists and their allies and of high-risk targets, like government buildings and shopping malls. The current conservative-majority court has generally been supportive of law enforcement in recent search and privacy disputes, but not always. The court last year ruled police could not place a GPS tracking device on a drug suspect's car for several weeks without first obtaining a search warrant. In a sharply worded dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority's reasoning established a "terrifying principle." "The court's opinion barely mentions the crucial fact about this case: the search here was entirely suspicionless. The police had no reason to believe King's DNA would link him to any crime." Scalia added the state law "manages to burden uniquely the sole group for whom the Fourth Amendment's protections ought to be most jealously guarded: people who are innocent of the state's accusations," describing of the legal concept of innocent until proven guilty. He was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Scalia's prior support of Fourth Amendment protections is well-documented, so his siding with three more liberal members of the court was not surprising. A 1994 federal law created a national database in which local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies can compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons, but courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed. In a brief filed by 49 states supporting Maryland, officials also said the information is secure, and retested when an initial "hit" is identified. After a warrant is issued for probable cause, another fresh DNA sample is taken and it is that test that is used to ultimately prosecute in court. Each initial test costs about $30. The Fourth Amendment requires the government to balance legitimate law enforcement interests with the privacy rights of individuals. A key area of concern in the high court was whether developing "Rapid DNA" technology would allow initial identification testing to be completed within about two hours. Currently it can take two weeks or more, depending on backlogs. Civil liberties groups worry inadequate testing by overwhelmed lab technicians can lead to errors, such as the one that sent Dwayne Jackson to prison for armed robbery. It was three years before a lab mistake was noticed, and the Nevada man was freed as an innocent man. DNA -- Deoxyribonucleic acid -- is a coded molecule providing a genetic map for the development of all known living organisms. By 2000, all 50 states and the federal government required DNA collection from convicted offenders, and that was soon expanded by many jurisdiction to criminal arrests. The number of offender profiles in federal Combined DNA Index System is now about 10 million, with more than a million arrestee profiles. Congress in December passed the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act, a grant program to help states pay for the expanded system. The 22-year-old woman was murdered in 2003, but her killer was not identified until three years later, after his conviction for another crime, when his DNA matched cold-case evidence found under the victim's fingernails. Her mother, Jayann Sepich, personally lobbied lawmakers for months to ensure passage. President Obama signed the bill earlier this year. "It's the right thing to do," he said in 2010, of expanding DNA swabs for arrestees. "This is where the national registry becomes so important." The case is Maryland v. King (12-207).

supported by U.S. fighter jets -- dropped 3,804 gallons of fresh drinking water and 16,128 ready-to-eat meals, the military said. But a United Nations official said airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops aren't enough for the estimated 40,000 minority Yazidis, who are trapped on Mount Sinjar and hiding from ISIS fighters who have said they will kill the group. Only about 100 to 150 people a day have been able to be airlifted by Iraqi security forces off the mountain, said Marizio Babille of UNICEF. "We are running out of time for thousands who can obviously not be reached by these airdrops," he said, adding that UNICEF is appealing for the international support to open and secure "a humanitarian corridor over land." Dozens, including 60 children, according to UNICEF have died on the mountain where the Yazidis are battling extreme temperatures and a lack of food and water. American planes also have twice dropped food and other supplies to thousands of Yazidis, members of a minority group that fled to a northern Iraqi mountain after ISIS militants overran their town, Obama said Saturday. U.S. aircraft are poised to strike ISIS militants who have surrounded the mountain, Obama said. Any such strikes would support Kurdish forces' efforts to free the Yazidis, he said. The airstrikes have ramped up America's involvement in Iraq where ISIS is seizing control of towns and key infrastructure even as it celebrates its own slaughter along the way. The United States has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq, including advisers sent in recent weeks to coordinate with Iraqi and Kurdish military officials in response to the ISIS rampage. The USS George H.W. Bush and other Navy ships also are in the region. Obama indicated Saturday the United States' interests in targeting ISIS went well beyond protecting U.S. personnel and Iraqi minorities. "My team has been vigilant ... about foreign fighters and jihadists gathering in Syria and now Iraq, who might potentially launch attacks outside of the region against Western targets and U.S. targets," he said. "So there's going to be a counterterrorism element that we are already preparing for and have been working diligently on for a long time now." Obama: Iraq's ethnic groups need to unite Asked Saturday if Obama felt ISIS had been underestimated, the President said the advance of the Sunni Islamic extremists has been "more rapid" than intelligence officials and policymakers, both inside and outside Iraq, had predicted. But he said ISIS' advance was made possible in part by the lack of an inclusive and functioning Iraqi government. The government forces, "when they (were) far away from Baghdad, did not have the incentive or the capacity to hold ground against an aggressive adversary," Obama said. To secure their country, Iraqis will need to build an inclusive government, Obama said, in an apparent dig at Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government. Iraq's Sunni minority have bitterly complained of being marginalized and cut out of the political process by al-Maliki's government. The height of that marginalization coincided with months of deadly sectarian fighting throughout the country, and preceded ISIS' rout of Iraqi security forces in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, earlier this year. Michael Rubin, a Middle East analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, cautioned Saturday that even if al-Maliki's government would have been more inclusive, ISIS still would have been a problem. "No matter how magnanimous Maliki could have been in an ideal world, it would have meant nothing to ISIS, many of whose members aren't even Iraqi. Sometimes there's no magic diplomatic formula," Rubin, a Pentagon official under former President George W. Bush, told CNN. One unanswered question, according to James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to 2012, is what the United States would do if the Iraqi government and moderate elements can't muster the political and military capability to take on ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Map: Where is ISIS? Militants using U.S.-made weapons Even as the airstrikes were under way, there was news that ISIS militants captured Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, just north of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. According to a senior Kurdish official, the militant fighters have been using U.S.-made weapons seized during fighting from the Iraqi army, including M1 Abrams tanks. There had been conflicting reports about who controlled the dam on the Tigris River, with heavy fighting under way between ISIS fighters and Kurdish forces, known as Peshmerga. U.S. officials have warned that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to Baghdad. In other fighting, an Iraqi airstrike killed 45 ISIS fighters and injured 60 Friday in the northern town of Sinjar, the country's state-run National Media Center said. ISIS militants have executed people who don't share their fanatical interpretation of Sunni Islam.  The group posts videos of its savagery to the Internet. One shows a Christian man forced to his knees, surrounded by masked militants, identified in the video as members of ISIS. They force the man at gunpoint to "convert" to Islam. Then, the group beheads him. Another shows ISIS militants placing severed heads on spikes to strike terror in the population.
The Rhode Island school superintendent who last week fired all the teachers and staff from a school whose students were performing poorly said Wednesday she is willing to negotiate now that the union has agreed to support changes. "It is with great excitement that I read the press release from the Central Falls Teachers' Union referencing their proposed comprehensive reform agenda," said Central Falls Schools Superintendent Frances Gallo in a news release. "It so closely mirrors my requests for assurances that I am pleased to reassure the union their place in the planning process. I do so with the belief that everyone has come to understand the meaning of comprehensive school reform." Gallo added the school district will press ahead with its plan for improving Central Falls High School. In a written statement, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the union was pleased that Gallo has agreed to go back to the table. "The dedicated teachers and staff want nothing more than to continue and improve upon the progress they have made," Weingarten said. "Real, sustainable change will only happen when all stakeholders work together." Gallo's statement came a day after the Central Fall Teachers Union recommended a number of changes, including increasing instructional time for students, enhancing their support and increasing teaching quality. Last week, the school board approved Gallo's plan to discharge 93 people -- classroom teachers, administrators and other personnel -- at the high school. The school is in a low-income area, and many of its students are Latino with English as their second language. The firings, which were to have become effective at the end of the school year, came after the district failed to reach an agreement with the teachers' union on a plan for teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores. A union spokesman said the firings were drastic and cited a 21 percent rise in reading scores and a 3 percent hike in math scores in the past two years. Another official also pointed to progress at the school. But Rhode Island's Education Commissioner Deborah Gist defended the mass firings, calling them "many years in coming." Gist pointed out that the school's graduation rate is 48 percent, and "only 7 percent of the students are proficient in mathematics." "More than half of the ninth-graders are failing more than two classes, which is an indication that they are frustrated, and what we know about student achievement, when students aren't successful in their class, they're much more likely to drop out of school," Gist said. In remarks Monday to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, President Obama appeared to express support for the firings. "If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year, if it doesn't show signs of improvement, then there's got to be a sense of accountability," he said. "And that's what happened in Rhode Island last week at a chronically troubled school, when just 7 percent of 11th graders passed state math tests -- 7 percent." The AFT said Obama's comments "do not reflect the reality on the ground and completely ignore the teachers' significant commitment to working with others to transform this school."
President Obama appeared at two recent fundraisers with some serious sticker shock. About 200 people ponied up at least $5,000 per ticket for an event hosted by Ricky Martin. That was followed by a function at a private home where 60 people spent $38,500 each to get through the door. Just last week, Obama -- with George Clooney -- raised $15 million in one night. This makes me wonder how in the hell our political process became so distorted that Obama needs this much money to run for re-election. I thought we were broke? And yet, at the end of March, Obama and his presumed general election opponent, Mitt Romney, had raised nearly a combined $300 million, almost enough to fund Planned Parenthood's annual budget by themselves. Forget Wall Street, it's the campaign trail that needs to be occupied. The median income in the United States is about $50,000, so I doubt very many 99 percenters are able to meet the $75,000 minimum that was expected at a recent Romney fundraiser. Did you know the goal of the RNC is to raise $800 million by November? Imagine how many families could be helped if just half of that was used to train people for the new job market, as opposed to being spent to help one guy get hired? Face it, the president and Romney may have different political and economic views, but they are both propped up by highly affluent power brokers who are expecting big returns for the big checks they are writing. This is why the worst thing to happen to our process was the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows corporations (and unions) to spend unlimited funds to promote a candidate. This is akin to handing the keys of a bakery to the Cookie Monster. These big spenders are not just involved in shaping dialogue. They get involved with shaping policy, which inevitably makes the good of the people secondary to the good of the deepest pockets. We don't just need campaign reform, we need roadblocks to prevent special interest groups from turning the democratic process into more of a sham that it already is. Let the Supreme Court keep its ridiculous ruling, but set a limit on the amount of money candidates can raise and spend on their campaigns. Require all ads and debates to be aired on public television, and then cap the number of hours each party is allowed to use during the general election. By putting it on public television, we stop large media conglomerates from profiting from the process. So, ideally Obama and Romney would both get $10 million and 40 hours of advertisement to state their case. Let's take away the $200 million war chests that Obama has been able to amass in both 2008 and 2012, and force him and future candidates to find a way to persuade the country to vote for them without relying on their ability to outspend their opponent. I know, I know, Romney wouldn't even be in the position he's in without outspending -- and dare I say, bullying -- his opponents. By leveling the economic playing field, our politicians have a chance to return to being representatives of the people, not just the ones who know the right people or make the right promises. Before making the rounds in New York on Monday, President Obama tweeted a sentence from the commencement speech he gave at Barnard College: "Don't just get involved. Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for your seat at the head of the table." He left out the part about needing $5,000 to get in the door so you can even see the table. But I guess those messy details are easy to overlook in a country with an 8.1% unemployment rate, whose leaders still find it appropriate to hold fundraisers for rich people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.
From land, water and air, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen are being deployed in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama is safe. A law enforcement agent looks toward Capitol Hill ahead of the inauguration on Tuesday. "Right now, we have no credible threat that there is any direction of interest on the inauguration," Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan told CNN. FBI agents and intelligence officials have been checking with sources around the United States and the world to make sure no leads are overlooked, and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said intelligence will be scrubbed and rescrubbed right through the inauguration. "We are literally going to be watching this every minute between now and the conclusion of events on the 20th," Chertoff said. Federal officials acknowledge the inauguration of the first African-American U.S. president could be an attractive target. Since Obama's election, the number of threats against him has increased, according to a recent federal intelligence assessment. FBI officials say the number of tips coming in has increased, as is common before an inauguration. Investigations, however, have not uncovered a real threat. The FBI has been especially aggressive in examining white supremacy groups, which have ramped up their anti-Obama comments. "We have not seen any activity by the groups," said FBI Assistant Director Joseph Persichini. "We have seen a lot of chatter, we have seen a lot of discussions, we have seen some information via the Internet. Again, but those are discussions. We look at the vulnerabilities and whether or not the groups are capable of taking on action." Persichini said he believes the bureau has "a good operational plan" for dealing with the groups, but says that right now, there is no evidence they are trying to launch anything.  Watch more on inauguration security » The Secret Service is coordinating security for the inauguration, which will involve 58 federal, state and local agencies. All of them are represented at the Secret Service command center, where they can communicate and work together to respond to any report of a possible problem. Airspace restrictions around the Capitol are being tightened. The U.S. Coast Guard is closing portions of the Potomac River. Miles of roads will be closed, along with most of the bridges into the District of Columbia. Checkpoints are going up, and undercover teams are being deployed to look for suspicious people or vehicles. Explosives-sniffing dogs will be on hand to nose out bombs, and horses trained in crowd control are on duty. Thousands of security cameras are being used to monitor activities, sharpshooters are being stationed, and sensors will be used to detect chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. In addition to Secret Service agents, the security effort will involve 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions, 10,000 National Guardsmen, about 1,000 FBI personnel, and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard are ready to respond if there is an emergency, according to Chertoff. Security planners have drawn up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect. "Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage," he said. A major unknown is how large the crowd will be for Tuesday's activities. Estimates have ranged from 1 million to 2 million. The FBI's Persichini said only that "we know it is going to draw a lot of people here to the nation's capital." Those attending the swearing-in ceremony or entering the parade route will undergo tight screening, including passing through magnetometers. Spectators who are unable to get into those events will be routed to the National Mall, which, for the first time, will be open from end to end for an inauguration. Security there will be less stringent. There has been extensive planning to ensure the crowds can be moved in an orderly and safe way, and to prevent a stampede if there is any kind of security incident. Local and federal agencies have even consulted with a crowd expert. Authorities say the massive security operation is not intended to deter people from coming to Washington. "Our efforts are to make sure people are safe," Secret Service spokesman Malcolm Wiley said. "We'd like for as many people to come as want to come. And again, during our planning, we have made sure we could accommodate however many people decide to come." That inaugural events are spread over a four-day period has made security even more challenging. Organizers say they started their security planning the day after the last inauguration and ramped up their efforts in July. Officials involved say this is the biggest event they have been involved in, but believe they are prepared. "There are a lot of things we all think about, and I'll admit that at 3 in the morning, I might wake up thinking about something, but I have to tell you, I am so confident in this plan," the Secret Service's Sullivan said. "I just don't see any benefit to worry, and I think we just have to go along the way we're going right now and do everything that we can do to make sure that this event is going to be a safe event, that this historical event will be an enjoyable event for everybody and that, quite frankly, that the day isn't about security, but the day is about our president and the day is about our country."
The peculiar standoff on Borneo between Malaysian security forces and a group of men from the southern Philippines has its roots in a recent landmark peace deal between Manila and Muslim rebels, according to an expert on the region. More than 100 men from the mainly Muslim southern Philippines came ashore in the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo early last week demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that has historical claims on the area. Their claims touch on an unresolved territorial question between the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as Manila's efforts to improve relations with Islamic insurgents in the country's south after decades of violence. Malaysian police and armed forces soon surrounded the village in the eastern Sabah district of Lahad Datu where the men had gathered. Police officials said they were negotiating with the group in an effort to persuade its members to return to their homes in the Philippines peacefully. The Philippine government also urged them to come back to the country, saying it hadn't authorized their voyage. There was no indication of a resolution to the standoff on Monday. The men claim to be the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu, which once encompassed Sabah, and say they don't want their people to be sent away from the area, Malaysian authorities said. There are conflicting claims about to what extent the men are armed. Eroded power Over the weekend, comments appeared in the news media from representatives of the sultanate, whose power is now largely symbolic, saying that their followers who had gone to Sabah planned to stay where they were. "Nobody will be sent to the Philippines. Sabah is our home," Jamalul Kiram, a member of the sultanate's ruling family, told reporters in Manila on Sunday, according to Agence France-Presse. The sultanate's claim to Sabah plays a long-standing and important role in the Philippine government's relationship with the country's Muslim minority and with neighboring Malaysia, said Julkipli Wadi, the dean of the Institute of Islamic Studies at the University of the Philippines. Established in the 15th century, the Sultanate of Sulu became an Islamic power center in Southeast Asia that at one point ruled Sabah. But the encroachment of Western colonial powers, followed by the emergence of the Philippines and Malaysia as independent nation states, steadily eroded the sultanate's power, according to Wadi. It became "a sultanate without a kingdom" to rule over, he said. Sulu is now a province within the Republic of the Philippines. But the sultanate has nonetheless retained influence over some people in the southern Philippines and Sabah who still identify themselves with it, according to Wadi. Excluded from a peace deal The members of the sultanate's royal family, although riven by internal disputes over who the rightful sultan is today, appear to have felt isolated by the provisional accord signed in October by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines. Malaysia, a mainly Muslim country, helped facilitate the agreement. Kiram was cited by AFP as saying that the sultanate's exclusion from the deal, which aims to set up a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims, prompted the decision to send the men to Sabah this month. Dispatching the boat loads of followers to Lahad Datu served to make the sultanate's presence felt, according to Wadi. "The whole aim is not to create conflict or initiate war, it is just to position themselves and make governments like Malaysia and the Philippines recognize them," he said. Historical ties The economic, cultural and historical links between Sabah and the nearby Philippines islands, as well as the porous nature of the border between the two, means that many of the Filipino men have friends and relatives in Lahad Datu. But the historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila retaining a "dormant claim" to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu, according to the CIA World Factbook. According to the official Philippine News Agency, Manila still claims much of the eastern part of Sabah, which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1963, Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia, a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal. Malaysia still pays a token rent to the sultanate for the lease of Sabah, according to Wadi.
Umbrellas, yellow ribbons, numbered codewords and tangles of phone cords: these are the distinctive sights of the dramatic protest unfolding beneath Hong Kong's spectacular skyline. Here are some of the defining images to have emerged from the days of pro-democracy protest that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and the reasons behind them. The umbrella The key symbol of the protests that have upended Hong Kong is the humble umbrella. Since it was used to shield protesters from the tear gas and pepper spray deployed by police, the umbrella has become a ubiquitous sight on the frontlines, and given the movement its name. Protesters are bringing in umbrellas in bulk and distributing them for free, sleeping under their shelter and writing slogans on them. Bryan Druzin, an assistant professor of law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the umbrella was not only functional but had "a certain emblematic resonance in that it's a symbol of passive resistance." "Hong Kong is a city that periodically takes refuge under umbrellas against seasonal typhoons that threaten the city. The turmoil is another storm Hong Kong is trying to weather," he said. Hong Kong artist Kacey Wong has been generating protest art by running a social media "competition" to create a lasting logo for "the Umbrella Revolution" (the prizes being "justice, democracy and freedom"). He said the way the umbrella was used brought an "enormous feeling of brotherhood." "Tank Man -- that was one guy standing in front of a tank," says Wong. "The umbrella represents people working with each other to form a defensive shield. If you see a piece of the shield ripped away by the police, it will be replaced by another." It was a strong image with an inherent contrast, he said. "It's a soft thing but it's also very hard in terms of our determination to win this battle." Yellow ribbons Yellow ribbons are tied to barricade railings, pinned on shirts, and decorate social media profiles. Long an emblem of suffrage movements internationally -- particularly tied to women's suffrage -- they have been adopted by Hong Kong's protesters as a symbol of democratic aspiration. "Not everyone can be there on the front lines," says Wong. "The ribbon is a way to show your support." Black tees The student protesters are mostly dressed in black t-shirts. Black has traditionally been worn at the city's annual protests to mark the Tiananmen massacre; Wong says they also represent "sorrow and darkness" regarding the use of force on peaceful demonstrators. Numbers The protest site reads like a telephone directory of numbers, emblazoned on notes and posters plastered around the streets: 689, 926, 8964. They also figure heavily in social media posts about the protests. The numbers are a form of shorthand common to Chinese political culture in Hong Kong and in mainland China, explains Wong. In the mainland, he says, due to censorship, "you have to speak in a curveball way. There's a lot of coded words they use because they cannot express it directly." Although no such censorship exists in Hong Kong, the same political shorthand is commonplace, said Druzin. Dates are often used: #926 refers to September 26, when the protests kicked off, #8964 to the date of the Tiananmen crackdown. Hong Kong chief executive C.Y. Leung, the main target of the protesters' ire, has his own code: 689. It refers to the number of votes he received from Hong Kong's 1,200-strong election committee to rise to office as the territory's leader. "They use it to question his legitimacy because he was voted for by only 689 people in Hong Kong," said Wong. "They call him that to remind people he doesn't represent all of us -- there's 7 million of us here." Protesters devoted a bus in a blockaded area to Leung, plastering it with messages to the chief executive. Above the bus's windshield, the route number was changed to "689," the destination to "Hell." Supplies The protest sites are notably orderly, well-organized and clean. Volunteers hand out free bottled water, snacks, towels and medicine. Bananas are dispensed, as are loaves of breads and saltine crackers. Demonstrators bring carts laden with grocery bags of supplies, which are dispensed for free to whoever needs them. Trash is sorted into three piles for recycling -- plastic, paper and garbage -- and volunteers patrol with plastic garbage bags to collect trash. Homemade protection After Hong Kong protesters were tear gassed on Sunday, many improvised their own protection, using some of the materials circulated by the Occupy Wall Street movement. Solutions included wrapping exposed skin in Saran plastic wrap, or using swimming goggles and plastic ponchos. Charging stations Some people that live close to the protests are offering to let protesters charge their cell phones. They post signs with their contact numbers if people need to use their power supply. Volunteers have brought power strips and extra chargers so protesters can stay connected. Phones have played an invaluable role throughout the protests as information is shared through social media. FireChat Rumors that the cell phone network would be shut down sparked a massive rush in Hong Kong to download the FireChat messaging app. The app allows users to message each other without WiFi or cell data connection. The demand has been so great that Micha Benoliel, the CEO of the U.S. company Open Garden which developed the app, has come out to Hong Kong during the protests. The protesters are well organized and well prepared, said Benoliel. "They knew that at some point the cellular networks would be shut down or just be overloaded by number of people in the same place, so they know that Firechat is a way to remain connected and communicate." With one caveat -- all conversations on FireChat are public because any user can join the messaging rooms. Phones have another use. Candles are long out of vogue as phones are easy, convenient and a non-fire way of providing light in a massive night gathering. Photographed from above, the glowing screens of mobile phones held aloft by the sea of protesters' have created an enduring image of the demonstrators' solidarity. Effigies Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung has been the main target of the protesters' anger, with calls for him to resign circulating among the crowds. A gigantic, enlarged effigy of Leung's head, replete with fangs, has been a distinctive sight on the streets during the protests. Protesters chant in Cantonese, "Step down, step down!" when they see it. Anthem The rousing anthem, "Do you hear the people sing" from the revolution-themed musical "Les Miserables," has been adopted by the protesters. The slogan is painted on a poster hanging from a prominent bridge and has been played by a string quartet on the streets. In the musical, the song is sung as Parisian revolutionaries prepare to rebel against the government.
the medical field is not his field at all." Mai Al-Swayan, who was one of the first Saudi women to sign the online petition, called the comments "ridiculous: " and added, "I am really disappointed. How could somebody ever make such a statement?" Al-Loheidan's words have been ridiculed mercilessly via social media since they were first reported. An Arabic Twitter hashtag called "#WomensDrivingAffectsOvariesAndPelvises" was quickly created to make fun of Al-Loheidan -- underscoring just how widely the call for Saudi women to defy the driving ban has resonated thus far. And while numerous conservative voices have supported Al-Loheidan, many Saudis believe this was an extremely clumsy way of trying to counter the popularity of the October 26 campaign. "I don't think it will harm the campaign -- on the contrary, it will make it stronger," said Saudi columnist and author Abdullah Al-Alami. Since it published online over a week ago, a petition on the website www.oct26driving.com has garnered more than 12,000 signatures from those asking authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to lift a de facto ban than prohibits women from driving. "There is no justification for the Saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so," reads part of the petition. No traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. The new petition also urges the Saudi government to present "to the citizens a valid and legal justification" for the ban, demanding authorities should not simply blame it on "societal consensus." Many supporters of the campaign expressed dismay when reporting the website could no longer be accessed throughout the Kingdom as of Saturday. A post on the Oct26driving.com website read, "Society wanting the ban to be lifted is apparently such a threat that the page petitioning the government to lift the ban has been blocked from within Saudi." Al Alami wondered if the numerous conservatives opposed to women being granted the right to drive may have asked for the site to be blocked. Still, Al-Alami said he isn't too concerned. "The message has been delivered," said Al-Alami. "This is a battle we must fight. There is no U-turn." CNN was unable to reach various Saudi Ministries for comment. The issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been a contentious one. And while such demonstrations are extremely rare, they have been staged at least twice before. In June 2011, dozens of women across Saudi Arabia participated in the "Women2Drive" campaign by driving throughout the streets of their cities. In 1991, a group of 47 women drove through the country's capital city, Riyadh. After being arrested, many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces. In addition to prohibiting driving, the country's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts, working, traveling and going to school without the express permission of their male guardian. Saudi Arabia has been moving toward change under its current ruler, King Abdullah, who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women's rights. In January, he appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, the first time women had been chosen for the country's top consultative body. In 2011, he announced that women can run for office and vote in local elections in 2015, and in 2009, he appointed Saudi Arabia's first female deputy minister.
Consumers should be skeptical of health and weight-loss claims of the increasingly popular Brazilian fruit, acai, and the free trial offers that ask for their credit card information, a nonprofit health group said Monday. Companies selling acai fruits are under investigation after numerous consumer complaints. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said companies offering free trials of diet pills made with the acai berries have bilked thousands of consumers using fake celebrity endorsements and blogs to lure customers. Consumers are asked to provide a credit card to pay shipping and handling charges, but begin almost immediately receiving $80 to $90 monthly charges. Thousands of consumers have had trouble stopping those charges once they canceled the free trial offer. Acai (pronounced a-sigh-EE) comes in a number of forms including juice, pulp, powder and capsule. The berry has been touted as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and an antibacterial. The fruit is said to contain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential to human health. Claims of weight loss are unfounded, said the CSPI. "There's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that acai pills will help shed pounds, flatten tummies, cleanse colon, enhance sexual desire, or perform any of the other commonly advertised functions," according to the organization's press release. Acai's popularity has surged on bogus marketing claims, said Jonny Bowden, a certified nutrition specialist and author of several health books. "Virtually every berry -- blueberry, strawberry, goji, acai -- are anti-inflammatory and high in antioxidants," Bowden said.  "This particular one is exotic. It's found in Brazil. It's been marketed to have more of a magic ingredient. It's been over-hyped and marketed to death. There are claims to curing cancer, curing baldness that is all over the place." Like most berries, acai has good nutritional qualities, but "there is not a drop of research" that supports marketing claims that it prevents weight gain and facial wrinkles, Bowden said. Acai juices sell for as much as $40 per bottle. "The expensive acai berry is triumph of marketing over science, that's the bottom line," Bowden said.  "It's not useless, but it's not anything that people are claiming it is." Companies including FWM Laboratories of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Hollywood, Florida, Advanced Wellness Research of Miami Beach, Florida, and other acai companies are accused of using fake diet blogs to steer consumers to sites plugging the free trials. After a doctor listed acai as a healthy food on the Oprah Winfrey show last year, and a guest on Rachael Ray's cooking show mentioned the fruit, ads popped up directing consumers to sites selling acai weight loss products as if endorsed by the celebrities. Winfrey and Ray have publicly disassociated themselves from those sites. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigating numerous complaints and said a lawsuit against FWM Laboratories is very likely. According to the Better Business Bureau, FWM Laboratories received an F rating, the BBB's worst. Other acai companies with the BBB''s F rating include Advanced Wellness Research, AcaiBurn, FX Supplements and SFL Nutrition. "There are no magical berries from the Brazilian rain forest that cure obesity, only painfully real credit card charges and empty weight loss promises," Blumenthal said. "Aggressive acai berry pitches on the Internet entice countless consumers into free trials promising weight loss, energy and detoxification. These claims are based on folklore, traditional remedies and outright fabrications unproved by real scientific evidence." Keri Gans, dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, recommends that customers turn to fruits and vegetables at their local produce markets. "If you're going on the Internet to find them and paying shipping fees, you should go to a market and buy local vegetables and fruits," she said.  "It'd be a lot less expensive." Acai berries could be part of a well-balanced diet of different fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Gans said consumers should be skeptical whenever any one food seems too good to be true and should not rely on one "miracle food" to boost health. "If [people] hope to find answers in one food for longevity, I would say they're mistaken," she said.
an icon," she said. Kennedy, recipient of the 2012 Arnold Sports Festival Lifetime Achievement Award, became highly regarded in the fitness industry after founding Robert Kennedy Publishing, which has published 53 books and produces six fitness magazines. Kennedy taught Reno how to eat healthily and work out, and Reno began seeing results. "My physique changed. Everyone started asking questions ... I felt l was owning a secret -- that it is 80% nutrition, 10% training and 10% genetics." Reno revealed her healthy secrets in her first book, "The Eat-Clean Diet." Since then, she has developed a large following of readers. However, all the success in the world could not have prepared Reno for this past spring, when she lost Kennedy, her biggest champion, to lung cancer. She said eating clean has helped her manage her grief and maintain her strength. "I have abundant energy. My emotional energy is strong," she said. "I feel like when you have the nutritional army at work inside of you, you are that much more able to ward off depression." Reno said she is determined to make her late husband proud. In addition to taking the reins at Robert Kennedy Publishing, she will compete in a figure competition October 13 in his honor. In the competition, Reno will be judged on leanness, muscularity, muscle symmetry, evidence of athleticism, poise, grace and confidence. She said her late husband is providing her with all the confidence she needs. "His teachings are guiding me through this," she said. Each day, Reno goes to the gym, which she calls her "drug of choice," and does "reps for Bob." "I'm rebuilding myself," she said. Reno advises all who begin the Eat-Clean Diet have a clear purpose in mind to power them through the process. "Anything new is challenging or different," she said. "But it becomes second nature very quickly." She advises dieters to envision the end result, just like one would envision arriving at a travel destination. "I think you have to have your mind set in place," she said. "What does the end result look like?" Doctors write a prescription for fresh produce Once a goal is determined, Reno said individuals must prepare their surroundings to support that goal. "Clear your cupboards of all junk foods and then start planning healthy meals and shopping for clean food," she said. Reno's books contain meal plans, grocery lists, recipes and motivational tips to help. Always having clean food available is key, Reno said. "When you're cooking dinner, double the recipe and pack the extra food for the next day's meals -- I call these 'planned leftovers,' " she said. "This will make it super easy to just grab a healthy meal when you're pressed for time. Also, when you leave the house, make sure you take a cooler filled with your healthy meals for the day." Reno suggests setting weekly and monthly goals and writing them down. "People who write down their goals are 50% more likely to succeed." Whether easing into the Eat-Clean Diet or diving head first into it, Reno said it's important for dieters to be committed to the process. "You're never going to get to your goals unless you're willing to do what you need to do to get there," she said. The most important way to achieve those goals is to manage time properly, Reno said. "Plan your meals and training sessions for the week and try to delegate chores whenever possible. Once you get into a routine, you'll realize that the whole process is not as hard as you imagined."
Flo Rida wants you to call him. Flo Rida's latest single, "Right Round," was No. 1 on Billboard's pop chart for 10 weeks. In an attempt to reach his fan base on a more intimate level, the Floridian rapper has made his personal cell phone number public. "If they can go out and buy my albums, I can at least make the sacrifice to holler at the few people who call," he says. "A lot of times I'm busy so they'll get my voice mail. And if I can speak to them and I have time, I always text back. Because I think that's very important." To prove that the number he shared on camera during our interview was the real deal, he showed CNN his iPhone. The device was on overdrive, constantly lighting up and vibrating with an influx of texts and calls. "Yo this is your boy Flo Rida," he said to one caller. "What's your name? What's good?" But it was too much for the person on the other end -- he or she hung up before uttering a response.  Watch Flo Rida take a call » "Most of them hang up," says Flo Rida (real name Tramar Dillard). "They don't think it's really me." So how many calls and texts does a top-selling, in-demand rap star actually respond to? "About 30 percent," he says. Flo Rida has been moving quickly these days. His single, "Low," featuring T-Pain, broke digital sales records last year, selling 467,000 downloads in its first week. He's also breaking his own records: His new single "Right Round" sold more than 636,000 downloads in the week after its release. It also hit No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 pop chart. "Right Round" features singer Kesha and borrows an infectious sample from the Dead or Alive hit "You Spin me Round (Like a Record)." It can be found on Flo Rida's sophomore album, "R.O.O.T.S." (Atlantic), which dropped last week, only a year after the release of his debut album, "Mail on Sunday." Flo Rida is also scheduled to be a guest on Wednesday night's "American Idol." Flo Rida talked to CNN about having to record music while on the road, keeping in tune with his international fans, and being a shy guy (yeah, right!). The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: In "Right Round" you sample the '80s group Dead or Alive. Are you a fan of '80s music? Or [do] you just like that song in particular? Flo Rida: I grew up [with] seven sisters so I listened to all types of music. And Dead or Alive was one of the records in particular that I've heard. But my A&R [man] Mike Caren actually brought it to my attention. Me putting out a sophomore album, I thought I'd broaden my horizons, show people my growth, so I got in the studio with Dr. Luke, who's the producer of the song, and we made history. CNN: Seven sisters? Flo Rida: Yeah. I'm the youngest. And I have a twin sister. I'm a twin. CNN: What does "R.O.O.T.S." stand for? Flo Rida: Route of overcoming the struggle. CNN: What do you mean by "struggle"? Flo Rida: I was definitely inspired by the fact that I had a chance to go to Africa recently, did the MTV Awards there. ... But going back to my neighborhood, you know, I had a lot of struggling, too, where it was a lot of drug dealing around me, killing. ... But my mom always instilled in me to keep the faith, dream big and that's what I did. I was a great follower of my mom, very loyal and everything. And right now I'm happy that the world looks at me as a great leader as far as me doing my music and coming with a positive approach. CNN: Your first hit song, "Low," broke digital sales records. How did that change the pace of your career? Flo Rida: We had to hurry up with the album and put it out because we definitely want to keep the attention on the fact that we have a No. 1 record, and let that follow into having a No. 1 album. I'm definitely happy that on this album versus the last, there's more substance so at the same time the fans get a feel of me ... where I come from, how I got the success as well as me being the life of the party. They can continue to have a smile on their faces around the world. Hit the dance floor, shake it off, put your hands in the air and ... the hot ladies have my head spinning right round so I definitely had to get that album out. CNN: It has barely been a year since you released your debut album, so you're really striking while the iron's hot. Are you putting this pressure on yourself or is it mainly coming from outside forces? Flo Rida: The most pressure came from traveling. I actually found myself in hotel rooms in the bathroom, whether I was in Japan or in Sweden, recording records, trying to get an acoustic sound. I definitely worked hard ... it was just a challenge as far as time goes, with me doing two -- sometimes three -- shows a night for two weeks straight. I enjoy doing all the shows and performing, but at the same time all that work -- and trying to put out an album -- was definitely hectic. CNN: You've worked hard to build up your overseas fan base. Why is having a global audience important to you? Flo Rida: It's very important ... the loyalty that they have overseas. You have a No. 1 record in almost 12 different countries: To me, that's like having nine lives. Most people don't even have an idea that you can really sell music overseas. I always love the fact that I can do things internationally. When I was going to school I took the approach that I wanted to take international business versus just taking business classes. So I always had that approach prior to me doing music. CNN: Are you surprised by how responsive the rest of the world is to American rap? Flo Rida: Most definitely. Sometimes they don't even know the language, and they can repeat a song. CNN: Some might say that your music is less rap and more good-time club jams. Would you agree with that? Flo Rida: People can have their own thoughts of what they think it is. But for the most part I'm happy that they know it's music. CNN: What kind of feedback do you get when you have a hit record? What do people tell you they like about it? Flo Rida: At this moment everybody wants to be a rock star, so it has that vibe in it. The way I ride a beat definitely gets everybody's attention. And in using a Dead or Alive sample intertwined with what's going on here in the new millennium is definitely what catches everyone's attention. CNN: What's your dream collaboration? Who would you really like to work with? Flo Rida: Andre 3000. I've always been a fan of OutKast. Every time they drop an album they step it up a notch. And there's a lot of diversity between Andre and Big Boi. CNN: What is the quirkiest thing about you? Flo Rida: Most people see me on stage and they think that I'm this crazy dude, but for the most part I'm a little shy and laid back.
Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill, a saccharine-sweet pink tipple best enjoyed ice cold. And for Beijing-based wine consultant and educator Fongyee Walker, it was that first bottle of grapey Black Tower. "You look at the American market, and the English market -- they were originally beer and spirits markets just like China. What shifted America? White Zin. What shifted England? Black Tower," she tells me. "Very grapey and simple, people can understand them and like them. In China, we haven't done that." In the West, many wine enthusiasts look back fondly to that first fruit-bomb in a glass as our introduction to the world of wine. But in China -- the world's biggest market for red wine -- consumers have gone from zero to premium Lafite in less than two decades. Tasked with making the nation's first fine wines, China's pioneering winemakers have gone for the grandeur and not the "gateway." "The state-owned companies created the wine industry in China. They wanted a Lafite. Not a pink wine," says Simon Zhou, a Shanghai-based wine distributor and founder of Ruby Red Fine Wine. "Many wine companies, especially those state-owned companies, are run by people not in the wine business or have little knowledge of winemaking and grape growing," adds Zhou. "What they are after is to create something they can be proud and to leave some kind of a legacy." WATCH: Inside China's wine country Gifting Zhou says China's "legacy" wines were usually dark red with heavy oak and equally heavy packaging.  At a cost of $80 to $245 a bottle, they were sold through state-owned channels for internal use by local governments. Gifting the bottles is a tradition that extends to today, even in the era of austerity amidst Beijing's crackdown on corruption. "There's the market that buys the wine and won't be consuming the wine, and the other market which is people who buy the wine and are actual consumers. Both markets are in China," says Judy Chan, CEO of China's Grace Vineyard. Grace Vineyard produces some 2 million bottles a year, with retail prices going up to around $90 each. Its Chairman's Reserve and Deep Blue scored impressive ratings from wine guru Robert Parker. "We planted in 1998, and now after 17 years of experiments, I think we can make a very decent wine," Chan tells me. 'Party wine' Private winemakers like Grace Vineyard are experimenting not to replicate a Lafite, but to craft its own signature style. At her vineyard in Shanxi province, I tasted one of Chan's experiments -- a flight of pre-filtered sparkling wines all crafted in China. One particular year nabbed the attention of visiting wine industry folk who hailed it the "party wine" of the tasting. The effervescent and friendly bubbly may very well find its way into the flutes of China's increasingly curious and open-minded wine consumers. "I'm very lucky because I educate and work with people who are getting engaged in wine," says the Beijing-based Walker. "Many moons ago... they talked about Bordeaux and some talked about Burgundy. Now I have students arrive in class and say, 'Well I've heard about Prosecco and I love drinking it!'" Entry-level wines After fast-forwarding from zero to Lafite in less than two decades, China's wine market is finally doing what it should have done at the beginning. It's easing back into user-friendly, entry-level wines. Wine distributor Simon Zhou is starting to see even "big wine" buyers going for more reasonable wines as more Chinese consumers take to wine, and actually drink what they buy. And Walker hopes they will go for the cheap stuff. "There's a reason why McDonalds is the most popular restaurant in the world," she says emphatically. "I just want to see more people drinking more wine. I don't care what wine they drink. Just as long as they're happy." Here's to boxed wine making it big in China. Bottoms up.
a pseudonym used to protect his identity -- was expelled from school and ostracized by members of the community after he was diagnosed in 2011, said the People Daily's newspaper. "He's a ticking time bomb. My daughter is around his age, and goes to a boarding school now. What happens if she gets bitten while playing with him here at home? That boy is too dangerous," says He Jialing, one of the villagers. The report said the boy contracted the disease from his mother before he was born. Kunkun, whose parents are migrant workers in Guangzhou, lives with his 69-year-old grandfather. With no school willing to take him in, he is often found roaming the streets alone. "No one wants to play with me," the newspaper quoted Kunkun as saying. His grandfather told local media the boy's parents have stopped sending money back home since he was diagnosed. In response to the petition, local authorities have stressed that Kunkun's rights should be respected. They plan to launch an educational campaign hoping to reduce the stigma of people living with HIV/AIDS. China's AIDS fight Some 780,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in China, according to the latest count by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 2011. People living with HIV or AIDS in China face widespread discrimination and stigma, especially in rural areas where there is a lack of education about the disease. China has sought to tackle the stigma by establishing laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination against people with HIV. China's First Lady Peng Liyuan who was appointed World Health Organization's goodwill ambassador for AIDS in 2011, has appeared in public advertisements holding hands and playing with HIV-positive children. Despite China's fight against AIDS, cases such as Kunkun's suggest inconsistency with official policy. READ MORE: Campaigners say discrimination hinders China's AIDS fight
With moist eyes and soft voices, former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife pleaded guilty to federal charges on Wednesday related to years of using campaign funds for personal expenses that included purchases of Michael Jackson memorabilia and a Rolex watch. "Guilty, your honor," Jackson responded to U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins while dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief after he looked back at family members in the courtroom, including his father, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. "I used monies that should have been used for campaign purposes," Jackson, 47, acknowledged to the judge. When Wilkins asked if Jackson realized that the guilty plea meant giving up the right to a trial, he responded: "I have no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money." Jackson admitted to diverting about $750,000 for personal purposes from 2005 to 2012. Wilkins set sentencing for June 28, when Jackson could face up to five years in prison. At a separate hearing later on Wednesday, former Chicago Alderman Sandra Stevens Jackson, 49, also pleaded guilty in a quavering voice to one count of filing false tax returns in connection with the misuse of her husband's campaign funds. The charge involved a failure to declare more than $600,000 in income from 2005 to 2011. The total came from campaign funds. She wept openly after returning to the defense table. Wilkins set her sentencing for July 1, when she could receive up to three years in prison. Wednesday's hearings completed the fall of the once politically powerful Chicago couple. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat, won re-election to Congress last year despite personal problems, including a mood disorder, that caused him to drop out of sight for months during the campaign. That coincided with the investigation of campaign fund irregularities dating back several years. Jackson resigned a few weeks after the election, while his wife resigned her position as alderman in January. Prosecutors said the former congressman betrayed the public trust. "The guilty plea today is so tragic because it represents such wasted potential. Jesse Jackson Jr. had drive the ability and the talent to be the voice of a new generation, but he squandered that talent. He exchanged that instead to satisfy his personal whims and extravagant lifestyle," U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said at a news conference. As he left the courthouse following his wife's hearing, Jackson said to reporters: "I'm sorry I let everybody down." At his morning hearing, the former legislator responded to standard legal questions about his soundness of mind by acknowledging his treatment by a psychiatrist. The treatment was not for alcohol or drug abuse, Jackson said, adding that he had a beer on Tuesday night but "I have never been more clear in my life than I am now." "I fully understand the consequences of my actions," he said. His wife's lawyer later told reporters that her decision to plead guilty was influenced in part by her husband's "mental and health issues." The plea showed that Sandra Jackson admits "she'd made some mistakes in judgment regarding expenditures in campaign contributions," said the lawyer, Dan Webb. "She saw this as a chance to accept full responsibility for the conduct she engaged in," he added. Jesse Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and false statements. Wilkins noted that prosecutors and defense attorneys said sentencing guidelines indicated an appropriate term of 46 to 57 months in prison and a fine of between $10,000 and $100,000. The maximum fine under the law for both Jackson and his wife would be $250,000. However, Wilkins said he was not bound by sentencing guidelines, telling Jackson:  "The bottom line is, I don't know what sentence you're going to get and you don't know what sentence you're going to get." Jackson's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, told reporters after the hearing that he would mount a strong legal case for a fair sentence, noting his client is the father of two young children and has the health problems mentioned in court. "It turns out that Jesse has serious health issues," Weingarten said. "... We are going to talk about them extensively with the court and those health issues are directly related to his present predicament. That is not an excuse. That is just a fact.  And Jesse has turned a corner there as well." But Machen said Jackson's illegal activity could not be dismissed as the result of recent mental illness. "It's hard for me to imagine how they're going to reconcile this scheme as being the byproduct of any recent medical condition," he said. "Mr. Jackson engaged in this scheme starting in 2005. It's a seven-year scheme." Last week, prosecutors filed charges against the couple in separate criminal documents used when parties strike plea agreements. The documents say the former congressman misused campaign funds. According to court documents, Jackson's campaign credit cards were used for $582,772 in personal expenditures. Jackson's purchases included a gold-plated men's Rolex watch costing more than $43,000 and almost $10,000 in children's furniture. As part of the plea agreement, Jackson is supposed to repay the $750,000 in improperly used funds. Prosecutors said they would seize and sell many of the pieces of memorabilia and other items Jackson purchased and apply the proceeds to the debt. The items include two hats belonging to the late singer Michael Jackson costing more than $8,000; a $5,000 football signed by U.S. presidents; and memorabilia involving the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and martial artist Bruce Lee. Another expenses incurred using the campaign credit card were a five-day stay at Martha's Vineyard Holistic Retreat in 2008 for $5,687.75, and a $4,272.78 charge in 2006 for on-board cruise expenses to Navigator of the Sea, according to court documents. Jackson issued a statement through his attorneys on Friday that said, in part: "I offer no excuses for my conduct and I fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made." Jackson's wife is not mentioned by name in the document outlining misuse of campaign funds. But there are references to her as "Co-Conspirator 1," a former consultant and later the manager of Jackson's re-election campaign. According to the court documents, "Co-Conspirator 1" bought $5,150 worth of fur capes and parkas and had them shipped from Beverly Hills, California, to Washington. Jesse Jackson Jr. had represented 2nd Congressional District in Illinois since 1995. His name came up during the investigation of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, linked to allegations that Blagojevich attempted to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. No charges were filed against Jackson, but the House Ethics Committee decided to look into whether Jackson or an associate offered to raise a large amount of money for Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson getting the Senate seat. Jackson dropped out of sight last spring and his office later said he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic for a mood disorder, depression and gastrointestinal problems. He was re-elected in November but resigned a few weeks later. His father recently said his son was "taking his medication and handling his challenges." The elder Jackson had no comment after Wednesday's hearings, telling reporters, "not today."
China's military is developing longer-range ballistic and anti-ship missiles that are "shifting the balance of power in the region" and could help Beijing secure resources or settle territorial disputes, a report released by the Pentagon said Wednesday. U.S. and Chinese militaries need "resumption of dialogue,"  Adm. Timothy Keating told Congress. China also continues to build up short-range missiles and increase its "coercive capabilities" against Taiwan. The report suggests such moves constitute an effort to pressure Taiwan into settling the cross-strait dispute in favor of China, though tensions between the two countries have receded over the past year. The report, called the "Military Power of the People's Republic of China," is the Pentagon's annual briefing to Congress on the status of the communist country's military might. While China continues to proclaim that its military buildup is for defense purposes to protect its interests, the report says the country's lack of transparency is worrisome and could lead to an unintended conflict. "The limited transparency in China's military and security affairs poses risks to stability by creating uncertainty and increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation," according to the report. "Much uncertainty surrounds China's future course, particularly regarding how its expanding military power might be used." The lack of transparency causes Washington "to speculate to some degree on what their intentions are," Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters at a Wednesday briefing. According to Adm. Timothy Keating, the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, some of that uncertainty is due to the cessation of talks between the Chinese and U.S. militaries. In March of 2008, the United States and China installed a hot line between the two countries' militaries. But there have been no military-to-military talks since November 2008, when Washington announced it was selling weapons to Taiwan. "We are looking for the resumption of that dialogue so we can engage in discussion with our colleagues in the People's Republic of China and their Army, Navy and Air Force so we can have a sense of their way ahead," Keating told the House Armed Services committee on Tuesday. "We don't have a clear idea of their broad strategic way ahead." The Pentagon report comes after a recent incident in which Chinese ships, including a Chinese navy vessel, confronted an unarmed U.S. Navy surveillance ship in the South China Sea in international waters. The confrontation prompted the United States to move a destroyer ship to the area to protect the surveillance vessel. While the report does not discuss the incident, it notes the importance China puts on controlling its waterways and the surrounding territories because "China's economic and political power is contingent upon access to and use of the sea, and that a strong navy is required to safeguard such access." The analysis also said that while much of China's capability is more for regional disputes, it did send two destroyers and one supply ship off the coast of Africa to protect Chinese vessels from pirate attacks. That move was a sign of Chinese intent to expand its militaries to protect expanding economic and political interests around the world, according to a China analyst. "The Chinese military is being told to develop capabilities to deal with Chinese national interests beyond the pure defense of Chinese territory," said David Finklestein, the Director of China Studies for CNA, a nonprofit research group that does analysis for the U.S. military and other clients. "China, with a global economy, now obviously has global political interests and clearly has expanding global security interests." Though the Pentagon report concludes that "China's ability to sustain military power at a distance remains limited," it does have a growing space program, nuclear weapon system and cyber warfare capabilities, "the only aspects of China's armed forces that, today, have the potential to be truly global," the report explained. In citing China's cyber warfare, the report notes that U.S. government computers were the target of "intrusions that appear to have originated" from China, although they were not confirmed to be from the military.
From bedroom creators to big studios, hand-drawn to CGI, animation has charmed and entertained children -- and, increasingly, adults -- for many years. The Screening Room went to Annecy in France to discover the secrets of success in animated films... Annecy has hailed animators like director Tim Burton, seen here receiving a special award at Annecy in 2006. Annecy is the Cannes of animation. The French town, which lies close to the Swiss border just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Geneva, has hosted the International Animated Film Festival for almost half a century and attracts a younger crowd than many of the major film festivals. With prizes for long and short features, television and student animation, Annecy highlights a wide variety of different types of animation and budgets. One veteran of Annecy is Craig Decker, known as worldwide cult figure "Spike" and co-founder of "Spike and Mike's Sick & Twisted Festival of Animation." Beginning 30 years ago as a means of bringing independent animation to new audiences, the touring festival was instrumental in showcasing the early works of legendary animators such as Tim Burton, Pixar's John Lasseter and Aardman's Nick Park, as well as the first episode of "Beavis and Butthead." Spike explained to CNN the challenge of getting animation taken seriously. He said, "Originally we had to deal with the stigma. We showed great films like National Film Board of Canada [pieces], or "Tin Toy" by John Lasseter, works of art, masterpieces that take two to three years to make, and we had to deal with, 'What is it? Cartoons like Bugs Bunny or something like that?' And over the years we've educated the public, and we've put animation in the context of a very cool thing [with] a young, hip, adult audience of 18 and over." Stop-motion classics One of Spike and Mike's biggest fans, Nick Park, won the Annecy award for Best TV Animation with "Shaun the Sheep," a spin-off from "A Close Shave," one of Aardman's famous Wallace and Gromit short features that grabbed an Oscar. Stop-motion is also close to the heart of director Tim Burton, who employed the technique on "Corpse Bride" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas." He said, "Because it's such an old-fashioned technique, a lot of it truly has to do with finding the right group of animators, the right group of people to build the puppets, because a lot of things are being done by computer now. Very few people are doing this style of animation." Allison Abbate, a producer on "Corpse Bride," added, "Stop motion is an age-old process as far as animation in film-making goes. It hasn't really changed since the days of King Kong - we used new technology in 'Corpse Bride' to bring it into a new century." Appropriate animation "I think there's room for all types of animation," she continued. "It depends on the story. The story should really decide how you tell it. I think there are stories that are better made in 2-D and CGI and that's what you'd go for." 2-D animation is the mainstay of Japanese anime - a subject so vast it will command its own feature in a subsequent edition of the Screening Room. The film "Paprika" has won worldwide critical praise during the past year as a sophisticated example of the art, whose keenest supporters are sometimes contemptuous of their Hollywood animation counterparts. Asia is becoming an increasingly powerful force in animation, where companies who traditionally provided a cheap source of labor for animation studios are now using their skills to take a leading role in the creative process. UTV Toons is one of several Indian companies forming partnerships with big U.S. production houses to make new animated features. Combination of skills Animation requires a combination of several skills, as producer Allison Abbate explained. She told CNN that animators face many complex challenges. "Animators have to know how to move things, how things work anatomically in a space, but they also have to know how to act, how to emote and that is what makes animation so different from live action. It is so crafted, one frame at a time." But Spike points out that the rewards animation promises can be very high. "Obviously in features, look at the most successful films," he told CNN. "They're nearly all animated Pixar pieces or, if it's live action, it's the special effects animation that carries the film." And the future? Spike believes animation is going mobile. He said, "Internationally, what's exciting is with new media: with digital; with broadband; with mobile phones. That's where we're going with our stuff." E-mail to a friend
The scene of some of the bloodiest fighting from the First World War will be commemorated by this year's Tour de France. A hundred years after the start of the global conflict and the first battle of Ypres, the Flemish town will host stage five of cycling's blue-riband event. During World War 1 there were three battle at Ypres, with over 900,000 British, French and German casualties. It is a nod by Tour organisers to a conflict that had a major bearing on the race. For four years -- from 1915 to 1918 -- the race was cancelled while some of its first overall victors lost their lives in the war, namely Francois Faber, Octave Lapize and Lucien Petit-Breton. The modern-day focal point for Ypres violent past is the Menin Gate, completed in 1927, and a memorial to the British and Commonwealth soldiers that lost their lives in what today is a relatively sleepy town with a population of just 35,000 people. "We of course cannot forget them. The Tour is also a moment of collective remembrance," said Tour director Christian Prudhomme. From a racing perspective, the stage could have a significant impact on the race as it boasts nine cobblestone sections along part of the route of the classic day race Paris-Roubaix, often referred to as "the Hell of the North". The last time the Tour visited sustained periods of cobbles during the 2010 race, it resulted in a litany of crashes and the exit of some notable Tour contenders, namely Frank Schleck. When defending Tour champion Chris Froome was asked to come up with is ideal Tour route last week, he admitted he wanted plenty of time trials and no cobblestones. Revelation of this 2014 route -- starting in the UK town of Leeds and finishing in Paris -- was not quite the antithesis of the defending champion's dream Tour but there was a sense organisers were perhaps trying to halt the British hegemony and a possible hat-trick of British winners after Bradley Wiggins success in 2012. The route boasts just 33.5 kilometres against the clock -- the smallest amount for 80 years. That said, it comes on the penultimate stage, thereby giving Froome one final throw of the dice should he have a deficit to make up. More precariously lying in wait is the aforementioned cobblestones. Prior to the route announcement, Froome had said: "What worries me about cobbles are the crashes, the mechanical problems. A mechanical problem in the wrong moment of the race when things are kicking off could lead to you losing the Tour. "I'm not a big fan of that. It's the unknown factor that worries me about the cobbles." More positively for Froome is the volume of mountainous terrain scheduled for the route. This summer, he showed he was comfortably the best climber in the field, so the 2014 race's five mountain-top finishes should play to his strengths. This year, the Alps first lies in wait, some of it familiar territory for Froome, including La Planche des Belles Filles, scene of his first stage win in the Tour. Arguably the toughest terrain, however, is the Pyrenean stages that follow. For the second time in the race's history it will begin in Britain, this time in the county of Yorkshire, the Grand Depart (the official start of the race) taking place in its major city Leeds. Froome's defence of the yellow jersey, handed out to the Tour leader, is likely to come notably from this year's runner-up Nairo Quintana as well as Italian Vicenzo Nibali and former winner Alberto Contador. Sprinter Mark Cavendish will be hoping to add to the British success on home soil by winning the first stage in Harrogate where his mother lives.
South Sudan's military has quashed an attempted coup, President Salva Kiir said Monday, after heavy gunfire gripped the capital of Juba. Dressed in fatigues and flanked by government officials, Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his sacked deputy Riek Machar for starting the fighting. In a televised address, he said the government was in full control of the capital, and announced a nighttime curfew. "They tried to carry out a coup -- a so-called coup d'etat -- but they have failed," Kiir said. "All the people who were involved in this will be arrested." He said a nighttime curfew "for the sake of security and safety of our citizens" would run from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. A move by Kiir to dismiss his Cabinet in July has further inflamed deep-running tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. Earlier, heavy gunfire was reported in the city, government official Peter Biar Ajak said. The U.S. and British embassies in Juba urged their citizens via Twitter to stay indoors and be cautious. "Gunshots/artillery fired over the past few hours in several locations in Juba," the U.S. Mission in Juba tweeted. Sporadic gunfire In a statement on its Facebook page, the U.S. Embassy said that while there was now a lull in violence, it continued to receive reports of sporadic gunfire in parts of the city, particularly near Juba University. It said the airport was not operational. It recommended that U.S. citizens use "caution at this time," adding that travel in Juba was not currently safe. It also reiterated an earlier tweet denying Machar had taken shelter there. "We take this opportunity to reaffirm our earlier message that no political or military figures have taken refuge within the U.S. Embassy," the mission said. In a separate statement, the embassy said it was "deeply concerned at the recent outbreak of armed violence" in Juba and echoed calls from the U.N. envoy there for all parties to "cease hostilities immediately and exercise restraint." The British Embassy has issued an alert advising British nationals against all nonessential movement in parts of the country. South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011, after decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country. Women, children flee to U.N. compound Hundreds of people, mainly women and children, have taken shelter at the U.N. compound near the airport and at a U.N. house in the city, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said. "We hope the security situation in Juba will quickly normalize to enable the civilians to return very soon to their residential areas. To that end, UNMISS calls on all parties to show continued calm and restraint," it said in a statement. It also denied "any suggestion that the U.N. Mission is harboring any key political or military figures."

Whenever President Obama has traveled overseas and offered pointed and direct assessments of the United States, some of them critical, Republicans have ripped him for criticizing America, saying a president should always defend the United States. So I want to hear the explanation by these so-called patriots of their giddy behavior over the United States losing the 2016 Olympic Games. Yes, the United States. The bid that was rejected Friday by the International Olympic Committee was not a Chicago, Illinois, bid. It was the official bid submitted by the United States Olympic Committee and was representative of the nation. Tokyo's bid was that of Japan; Madrid's was that of Spain; and Rio de Janeiro's was that of Brazil. Republicans want to spin the decision as a massive loss by President Obama and the Democrats who have always controlled Chicago politics. "Hahahahaha," wrote Erick Erickson on the conservative "RedState" blog, "I thought the world would love us more now that Bush was gone." What the critics don't see is that Obama's loss on the Olympics is America's loss. Any red-blooded American who loves to see the American flag raised and the national anthem played when one of our own wins a gold medal should blast the Republicans' giddiness over the loss. I can recall crying along with millions of Americans when our hockey team beat the Russians and won the hockey gold in 1980. Where were those games? Lake Placid, New York. Euphoria spread all across the nation, not only because we beat the mighty Russians, but also because it took place on American soil. When Carl Lewis and Mary Lou Retton dominated the 1984 Olympic Games, we all beamed with pride because they represented the United States on American soil in Los Angeles, California. And when Michael Johnson stormed around the track to obliterate the world record in the 200-meter dash (since broken by Jamaica's Usain Bolt), we relished the win as he took a victory lap around the stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Americans love home field advantage, and we always desire to show the rest of the world what we are made of. I don't care if Republicans want to rip President Obama over going to Copenhagen, Denmark, to pitch for the games. This isn't about politics. It's not about ideology. This is about America. OUR pride. Our chance to shine. Our loss of the games. So, to all the critics happy about us losing the 2016 games, turn in your flag lapel pins and stop boasting of being so patriotic. When an American city loses, like New York did in the the last go-round, we all lose. And all you critics are on the same level as the America haters all across the world. You should be shouted down for not backing your own country. The next time any of you bang out a press release about "Buy American" or "Support our troops," remember this moment when your cynical, callous and small-minded brains happily rejoiced when America lost the 2016 Olympic Games. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.
Bubba Watson believes he can now challenge golf's top stars after heading off three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson for an emotional victory at Torrey Pines in California on Sunday. The 32-year-old climbed 15 places in the world rankings to 18th as he claimed the second PGA Tour title of his career at the Farmers Insurance Open, while fellow American Mickelson reclaimed the No. 4 spot after finishing second on his first start this season. Watson started the final round one shot behind joint overnight leader Mickelson but carded an impressive five-under-par 67, which included six birdies and just one bogey, to finish the San Diego tournament on 16 under. World number four Mickelson could have forced Watson into a playoff had he made eagle on the 18th hole, but a miss from 72 yards allowed his Florida-born opponent to celebrate victory by just a single shot. Mickelson's fellow overnight leader Bill Haas faded badly on the final day, finishing on nine under after a 75. For Watson the victory was particularly emotional following the death of his father to cancer last year, shortly after his only other PGA Tour win at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut. "It means a lot," he told reporters. "I'll probably cry all day, just like last time." The 32-year-old said the win had given him the confidence to compete with the world's best at major championships. "In my mind, I believe I can be a top-five player. I want to. I want to be number one in the world. I want to win every golf tournament," he said. "I want to perform every week. I want to be on every Ryder Cup team, every Presidents Cup team. I believe I can do it. I truly believe it." San Diego-born Mickelson, a three-time winner on the Torrey Pines course, said he was disappointed not to have made a better start to the season at his local tournament. "I wanted to start the year off with a win," the 40-year-old said. "But on the other hand, I played really good golf and gave myself an opportunity. "I played well on Sunday and had a good tournament. Hopefully, I'll use this as a springboard for next week." Former world number one Tiger Woods made a poor start to 2011, finishing in a disappointing 44th position. In his first competition of the year, the event's five-time champion failed to birdie any of the par-fives and finished with a round of 75. "I have some work to do. There's no doubt about that," the American said. "I hit it as pure as I could possibly hit it starting out, but got nothing out of it." Venezuelan rookie Jhonattan Vegas followed up his victory at the Bob Hope Classic last weekend with a third-place finish as he ended the tournament on 13 under along with American Dustin Johnson. Vegas shot 68, and his third bogey of the day at 18 meant he shared the prize money with Johnson, who ended with two birdies in his flawless 66. D.A. Points was fourth on 12 under after a 67, while fellow Americans Nick Watney (63), Anthony Kim (72) and Hunter Mahan (72) were tied for sixth on 10 under. Watney, starting on the back nine of the South Course, started with five successive birdies, picked up three more from 16, and capped his round with an eagle three at the sixth.
Catherine Schmidt-Jones, or Kitty as she's known to her friends, is, in her words, "an obscure music teacher in Champaign, Illinois." Kitty Schmidt-Jones, whose Connexions modules have been viewed over 7 million times But that's not strictly true: Schmidt-Jones is far from obscure. Through her online music courses, she has reached thousands of people and her teaching material has been viewed online -- over 7 million times. Schmidt-Jones is just one of a growing number of professors and teachers who are using the Web site Connexions (cnx.org) to reach potential students. And what's more, they're doing it for free. Connexions was set up by Rice University professor Richard Baraniuk in 1999. He wanted to produce learning materials for his electrical engineering students, but was frustrated by how expensive and slow it would be to produce a textbook. "The access was going to be limited -- it would only be available to just a few students from the United States," he told CNN. "In the developing world, it would basically not be available at all. "And the production process is just incredibly slow. For example, to get Pluto out of all of our nation's textbooks will take a decade. By then, Pluto will be reinstated as a planet, so we'll have to put it back in." So Baraniuk decided to do something different. At the time, he was learning about Linux software. It dawned on him that its open source concepts could be adapted for education. "I realized that there was a better way that was enabled by information technology, where we could author textbooks as a community and make them free and open for people to use and reuse," he explained. On the Connexions Web site, authors can upload bite-sized chunks of learning materials called "modules." Modules can be strung together to form whole courses, or "collections." Anyone can build a collection from any combination of modules -- so, for example, a module on Shakespeare's Hamlet could appear in collections on literature, Elizabethan history or dramatic arts. This building-block approach means that courses can be adapted both for personal use and by teachers who can tailor each collection for a particular curriculum, class or even an individual student. To ensure the quality of its content, the site supports peer-review and endorsement of modules by third parties and all material is attributed to the author. And once a collection is assembled, a textbook version can be printed on demand through third-party Qoop for around $24 -- considerably less than the cost of most college textbooks, but still enough to pay the author a slice of the royalties. "A lot of the back-end that's been handled by traditional publishers can be handled very efficiently by this new breed of information technology," Baraniuk explains. "So we can lower the cost for everybody, sometimes to zero for materials that are online." The Connexions formula is certainly working. Today, the site has nearly 5,000 modules written by university professors, school teachers and other educators, and while most are in the sciences (reflecting its roots) the arts and humanities are growing. The content attracts 600,000 users a month, ranging from K-12 children to university-level engineering students. Fifty percent of its traffic comes from outside the United States, with 30-40 percent coming from the developing world. And as the site grows, Baraniuk is seeing a rise in the number of people using its modules, especially in the arts and humanities, for informal learning. Even governments are starting to notice its potential. Connexions recently obtained an Official Memo of Understanding to supply Vietnam with course materials, with more partner countries in the pipeline. And Connexions is crossing language barriers, too. While most of the site's modules are in English, the site's volunteer translators help meet the demand for educational materials in other languages, where translation and production of traditional textbooks is often prohibitively expensive. "My particular book in Connexions is fairly popular," Baraniuk explains, "But I was translated by three volunteer engineering students in University of Texas, El Paso and my book is far more popular in Spanish than it is in English. "That really gives you a sense of the global reach." But perhaps its most striking benefit is the site's ability to connect talented educators who would not have considered going the traditional publishing route, like Catherine Schmidt-Jones, with people who want to learn but don't have access to books. Those authors are seizing the opportunity to pass on their knowledge. "I don't think any publisher of music textbooks would even have looked at my material," Schmidt-Jones told CNN. "For me to go to a publisher and say, 'Hey I'm a really good writer, you should look at my textbooks!' -- I don't think that ever would have happened." While she writes with her students in mind, Schmidt-Jones's work has been used by people from North America to Australia, Argentina to Uganda. She gets emails every week from teachers and students who've found her material helpful: "Your explanation of minor keys and scales saved my theory life. Thanks," reads one example. "Thank you for the great explanation of perfect intervals! It was very helpful to our class," reads another. It's this response that's prompted her to write more for the site. "Doing something that's so wildly popular, it makes me feel good about myself. It's a pat on the back that I'm doing the right thing and that people appreciate it," she told CNN. Schmidt-Jones currently has 167 modules available through Connexions. Some she can knock off in an afternoon. The more complex modules, with sound files, figures and diagrams, can take a couple of days to write. Schmidt-Jones fits this around her tutoring -- it's what she does for fun. She's also helped a friend of hers publish on the site. Richard Baraniuk praises her work highly. "She is just the tip of the iceberg of a new community of authors who are going to be able to really enrich and enliven educational material for everyone," he told CNN. And through Connexions, they can reach an eye-poppingly wide audience. "They can really amplify their impact to a truly global level," he said. And for Schmidt-Jones, it's an outlet for her passion for teaching. "I'm convinced that making a good education available to everyone is one of THE answers to fixing all the things that are wrong with the world," she told CNN. "It's difficult to express how exciting it is to feel that I'm actively contributing to an effort to do that." ........................ Can open-source online learning replace the textbook?

Along with hearing the announcement about the Verizon iPhone Tuesday, we've learned that Apple's iPad -- which has been marketed by Verizon for some time -- will now actually be able to connect directly to the Verizon network. We realize that connecting the device to the network sounds like a no-brainer. However, for the past few months, folks with Verizon iPads have had to buy separate external Verizon MiFi devices in order to connect when Wi-Fi wasn't available. Now, as Apple's exclusivity with AT&T comes to a close, the iPad will be able to connect directly to Verizon's 3G -- and who knows, perhaps even its 4G LTE -- network. The latter would bring it to parity with Motorola's Xoom, a new Android-powered tablet recently announced at CES. iPads with embedded Verizon chips will be coming soon; however, an exact release date hasn't yet been set. The iPad first came to Verizon in October 2010. Although connecting to the network when Wi-Fi wasn't present did require a bundled MiFi, costs were comparable and data plans were better than what AT&T customers were getting. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

A pair of earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 5.0 struck within 90 minutes of each other near Christchurch, New Zealand, on Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, reviving vivid memories of a deadly quake that killed more than 180 people in February. "Everyone is on edge here anyway," said Rhys Taylor, who said he could hear sirens and see helicopters flying over Christchurch. "Obviously, power's out -- sort of all over the city at the moment -- and phone lines are down." Police evacuated sections of the city's central business district after reports of a possible gas leak, police said. Several bridges in the city were closed as a precaution. "It was quite an exciting ride," Christchurch Police Acting Inspector Murray Hurst told CNN after the first quake, adding that there was some damage caused by the quake and a few injuries that were not life-threatening. The first quake -- a magnitude 5.2 -- was centered 9 kilometers (5 miles) east-southeast of Christchurch at a depth of 11 kilometers (6.8 miles), according to USGS. The quake took place at 1 p.m. Monday. A second quake -- a more powerful 6.0 tremor -- struck at 2:20 p.m., roughly 13 kilometers (8 miles) north-northeast of the city at a depth of 9 kilometers (5.6 miles). And at least one smaller quake followed. A magnitude 4.6 quake struck at 2:40 p.m. about 11 kilometers (6 miles) east of Christchurch and at a depth of 12.5 kilometers (7.8 miles), according to the USGS. The quakes came nearly four months after a 6.3-magnitude temblor struck the same area, killing more than 180 people. CNN's Jack Maddox and Anisha Bhandari contributed to this report.
Roaches crawling out of air vents. Roaches climbing up seats and windows. Roaches on people's coats and hats. Roaches everywhere. It sounds like a scene from a horror movie -- but is in fact what passengers say happened on a Greyhound bus journey from Atlantic City to New York on Friday. "There's like a thousand roaches," passenger Dawn Alexander told CNN affiliate WABC. "And when I say infested, I mean infested. People were in the aisles literally brushing roaches off of them." "We thought it was one. It turned out to be a whole house full of roaches," said a fellow passenger. "I sat down -- roaches started crawling up on our clothes, falling down from the ceiling. Everything," said another. Cellphone footage shows the pests scurrying across the bus floor and steps. Greyhound's Media Relations Director Maureen Richmond said the bus driver had acted swiftly when passengers alerted him to "bugs on the bus." Bionic cockroaches to the rescue "He immediately pulled the bus over and radioed our dispatch office for assistance," she told CNN. "A second bus was immediately sent to continue the trip into New York. We have spoken with each passenger and provided full refunds." Greyhound has apologized for the inconvenience to the 48 passengers on board the bus, which departed Atlantic City around 10 a.m. Friday. "We are investigating how they got there -- in bags or from the bus," said Richmond. What caused the insects to start pouring out of the air vents about 15 minutes into the journey is not yet clear -- nor what Greyhound plans to do to get rid of them. Alexander told WABC she was sitting in the back of the bus when she saw those toward the front starting to panic. "Then after a while, the panic got towards the back because we all started looking around and saw roaches crawling everywhere," she said. According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, roaches "are common even in the cleanest of crowded urban areas and older dwellings" and are found in all types of neighborhoods. Happily, the pests don't usually hitch a ride on a bus to the Big Apple. In 2011: AirTran sued over cockroaches on flight CNN's Erinn Cawthon contributed to this report.
Giant jellyfish descend on the Sea of Japan, causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind. A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005. Sounds like a great sci-fi flick. But it's not. It's real and a nightmare for Japanese fishermen. The massive sea creatures, called Nomura's jellyfish, can grow 6 feet (1.83 meters) in diameter and weigh more than 450 pounds (204 kilos). Scientists think they originate in the Yellow Sea and in Chinese waters. For the third year since 2005, ocean currents are transporting them into the Sea of Japan. Monty Graham, a marine biologist at Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents. He said they stay together in packs and as they drift northward, they get caught in fishermen's nets. The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world. But Nomura's stands out because of its enormous size. "The sheer size of them, individually, makes them fairly spectacular," Graham said. Spectacular, perhaps, to scientists, but perilous to villagers along the Japanese coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past. They had giant-jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007, and because they've recently been spotted in the Sea of Japan, they're bracing for another, potentially harmful wave this summer. The jellyfish destroy fishermen's nets, getting trapped in them, tearing holes and ruining catches. Fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers. When swarms of giant jellyfish tear them, the result is devastating. "Communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets," Graham said. "When these nets get wiped out, it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community." The good news is that previous attacks have prompted Japan to put in place a warning system for fishermen. While they still risk losing a big catch, they can, at least, save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish. It's not clear why waves of Nomura's jellyfish have made it to the Sea of Japan in recent years. Some have speculated that overfishing, pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on Nomura's jellyfish in the polyp stage. However, no one is certain, Graham said.
A former Ohio doctor was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison for poisoning his wife with cyanide five years ago. A Cleveland jury convicted Yazeed Essa last week of aggravated murder for poisoning Rosemarie Essa, his wife and the mother of his two children, with a cyanide-laced calcium pill. Essa, 41, will be eligible for parole in 20 years, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Bill Mason said. His crime occurred before Ohio sentencing laws were changed to give judges discretion in determining when a convicted murderer is eligible for parole. Dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit, Essa did not betray an emotion as Judge Deena Calabrese lamented that she could not hand down a stiffer sentence "I regret that you have the benefit of committing this crime under the old law," Calabrese told Essa. "You took an oath to preserve life and you destroyed your family," she said. "I cannot imagine the evil that you have done to these people, especially your children. It is my great hope and the only that I can think of at this moment that they forget you ... and that whatever legacy you had is wiped away." The six-week trial included testimony from more than 60 witnesses who told the story of a philandering doctor, his many mistresses and an international manhunt that crossed three continents and ended with his arrest in Cyprus in October 2006, 18 months after his wife's death. "What do you say to a person that murders the mother of his children, a murdering coward with no heart, no compassion, no remorse?" Rosemarie Essa's mother, Virginia DiPuccio, said at her son-in-law's sentencing hearing Tuesday. "All she wanted was children and a husband that loved her back and you took that away. She didn't deserve it," DiPuccio said as other relatives sat in the packed courtroom audience, dabbing tears with tissues. Essa fled the United States in March 2005 after police questioned him about his wife's death. He was arrested in Cyprus on October 7, 2006, for using fake travel documents. In January 2009, Essa was extradited to Cuyahoga County, according to the prosecutor's office. Defense attorneys pointed to a lack of physical evidence linking Essa to the tainted supplements and urged jurors not to convict him for his playboy lifestyle. The defense also attempted to cast suspicion on Essa's mistresses. Two of them testified, one saying she never loved Essa and another saying she believed him when he promised to be her soul mate. The 38-year-old mother of two and former nurse was driving to the movies in the family Volvo on February 24, 2005, when she felt ill, passed out and hit another vehicle before stopping against a curb. Before she crashed, she called a friend from her car and told her that she was beginning to feel sick to her stomach and wondered whether a supplement her husband had given her was making her ill. Jurors heard from the friend, Eva Gardner, along with two of Essa's mistresses and his brother, who said Essa admitted to killing his wife. DiPuccio said her daughter made the phone call so he wouldn't get away with murder. "It didn't go your way," she said, as a stone-faced Essa listened. "She got you, Yaz, and the Essa curse ends here today. We have Rosie in our memory. She's in our hearts and with us always."
The Israeli ambassador to Jordan has returned to Amman a day after security concerns pushed officials to send much of the embassy staff home early, an Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said Friday. All but a skeleton staff at the Israeli Embassy in Amman went home due to security concerns Thursday. Staffers typically travel between Amman and Israel every Friday and Saturday, but they were sent home a day early this week after last week's ransacking of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo by protesters and plans for anti-Israel protests this week in Amman. The turnout for Thursday's demonstration in the Jordanian capital, however, was small and the Israeli ambassador returned Friday. The full embassy staff is expected to be back at work Sunday in Amman. Anti-Israel expressions and demonstrations have been taking place in Amman recently. A Facebook page calling for a million-man protest to close the Israeli Embassy in Amman has more than 3,000 people signed up as "attending" the event. Also, protesters against Jordan's ties with Israel have been gathering every Thursday outside an Amman mosque for more than a year. Those who organize the gatherings refer to themselves as the jama'at al-Kalouti, which means "the group of the Kalouti,"  named after the mosque near the Israeli Embassy in western Amman. The protesters are calling for the closure of the embassy, the expulsion of the ambassador and annulment of the 1994 peace treaty that established diplomatic relations between Jordan and Israel. On Thursday night, about 400 people gathered outside the mosque, according to Petra, Jordan's state-run news agency. Eyewitnesses reported that security was increased around the already-fortified embassy in the western part of Amman in anticipation of the protest. More than half of Jordan's 6.5 million residents are of Palestinian origin. On September 9, an estimated 3,000 Egyptian protesters tore down a wall surrounding the building that houses the Israeli Embassy in Cairo and entered its offices, tossing papers bearing Hebrew writing from the windows and into the streets. Egyptians have been angry about the killing last month of five Egyptian police officers by Israeli soldiers when Israel went after militants who had attacked civilians near the Israeli-Egyptian border.

The tight Senate race in Iowa just won't budge. The race opposing Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley is still locked in a dead heat according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. Ernst just barely edges out her Democratic rival by two points 45-43, a lead that keeps her within the poll's margin of error. The contest could tilt the balance of power in Washington in a year when Republicans are favored to take back the Senate. The results from the survey of 967 likely voters in Iowa echoes the two other nonpartisan polls in this month which also showed Ernst with a razor-thin one- to two-point edge. In Iowa, a fight for 2014's early voters Now, the two candidates will fight for undecided voters and the 10 percent of likely voters who said they could still change their mind before Nov. 4. And while the overall numbers don't appear to be shifting, Braley's camp can look to the pulse of Independents for a campaign pick-me-up less than three weeks away from Election Day. The poll revealed a big swing in independent support, with Braley converting a seven-point deficit in Quinnipiac's September poll into a five-point lead among the key voter bloc. Braley now leads with independents 48% to Ernst's 43%. Green issues at the center of closely watched debate in Iowa Senate race Braley also continued to pick up support among women, who favor him over his female GOP foe by a 13-point margin. Ernst, meanwhile, kept her lead among men at a 56% to Braley's 39%. "Voters are choosing partisanship over gender when it comes to making their ballot choice," Quinnipiac University Polling Director Peter Brown said in a release. Ernst will look to pick up on the benefits of votes voting for the same party down the ballot as Republican Gov. Terry Branstad is expected to slide cleanly through the polls. Branstad has a 15-point lead according to the Quinnipiac poll. Hambycast: Branstad's mustachioed superstition exposed
In the ancient Syrian city of Homs, locals used to enjoy a vibrant cafÃ© culture and relatively easy living. The city was a Syrian success, a center for agriculture, oil and trade; a home to Shia, Sunni and Alawite Muslims as well as a small Christian community among its one million people. The road through Homs connects Syria's largest city, Aleppo, in the north, to the capital, Damascus, in the south, and it's from there that President Bashar al-Assad's military has come. Those days are now distant memories as the city became the heart of an anti-government uprising and this week became the focal point of the regime's brutal clampdown. Rebels and civilians holed up in the besieged city are dying under a relentless barrage of rocket fire. The Syrian military has surrounded it with tanks and heavy weapons, and snipers are positioned on roofs, picking off anyone who dares to walk the streets, opposition activists say. They fear that now, after a brutal week-long assault, the army could be about to move in to wipe out the resistance. No one knows for sure how many people are living under the barrage. They cower in their homes as shells explode, destroying buildings and killing indiscriminately. The death toll is rising daily as world leaders talk, but with powerhouses China and Russia so far siding with Syria, there has been little more than rhetorical support. One man, who has got the message from Homs out to the wider world via YouTube and CNN, is 'Danny' -- an assumed name to protect his identity. Pain etched across his young face, Danny said: "They are going to kill us all and if you don't help us, they'll kill millions and no one will find out about it. Please, someone help us." After the failure last week by the U.N. Security Council to agree on a resolution condemning the violence, Homs has seen some of the fiercest attacks yet by Assad's army. One resident, who called himself Aslan said Wednesday: "There is helicopter now that attack Baba Amr area. "Thirty minute ago, two helicopters. Too much shooting before. And explosions in some homes there. "In my room, beside with my friend, because my family [left the area, they are too scared] No electricity. No [internet] network. No anything. We have Thuraya [a hand-held satellite phone]. Also Lebanese [cell phone] network. "No medicine, need oxygen now [for hospitals]." At a hospital in Baba Amr on Thursday the dead and the injured were arriving around the clock. Ali, a doctor, said: "All I have is gauze, bandages, old stitches and (a) few antiseptic wipes." He has no surgical equipment to help the wounded. As he spoke to CNN by telephone there were seven thundering explosions. He believed Syrian jets were firing on the city but he did not want to look out the window to check in case it cost him his life. "There is now way to flee Baba Amr because all surrounding suburbs are also under attack and anything that moves is shot at," Hazoury says. He reckons the assault has damaged 60 percent of homes in Baba Amr. Families who did try to escape were captured by government forces and killed, said an opposition spokesman, who CNN is calling Abu Rami. Videos purporting to show the violence in Homs appear to support the accounts of witnesses, although it is not possible to independently confirm their authenticity. In one scene, a row of buildings painted in pink and blue pastels survived intact but on the other side of the street, bodies were pulled from the rubble of an attack and loaded onto flatbed trucks. On another street a rocket tore a V-shape through a street wall as smoke filled the air. Other video contains images of the wounded -- sometimes bleeding, sometimes bandaged -- and schools and homes that have been bombed. On Wednesday, Danny spoke via Skype. Wearing headphones and locked in a white-walled room, he showed off a mortar that had landed nearby: "We are human beings, we're like animals being killed here. ... I am scared a rocket might land in this room and kill me. "Women and children have got used to seeing blood and body parts in the street. They are really afraid. "The Syrian army is surrounding Babr Ama with army troops and tanks and anti-aircraft. They have been bombarding us with rockets. "There are snipers all around these buildings. Anyone who tries to come up the street will get shot. We always walk along the wall so the sniper does not see us." In video dispatches posted on YouTube, Danny showed a military vehicle he said was captured by rebel fighters, civilians living in cramped rooms, bodies carpeting floors -- and his own growing desperation. Survivors are trapped, dodging snipers and heavy arms fire from tanks surrounding the city, and waiting to see if the army advances. The rebel Free Syrian Army -- containing soldiers who defected from Assad's military to join the rebels -- is unable to fight back because government forces are striking from outside the city beyond the range of their small arms, Abu Rami said. "Who's going to resist? You can't see anything, so there is not any armed resistance in these areas," he said. Parts of the city are without power. Sometimes the security forces shut down electricity and telecommunications networks ahead of early morning raids to root out opposition members. "If you're in a place where they cut off the power or the phones, you know you're in trouble," Abu Rami said. There is a shortage of everything from children's milk formula to oil for heating, and he says security forces are preventing medical aid from reaching dying citizens. Standing in a shelled street, Danny yells into his camera: "Where's the U.N.?, where's the humanity, where is America?"

A major humanitarian crisis is unfolding in northern Sri Lanka with 250,000 unprotected civilians trapped in the crossfire between government troops and rebel forces, the Red Cross says. A civilian, injured during fighting in rebel territory, lies on a bed at a hospital in Vavuniya on January 16, 2009. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has appealed to both sides to facilitate the movement of civilians out of the combat zone which has seen intensified fighting. "People are being caught in the crossfire, hospitals and ambulances have been hit by shelling and several aid workers have been injured while evacuating the wounded," Jacques de Maio, ICRC head of operations for South Asia in Geneva said in a statement on the ICRC Web site." The violence is preventing the ICRC from operating in the region. In the capital, Colombo, Indian foreign affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee huddled Wednesday with Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa on the potential humanitarian crisis. "The Sri Lankan government has reassured that they would respect the safe zones and minimize the effects of conflict on Tamil civilians," Mukherjee said. His discussions with Rajapaksa also envisioned a post-civil war Sri Lanka. "We will work together with the government of Sri Lanka to enable all Sri Lankans, and particularly the Tamil community who have borne the brunt of the effects of the conflict, to lead normal lives as soon as possible," Mukherjee said. But for now, the ICRC says hundreds of patients are in need of emergency treatment and evacuation to Vavuniya Hospital in the government-controlled area and has urged that humanitarian assistance be unhampered in the Vanni region. "When the dust settles, we may see countless victims and a terrible humanitarian situation, unless civilians are protected and international humanitarian law is respected in all circumstances," Maio said. "It's high time to take decisive action and stop further bloodshed because time is running out." Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has also called for the safety of civilians as humanitarian groups try to provide aid to people trapped in the region. "The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of civilians caught in intensified fighting in the Vanni region of Sri Lanka," a spokesman for Ban said in a statement Monday. Ban called on the government and the separatist Tamil Tigers to respect "no-fire zones" and civilians areas, including schools, hospitals and humanitarian posts. He also asked both sides to allow civilians trapped in the fighting to move to "safe areas." Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold in a surprise attack Sunday, even as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians.  Watch a report on the recent fighting » "It's an incredibly serious situation," James Elder, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday. "We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone." Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. "Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track," Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday. "This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years," the Sri Lanka Army chief said. There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has said it has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. "The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally," Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. "They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had."
Mitt Romney -- has held steady in first or second place for the past three years. Meanwhile tea party Republicans have bounced from Sarah Palin to Donald Trump to Michele Bachmann to Rick Perry to (now) Herman Cain, transfixing the media every time they lose faith in one messiah and search for another. Yet sooner or later, the tea party Republicans must converge on a single choice. When they do, they will present the non-tea party Republicans with a troubling menu of possibilities. Possibility 1: Romney is nominated, Romney is elected. From the point of view of non-tea party Republicans, this is the ideal outcome of the 2012 election. Yet it is also an outcome that looks worryingly out of reach. As we enter the final 12 months of the election countdown, Romney still cannot rise above 30% support in his own party. Worse, while it's easy to imagine (say) Herman Cain's voters shifting to Rick Perry or vice versa, it is very hard to imagine where Mitt Romney will find the additional Republican votes he needs. Possibility 2:  Romney is nominated, Romney loses. For non-tea party Republicans, this second outcome opens all kinds of ugly, ominous possibilities. If candidate Romney loses, tea party Republicans will claim that the GOP lost because it failed to nominate a "true conservative." That claim may fly in the face of political math (how would a more extreme candidate win more votes?), but it will pack a lot of emotional punch. Intense partisans are always ready to believe that the way to win is to be more intense and more partisan. Back-to-back losses under John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 will open the way to an ultra-conservative nominee in 2016 -- and a true party debacle. Possibility 3: A tea party Republican is nominated and loses. From the point of view of a non-tea party Republican, the third possibility is the most tragic waste. A winnable election will be thrown away on an ideological adventure. Yet within the disaster might lurk a silver lining. At least the GOP will get the ideological adventure out of its system. For three years, Republican activists have lived in a fantasy world in which fringe characters like Sarah Palin and Herman Cain somehow "speak for the common sense of the common people." It seems incredible that anybody could believe such a thing. It seems crazy that anyone would actually need a presidential election to disabuse them of such notions. But as Benjamin Franklin said: "Experience is a hard teacher, but fools will have no other." Possibility 4: A tea party Republican is nominated and wins. This possibility has to be reckoned the most unlikely. But it cannot be excluded as utterly impossible, on two conditions: If the U.S. economy continues as weak and sick as it is today, and; If tea party Republicans revert from the utterly unelectable Herman Cain to Rick Perry, who as governor of Texas possesses at least the paper qualifications for the presidency. Then - who knows? - anything might happen. Perry would be a much weaker candidate than Romney, but if the voters are determined to fire the incumbent, then even a weak challenger can prevail. (See Barack Hussein Obama, 2008 candidacy of.) In which case, not only tea party Republicans but all Republicans and all Americans will confront the problem: what next? The tea party stands for a series of propositions that don't meet the reality test: that deficits matter more than jobs, that cutting deficits and tightening credit will accelerate economic growth, that high taxes and over-regulation are the most important reasons that growth has not revived, and that America still offers the world's best opportunity for the poor to rise. Tea party plans call for a radical shift in the burden of taxation from the rich to the poor -- and promise big reductions in government spending without touching any of the benefits of current retirees. If put into practice, the tea party platform is a formula for political and economic crisis. Fortunately, it remains a long-shot outcome. If you're betting the odds, you want to put your money on possibility three. As for possibility one -- that's just good government. And nobody seems to get much excited about that these days.
Attacks in January and February by Sudanese forces on Darfur villagers are described in a U.N. report as "violations of international humanitarian and human rights law." Between January and February, Sudanese forces killed 115 people -- including women, children and elderly -- in air and ground attacks on four Darfur villages, according to the report.  Prepared by the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur, the report says attacks in January and February point to a deliberate plan to destroy civilian infrastructure. Helicopter gunships and fixed-wing aircraft targeted the villages while armed militias rode in on horses and camels to force about 30,000 people from their homes, according to the report. The attacks were "carried out during a major military push by the Sudanese government to regain control of West Darfur's northern corridor, and drive out an insurgent group," it said. The village of Saraf Jidad, Sudan, was attacked three times in January, while the villages of Sirbal, Silea and Abu Suruj were attacked within hours of each other on February 8, UNAMID said in the report. The militias and the Sudanese armed forces looted, vandalized and burned homes, schools, shops, community centers and other buildings in the villages, the report said. Sometimes, buildings were burned with people inside, it said. The attacks "amount to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law," they said. "The scale of destruction of civilian property, including objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, suggests that the damage was a deliberate and integral part of a military strategy." The Sudanese government had no immediate response. However, last week, Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir accused the international media of "exaggerating" the situation in Darfur to detract from atrocities in Iraq, the Palestinian territories and Somalia. He said the crisis in Darfur is a "media fabrication" and that in most of the region there is little or no conflict and people are living normal lives, he said. Citing Sudanese government statistics, el-Bashir said fewer than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and fewer than 500,000 have been displaced. International figures, including U.N. data, put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000, with another 2.5 million people displaced. The conflict began five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms, complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government. Sudan's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing tribal militias known as Janjaweed, which have allegedly committed the worst atrocities against Darfur's local communities. Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the United Nations of widespread human rights abuses. El-Bashir rejects claims that the Darfur conflict is being fought along ethnic lines. At the start of this year, more than 9,000 UNAMID peacekeeping troops were deployed to the region to address the fighting and humanitarian suffering. Plans are for the force to eventually number 26,000. E-mail to a friend
A 7-year old Michigan boy took a 20-mile drive in his stepfather's car, ending in a high-speed chase with local law enforcement, according to the Huron County Sheriff's office. Around 10 a.m. Monday, 911 dispatchers received multiple calls reporting what appeared to be a young child driving a red Pontiac across town. "Uh, yes, I'm on Kinde Road outside of Caseville, and believe it or not, I just passed about a 5-, 6-year-old kid flying down the road with a red Pontiac Sunbird," one caller told the dispatcher as he tried to follow the speeding car. Eventually, the caller lost sight of the boy. According to Huron County Sheriff Kelly J. Hanson, the car was seen again minutes later in Caseville by another man who called 911. It was racing past a Dairy Queen restaurant. Based on details provided by 911 dispatchers, Huron County Sheriff's Deputy Randy Britt and Caseville Police Chief Jamie Learman began searching for the car. Hanson said Britt and Learman caught up to the young driver and attempted to stop the car, which officials said was driven as fast as 50 mph. The boy appeared to have difficulty pulling over and footage from Britt's dashboard camera shows the officers eventually had to box the car in to slow it down. According to Hanson, though stopped, the car was still running and in gear. The boy was upset, he said, and couldn't unlock the car door. Finally, officers were able to calm the child and get the door open. Britt put the vehicle in park. "It was learned that the child had left his residence in his stepfather's vehicle, which is in the Sheridan Township area. He was heading for his father's residence in the Filion area," said Hanson. "Deputy Britt called the child's mother and got her voicemail. She quickly returned the call and was unaware that her son was missing. Apparently, she had worked a night shift and had left instructions with the boy to be awakened at 10:00 a.m." A deputy brought the mother to the car and her frightened son, where deputies arranged for them to go to the county Department of Human Services. "We're waiting to hear back from DHS to see how to proceed if we need to, if there is any trouble in the home, any neglect," Hanson said. "We won't release the parents' names until DHS has decided what to do, so we don't interfere with possible court proceedings." No charges have been filed against the boy or his mother. According to Timothy J. Rutkowski, prosecuting attorney for the Huron County Prosecutor's Office, "We're still in the process of looking over the report."
Playing an anxiety-filled mobster made him famous, but it was the beloved, talented man stars and politicians turned out to bid farewell to on Thursday. A funeral service was held for James Gandolfini at The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York City where his friends, family, fans and co-stars came together to mourn the loss of the 51-year-old actor, who died of a heart attack while in Italy on June 20. "The Sopranos" creator David Chase was scheduled to speak during the service, along with Gandolfini's widow, Deborah Lin Gandolfini, and two family friends. Gandolfini found fame starring as mob boss Tony Soprano on Chase's hit HBO series. See James Gandolfini's 1989 screen debut Cast members from that show, including Lorraine Bracco and Tony Sirico, embraced others as they arrived. Spectators stood nearby as they watched a wide range of well-knowns enter the church, from actor Alec Baldwin to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. In addition to the remembrances by family and friends, the 90-minute service was to include traditional hymns and contemporary selections, according to HBO. The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine was selected because it is large enough to accommodate the multitude of family, friends and fans expected to attend, an HBO representative said. Despite reports the network planned to film the funeral, "HBO is not recording it. It is being recorded for personal archival usage," a spokesperson from that company told CNN. James Gandolfini's last roles The service followed a private wake held Wednesday at a funeral home in Park Ridge, New Jersey, the New York Daily News reported. The invitation-only event drew tearful family and friends who grappled with their loss. "It's a nightmare for the whole family," Bob Price, who is married to one of Gandolfini's cousins, told the Daily News. "It's a horrible, horrible thing. Everybody is just devastated." Wednesday evening, Broadway dimmed its lights in memory of the actor, who was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009 for his work in the play "God of Carnage."
including the old, abducting women, and children and burning homes," ‎Kamale said Tuesday. He said villages are littered with bodies, and there is no one to bury them because residents have fled -- thousands of them, heading off into the mountains or across the border into Cameroon -- to escape the onslaught. "They slaughter people like animals," he said. ‎"Now, 70% of the people in the district have been dislodged from the homes. Some of them have run into the mountains, while others have crossed into Cameroon or fled to Yola," the capital of Adamawa state, Kamale said. The villagers' ordeal is horrific but, sadly, nothing new for Boko Haram. The terrorist group, its name translating as "Western education is sin," has been a force in Nigeria for years. It tries to use religion to justify its actions, which are aimed at imposing its strict version of of Sharia law in Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram has intensified its attacks in recent years, standing defiant against the Nigerian military. And it hasn't gone after only government troops or officials, with civilians often becoming victims. The group has been tied to a spate of assassinations, market bombings, attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques and raids of villages, including those earlier this month in Michika district. Mass kidnappings have also been part of its playbook, most notoriously the taking of more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok last April. Boys and young men have been abducted as well, including 40 between the ages of 10 and 23 reportedly taken captive on New Year's Eve in Borno state, and 97 others kidnapped in and around the village of Doron Baga in August. And whether or not they were former captives, Boko Haram may be boasting about its use of child soldiers in its fight. An organization calling itself Boko Haram's official mouthpiece this week even promoted an alleged military training camp for children on its Twitter feed, posting images of children in formation holding AK-47 weapons. While CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the photos, intelligence sources said the images appear to be real and are consistent with the Islamist extremist group's strategy of forcibly recruiting and training children. And the U.S. State Department lent credibility to the report by tweeting a photo of the young, heavily armed children along with these words: "Amid its massacres of innocents, Boko Haram running training camps for child soldiers." The release of these photos and the new Twitter account appear to coincide with an ever-more sophisticated media strategy on the part of Boko Haram.  The change in  tactics appears to emulate ISIS, even down to the use of Islamic chants, or nasheeds. Last week, a video was posted on the same account purporting to be an interview with Boko Haram's spokesman. Both the interviewer and the subject were masked and the production values were  far more sophisticated than anything the terror group has published before. Boko Haram's campaign has left thousands of Nigerians in danger -- in some cases with the central government and others seemingly unable to help. The latest bloodshed began in Michika township, which Boko Haram took over in September and declared to be part of its caliphate. The insurgents then moved into villages including Murva, Bororo, Ghumci, Garta-Kasa, Kamale, Boka, Futu and Kwabaride‎. Humanitarian workers have been unable to reach residents who fled into the mountains, said Mohammed Kanar, head of the National Emergency Management Agency for northeast Nigeria. "We are aware there are people trapped in the mountains but they are inaccessible. The security situation is a challenge in reaching them and offering them humanitarian assistance," Kanar said. Kamale said the military has not responded to complaints that he and other community leaders lodged, calling for its intervention. "Sometimes we alert the military when they are advancing on villages before they attack, but no action is taken to stop them," he said. "These insurgents have been killing with impunity. When they attack a village, they will sleep there for the night after the slaughter and move on the next morning," the lawmaker said. There has been no reaction from the military to Kamale's specific allegation. Amnesty International on Wednesday leveled a similar accusation, saying it had evidence that the Nigerian military was warned repeatedly about impending Boko Haram attacks on civilians late last year on Bogo and Monguno. "These attacks are an urgent wake-up call for the Nigerian leadership, the African Union and the international community," said Amnesty's Netsanet Belay. "It is essential to protect hundreds of thousands of civilians in northeast Nigeria from Boko Haram's continued onslaught." The Nigerian Defense Ministry responded by calling the allegation "misleading," saying that Amnesty's use of "these unfortunate activities of terrorists to find fault with the counterterrorism operations, as usual, is inaccurate and unfair." The Defense Ministry said its forces have enhanced their intelligence abilities, troop deployment and coordination, and logistics capabilities. "In actual fact, the protection of civilian populations is the essence of the entire counterterrorism operation," the ministry said. "... Indeed, the troops were prepared and duly engaged the terrorists in all the instances referred to by Amnesty International." Journalist  Aminu Abubakar reported from Nigeria, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.
The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Samantha Power as the next ambassador to the United Nations. The confirmation, by a 87-10 vote, was lauded by President Barack Obama. "As one of our country's leading foreign policy thinkers, Samantha knows that our nation's interests are advanced with strong and principled American leadership," Obama said in a statement. Power worked for Obama's campaign in 2008 until she resigned after referring to Hillary Clinton -- the other leading Democratic contender at the time -- as a "monster." Prior to the confirmation, Power was senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council and a former special assistant to the president. Power also has written extensively on preventing genocide, with criticism of the United Nations for failing to stop attacks in Bosnia and Rwanda.
Go west, young man! This historic clichÃ© still resonates when it comes to road trips. But whether it's bombing to the Bay Area along the often dull-as-dirt I-80 or trying to find traces of iconic Route 66 amid a tangle of bland Interstates, the old paradigm of thinking horizontal when planning a road trip is simply not the way to go. Many of the best and most interesting roads in the U.S. run north to south, crossing the nation's striations and taking you from northern weather and cultures to entirely different ones down south. As a bonus these roads pack a lot into routes that are often shorter than the east-west standbys. New York to San Francisco is about 2900 miles by the most direct route, snoozy I-80. But Chicago to Miami on the legendary US 41 through Nashville is only 1400 miles and a thrilling journey from start to finish. Often overlooked, the old national highways (with route numbers proceeded by 'US') offer some incredible north-south journeys. At times the routes disappear under modern interstates but these are mere interruptions in authentic journeys of discovery and adventure. Here are some favorites. Lonely Planet: How to survive a boring road trip US 1 (2400 miles) One of the great American road trips, this fabled road starts at the Canadian border in Maine and goes all the way south to the tip of the nation in Key West, Florida. Along the way it traverses 15 states, including 12 of the original 13 colonies. It hugs Connecticut's shore, razors across New York City, crosses Washington DC and hits the old south at Richmond, Va. Its rural meanderings in Georgia pass towns little changed in decades before it joins the balmy Atlantic coast in Florida and follows the beaches all the way through Miami and on to the Keys. Summer Travel: 10 best motorcycle roads in the U.S. US 41 (2000 miles) From the tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where Lakes Superior and Michigan bracket the road, US 41 follows the latter lake down the coast of Wisconsin and into Chicago. There it veers southeast and wanders through the dense woods of Indiana and Kentucky, which abound in pioneer sites, especially ones linked to Abraham Lincoln. In Tennessee, the highlight is Nashville, the music city, before the road bounces down to Atlanta. In Florida US 41 links the resort towns of the Gulf Coast before cutting due east through the heart of the Everglades to Miami. Lonely Planet: The planet's ultimate drives US 61 (1400 miles) From a start in the lake-dotted prairies just north of Minneapolis-St Paul, US 61 stays with the Mississippi River through Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri, where it passes through Mark Twain country in Hannibal and the urban pleasures of St Louis. Continuing south through rural Arkansas and Tennessee, the route earns its legendary moniker 'the Blues Highway' as it follows the sinuous course of the mighty Mississippi through its namesake state's Delta Region. Crossing into Louisiana, US 61 ends fittingly at the blues clubs and other myriad pleasures of New Orleans. Summer Travel: Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf Coast US 83 (1900 miles) The sleeper of great US roads, US 83 is anything but a snooze, especially if you want hundreds of miles of driving through wide-open spaces, often little changed since the last Conestoga wagon passed through. From Manitoba to Mexico, the route runs near-arrow-straight south through North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. The skies are big, the vistas wide and the small towns offer respite from chain-filled Interstate interchanges. In Texas, the beautiful Hill Country is a highlight before the road hits the troubled yet fascinating Mexican border at Laredo and follows the Rio Grande River to Brownsville. Lonely Planet: Top 10 places to view the golden gate bridge US 89 (1250 miles) No US highway hits more iconic national parks than US 89, starting with Glacier near the Canadian border in Montana. Hugging the east side of the Rocky Mountains it passes Yellowstone at the Wyoming border and then drops down behind the iconic Grand Teton. In Utah it passes the mineral-laced waters of the Great Salt Lake and in the south cuts between Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks. Over the line in Arizona is the biggest spectacle of all, the Grand Canyon. Although US 89 officially ends at Flagstaff, you can follow its original route south through Tucson and Saguaro National Park to Nogales and the Mexican border. US 101 (1500 miles) Easily one of the most famous American highways, a journey along US 101 is the reason for many a trip. The road starts on the Olympic Peninsula across Puget Sound from Seattle. Then it curves around to the Pacific, which it never strays far from all the way south. The views become spectacular at Astoria, Oregon and never diminish as you pass the giant redwoods of Northern California right until San Francisco. Although many people opt for Hwy 1 south of here, staying with US 101 takes you through Steinbeck Country and Salinas and on past the historic 17th century Spanish missions that once lined what was then called the El Camino Real. At Paso Robles, hundreds of wineries vie for attention before the highway encounters the beautiful Southern California coast and follows the beaches through Santa Barbara. Further on it picks up the evocative name Hollywood Freeway and ends near downtown Los Angeles. Originally published as "America's Best North-South Roads" Â© 2012 Lonely Planet.

A former mining tycoon accused of running a "mafia-style" gang to amass billions of dollars in personal wealth has gone on trial in China, facing charges including murder, state media reports. Liu Han was former board chairman of the Sichuan Hanlong Group, the largest private enterprise in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, with interests including mining, real estate, electricity, energy and finance. He also holds major stake in a number of Australian companies. Official Chinese news sources estimate his wealth, which was seized with his arrest, as in the "tens of billions of yuan," or billions of U.S. dollars. The 48-year old, who was detained last year along with younger brother Liu Wei on suspicion of criminal activities, has been charged with a raft of crimes, including murder, financial crimes, operating casinos and gun-running, according to state news agency Xinhua. The trial against the brothers and 34 of their associates began in Xianning Intermediate People's Court in Hubei Province Monday, when a photograph of Liu Han in the court's dock, flanked by policemen, was published on social media networks by state news agencies. Details of the charges against the alleged gang -- including nine murder charges -- were carried in a Xinhua report in February. Gang of thugs According to the report, the Liu brothers started out running gambling centers in their base in Guanghan, China's southern Sichuan Province, in the early 1990s, gathering around them "a gang of local thugs and vagrants." The report said the brothers' empire grew, before finally attracting the attention of central authorities with an alleged public shooting at a Guanghan teahouse one afternoon in January, 2009, supposedly directed at an underworld rival. According to the report, the two suspects detained over the attack, which killed three and injured two, allegedly identified Liu Wei as having ordered the attack. Liu Han also developed a reputation as a philanthropist, building a rural school campus following a 2008 earthquake that devastated Sichuan Province. His brother also had a reputation for charity, and had been a torch-bearer in the build-up to the Beijing Olympics, also in 2008, according to Xinhua. Anti-corruption purge Large numbers of senior Communist Party officials are reportedly attending the trial, which is being closely watched for any signs of links to a potential investigation into former senior official Zhou Yongkang. The 71-year old was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, before he retired in 2012, and previously served as the czar of China's domestic security apparatus, and as the party chief in Sichuan from 1999 to 2002. Speculation has swirled in recent times that Zhou is set to become the next high-profile target of President Xi Jinping's heralded anti-corruption purge. Chinese state media has hinted that Liu Han's alleged gang operated with political connections to central government officials.
A 6-foot-4 football player is more than a million times the size of a typical Staphylococcus bacterium. But under the right conditions, that athlete could find himself defenseless against the microscopic bug. Kellen Winslow recently had a second staph infection and has accused his team of covering it up. The problem came to the forefront last week with Cleveland Browns player Kellen Winslow, who recently had his second staph infection. He is reportedly the sixth player to acquire staph among the Browns in five years. Winslow recently said the Browns treated him like a "piece of meat" when he was hospitalized for the condition, and he claimed they covered up the cause of his illness. After Winslow spoke out, the organization suspended him for one game, then rescinded the suspension after a settlement with Winslow over the weekend. The Browns said in a statement Saturday that the team and Winslow had worked through their differences, and that the team looked forward to his return. Winslow joined the team again Monday. Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts was revealed to have a staph infection, the Indianapolis Star reported Friday. University of North Carolina-Asheville fans also recently learned that Kenny George, the 7-foot-7 center on the basketball team, had a staph infection complication that led to part of his foot being amputated. It's unclear how these high-profile athletes acquired their infections, but locker rooms have been found to habor staph bacteria in previous outbreaks. The topic is generating buzz throughout the sports world as more players' staph cases are revealed. Hospitals have long been known to be hot spots for transmitting staph, but recently cases have cropped up in other community settings. Regardless of where these players got their infections, the close quarters of a locker room raise questions about overall risks. About 30 percent of people carry staph in their noses without exhibiting symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a form of staph resistant to common antibiotics, has become a more prevalent problem in settings such as contact sports that involve skin-to-skin touching. Most MRSA infections acquired in community settings present themselves as sores or boils and often appear red, swollen, painful or with drainage such as pus, the CDC says. Infections often occur in cuts and abrasions but also on body parts covered in hair, such as the back of the neck, armpit or groin. Schools, prisons and other crowded environments are particularly known for transmitting MRSA, said. Elaine Larson, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. MRSA may spread particularly easily among athletes because they have repeated skin-to-skin contact, share items and surfaces that touch skin and have a hard time staying clean, the CDC says. Athletes often get cuts and abrasions; MRSA can enter uncovered skin breaks and cause infection. Dr. James Steinberg, medical director at Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, said that environment plays a role in the spread of MRSA but that it's less a factor than coming into contact with a person's skin. "If you have somebody who has an infection -- he has a draining infection -- and he gets some of his pus on a bench, that staph's going to be there for hours or days before it dries out," he said. "But the higher concentration is going to be on that person's skin." A second infection in the same person could result from re-exposure or from treatment that didn't get rid of the bacteria colonization, he said. MRSA has been around in hospital settings since the 1970s, but community-associated MRSA was born in the late 1990s, and is now widespread in the community, said CDC spokesperson Nicole Coffin. A report from the CDC said that the deaths of four children from MRSA in North Dakota and Minnesota during the late 1990s "demonstrate the potential severity of community-acquired MRSA infections." A study on the St. Louis Rams published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2003 found that during the 2003 football season, there were eight MRSA infections among five of the 58 Rams players. To protect against MRSA, the CDC recommends practicing good personal hygiene and taking care of your skin, which includes wearing protective clothing and covering cuts and abrasions with clean, dry bandages. Also, do not share items that come into contact with your skin, such as towels, razors and ointments. Put something between your skin and shared equipment -- for example, sit on a towel on a bench. Larson said she is not directly familiar with Winslow's situation but understands the dilemma that a team would face if a player contracted a staph infection. There could be economic and psychosocial repercussions -- for example, another team might not want to play against that one, she said. But in general, other team members should be made aware of the situation so they do not share towels or engage in other behaviors that might transmit the infection. Still, there is a danger of overreaction, she said. In some instances when a child in a public school has died, the whole school panicked and fumigated the facility, she said. "It's a good idea to avoid that level of fear, because it's costly and it scares people unnecessarily," she said. On Thursday, the Brown's General Manager Phil Savage said the team did not alert players to Winslow's staph infection partly because of the health privacy laws and partly because the team was in "game mode" when Winslow had a confirmed diagnosis. "To come out and talk about that just was going to be another distraction," Savage said on his regular weekly appearance on WTAM radio in Cleveland, Ohio. "That's our job, is to limit distractions as much as we can." Winslow said in a statement released through his publicist, Denise White of EAG Sports Management, that he had been discouraged from making the issue public. "This has nothing to do with football, and this has nothing to with my current contract situation," he said. "This is a health concern." A spokesperson for the Browns did not return a request for comment. An NFL representative said the league has no statement on the issue.
The historic vessel which provided the setting for Humphrey Bogart's only Oscar winning performance has been resurrected from the scrapheap by a movie-loving Florida couple. The African Queen is a 100 year old steam boat famed for its starring role in the 1951 hit movie of the same name. The classic picture -- which also starred Katharine Hepburn and told the story of a Canadian steam boat captain and a British missionary working in German East Africa during the First World War -- saw Bogart receive the 1951 Academy Award for best actor. After falling into a state of disrepair following the death of its previous owner in 2001, the vessel was spotted gathering rust in a Florida marina late last year by Suzanne Holmquist and her engineer husband, Lance. The couple have since repaired the ailing ship and opened it up to tourists and film enthusiasts, providing cruises around the Florida Keys aboard the famous vessel. See also: Historic vessel Cutty Sark rises from ashes "It's (the boat) held in a trust so we approached them and talked about restoring it," says Holmquist on how she stumbled upon the famous vessel. "We have a tall ship business that operates right next to where the African Queen was stationed in Key Largo. It was just wasting away so we offered to restore it and put it into our charter operation," she adds. Although most famed for its role alongside Bogart and Hepburn, the African Queen had a long and colorful life before hitting the big screen, explains Holmquist. Built in 1912 at Lytham Shipbuilding Yard in England, the vessel was originally named the Livingstone and served as a cargo vessel for the British East Africa Rail Company. It spent most of its first 50 years operating in the waters of the Ruki River in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo where she was used to transport a mixture of hunters, mercenaries and cargo. In the early 1950's the ship was spotted by the director of the African Queen, John Huston, and pulled temporarily from service so it could be used in the movie. See also: HMS Victory gets $25 million revamp By the late 1960's however, the African Queen had swapped the big screen and the rural hinterland of the Congo for the concrete jungle of San Francisco. An American businessman transported the ship to the Golden Gate city where he hoped to harness its Hollywood fame to operate it as a tour boat. This idea proved unsuccessful however and the vessel then changed hands a number of times before coming to the attention of Florida attorney and Humphrey Bogart enthusiast, Jim Hendricks Sr. in 1982. Hendricks Sr. eagerly snapped up his very own chunk Bogart movie memorabilia which he owned until his death in 2001. During this period Hendricks Sr. took the African Queen around the world, gracing flotillas that marked the 50th anniversary of the battle of Dunkirk in the English Channel and the Queen Mother's 90th birthday on the River Thames. Once Hendricks Sr. passed away however, the vessel once more fell upon hard times, wasting away on a lonely jetty in southern Florida. It was here that Suzanne Holmquist, herself a self-confessed Bogart and Hepburn buff recognized the boat. Late last year she made an offer to the owners to put it back in working order. "It had big holes in it and was kind of like a sieve when it rained, all the water was just pouring out," says Holmquist. "My husband has restored big boats before, some bigger than this one, so I knew that we could do it," she adds. The ensuing restoration project has been a detailed and thorough process taking fully six months to complete. See also: Tourism at the bottom of the deep blue sea The hull has been equipped with a new steel frame, a replacement boiler has been installed and the original black African mahogany wood decks have been repainted. In order to maintain the boats worn and rustic charm however, Holmquist says it has been splattered with mud so as to make it look exactly like it does in the movie. "Most of the interest so far in boat has come from movie fans ... so we wanted it to make it look as much like it does in the film as possible," says Holmquist. The ship has even had a special guest visitor in the shape of Humphrey Bogart's son, Stephen, who gave the freshly completed restoration efforts his blessing. But by using the African Queen's Hollywood past to draw people aboard, Holmquist also hopes to provide visitors with an understanding of the ship's rich history beyond the silver screen. This a story Holmquist herself says she has been fascinated to discover over the course of the past few months. "I knew it was famous from the movie but as time has gone on I've found out a lot more about the history of it and where she has been," says Holmquist. "Hopefully we'll be able to relay that story and all those who come to visit can learn a little more about the boat and her incredible life," she adds.
and then died there. Exactly what spurred Douglas McAuthur McCain's metamorphosis remains murky. But while his radicalization and death have stunned loved ones back home, his actions abroad have raised fears that other Americans may follow suit. Here's what we know about the 33-year-old man who died while fighting for ISIS, the radical militant group that has captured swaths of Iraq and Syria and spawned major concerns in the United States: U.S. on alert amid new claim of American killed in Syria He grew up in Minnesota McCain grew up in the Minneapolis suburb of New Hope, his friend Isaac Chase said. The two lived in the same New Hope apartment building and became fast friends. "When I first moved here, I didn't know anyone, so I went to the park and I would see him and his brother and a bunch of other people playing basketball, and he asked me if I wanted to play," Chase said. "We just hung out pretty much from 10 o'clock in the morning all the way until nighttime. We'd just play basketball and talk. ... He was an older guy that I looked up to. He was actually a good dude." Chase remembers McCain as a nice, quiet young man, but one who was looking for purpose in life. When Chase joined the Air Force in 2007 and served in Iraq, McCain was impressed that his friend was making something of his life and wanted to do the same, Chase said. But after learning that McCain died while fighting for ISIS, which is trying to establish an Islamic state across Iraq and Syria, his friend was bewildered. "It just hurts a little bit knowing that if he was over there and I was over there at the same time, we would've been going against each other," Chase said. "That's what hurts the most because he was a good person, and I just don't understand why anyone would do anything to the U.S." His family is stunned And he was raised by good parents, Chase added. He said McCain's mother attended church regularly, while the father is deceased. Ken McCain described the nephew he knew as "a good person, loved his family, loved his mother, loved his faith" -- the latter being a reference to Christianity he practiced before his conversion to Islam several years ago. Opinion: When Americans leave for jihad The family wasn't alarmed by his conversion. But McCain's Facebook posts sympathetic to ISIS got relatives' attention, the uncle said. "We are devastated, and we are just as surprised as the country is," Ken McCain said of the news his nephew had become a jihadi in Syria. But not every family member believes Douglas McCain joined ISIS, a group with tactics so brutal even al Qaeda has disowned it. "We're from Chicago. We grew up in Minnesota," his cousin Kenyata McCain told CNN affiliate KARE. "He's not a terrorist. That's crazy." "His religion was very important to him, but those people -- the ISIS people -- they don't represent what my cousin's beliefs are or were at all." Kenyata McCain -- who said Douglas commented about her sons growing up on a Facebook photo a few days before his death -- wondered if her cousin may have gotten caught up in the wrong crowd. "Why was he in Syria? ... What kind of people was he hanging around? I feel like maybe it was the people he was hanging out with because that's not who he is. He's not ISIS," she said. Spent time in California, Sweden, Turkey Douglas McCain didn't take a straight path from Minnesota to Syria, from Christianity to an extreme brand of Islam, from "good person" to accused terrorist. Physically, he moved around some as well. That includes time in Southern California, where he attended San Diego City College, according to spokesman Jack Beresford. At the beginning of this decade, McCain also spent time in Sweden. An acquaintance of his in that Scandinavian nation, Kevin Tornstrom Kohlin, remembers him as "a really good basketball player" and a "fun guy who spread a lot of good energy." "I never noticed him giving any bad energy, at all, to anybody," Kohlin said from Vasteras, Sweden. "Everybody who met him, of those I know, remember him the same way." McCain appeared to have no problem with anyone's religion -- including that of Kohlin, who is Christian. While all his stops aren't publicly known, uncle Ken McCain did say that his nephew was in Turkey when he last touched base with him a few months ago. Not coincidentally, Turkey borders Syria. From hip-hop dancer to jihadist: How dad tracked down son in Syria U.S. government had been monitoring him McCain had several run-ins with local law enforcement in Minnesota since 2000, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. These include arrests for disorderly conduct, speeding, driving after revocation, theft by swindle and giving an officer false information. And in 2003, he paid a $250 fine after pleading guilty to having marijuana in a motor vehicle, according to court records. Still, these were minor issues, certainly not matters of national security. In the early 2000s, though, Douglas McCain did come to the federal government's attention, according to a U.S. official. He was associated over the years with numerous people who authorities were watching -- including one from Minnesota who ended up dying in Somalia while fighting as a jihadi -- the official said. But there was no indication that McCain was involved in anything nefarious during his time in the Midwest. Things changed, though, as the years went by. U.S. counterterrorism investigators had been looking into his activities for some time before his death, a U.S. official said. McCain was on a list of Americans who are believed to have joined militant groups and who would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if he traveled. It's not clear when McCain got on that list. Moreover, U.S. authorities did not learn that he was in Turkey until he was already there, according to a U.S. official. How and why he moved on to Syria, how and why he became a jihadist and joined ISIS, befuddles those who knew him back in the United States. Some clues about his final days, weeks and months may lie in a Twitter account reported to be that of McCain's. A June 9 message read: "I will be joining you guys soon." He followed up the next day, "I'm with the brothers now." Then came this perhaps telling retweet, on June 26: "It takes a warrior to understand a warrior. "Pray for ISIS." Who is the ISIS? How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda
Meet Bailey. She's a registered therapy dog, but you won't find her in hospitals or nursing homes. Instead, Bailey makes weekly visits to libraries and schools. She sits quietly or snuggles up to kids as they read her a book. And no, she's not napping, and the kids don't have treats in their pockets. She's actually helping these children learn to read. It sounds implausible. After all, dogs can't read. How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working. The philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference. Kathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence. "A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story," she says. "They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog." Video: Meet Bailey and Wilmoth The children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher. "One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog," says Klotz. "Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together." Bailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the "Sit. Stay. Read." program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States. "The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time," says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. "It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system." iReport.com: Wilmoth explains how he and Bailey got started And then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading. For older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs. "A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely," she explains. "They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it." It's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids. "It's not just reading scores," she says. "They start to speak up in class, and volunteer, and finish homework. They don't want to miss school when they're going to read to the dog, so it improves attendance. It kind of just flows over onto everything." R.E.A.D. staff and volunteers know people are skeptical about the program's results at first, but Klotz says anyone who's spent time with a dog will understand. "It sounds a little kooky when people first hear the idea," she admits. "But if they know dogs at all, and the way people relate to dogs, it quickly starts to make sense. But you don't quite ever grasp how really lovely it is until you see it happen and you see the kids light up and you see how excited they are. You see all these changes in them that they just weren't able to make."
A 46-year-old man from Austin, Texas, died Sunday during the swim portion of the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon in San Francisco, according to race officials. "We have reason to believe the gentleman suffered from a massive cardiac event as he entered the water and began the swim," race director Bill Burke said in a statement. "Water safety noticed him immediately and initiated CPR while he was in the water and as they transferred him to land," he added. Burke said he believes the man's death marks the first in the triathlon's 33-year history. "The thoughts and prayers of the entire Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon team are with the family and friends of the racer as they mourn this loss," he said. The statement did not identify the triathlete who died. 'A lot of people seemed to be having trouble on the swim' The race, which took place in June last year, was scheduled earlier this year to accommodate the 2013 America's Cup. The change in date meant athletes competed in colder conditions. Approximately 2,000 people take part in the race each year, according to the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon website. The competition includes a 1.5 mile swim from Alcatraz Island, an 18-mile bike race and an 8-mile run. Alcatraz Island, in the San Francisco Bay, is known for a high-security prison that operated there for some 30 years before closing in 1963. Officially, no one ever escaped from Alcatraz, but a handful of prisoners who attempted to escape were never found and remain listed as "missing and presumed drowned," according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
A soldier being examined for possible post-traumatic stress disorder buys a gun off base and fails to register it with a commander, as required. Now Spc. Ivan Lopez is dead, along with three others, in the second major shooting at Fort Hood in less than five years. Changes implemented after the 2009 massacre in which Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured dozens resulted in a better response by military police to Wednesday's incident at the sprawling Texas military base, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told a Senate panel. However, few immediate answers emerged about how the military can prevent someone undergoing psychiatric evaluation from illegally bringing a firearm on base. It is one of several recurring security questions involving military bases, particularly Fort Hood, the nation's largest Army base and scene of the 2009 attack as well as the 2011 arrest of an Army private who tried to build a bomb to blow up troops stationed there. "Something went wrong" "As we watched some of the events unfold yesterday, we saw some of the benefits and gains made out of that first Fort Hood experience," Army Secretary John McHugh told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday. "But something happened, something went wrong, and we need to know what that was." The problem is not limited to Fort Hood. Last year, a gunman with access to the Washington Navy Yard in the nation's capital killed 12 people before police shot him to death. Steps taken in response to the 2009 Fort Hood shootings included creating a kind of "neighborhood watch" to teach the Army community to recognize and report suspicious behavior, as well as plans to educate commanders on signs of workplace violence, and an enhanced 911 system. Fort Hood shooting spree Odierno said training for how to respond to a live shooter situation, including alert procedures, helped prevent Wednesday's violence from being "much, much worse." A resident at the base, Lynn Adams, said authorities check identification and other things, but overall, "there hasn't been a whole lot of extra protection on base" in the aftermath of the 2009 killings. After Wednesday's latest Fort Hood shootings, military and security analysts distinguished between the specific issue of security at the Army base and the broader debate over federal and state gun control laws. Lopez legally purchased a .45 caliber handgun at a gun store in Killeen, where Fort Hood is located, sources told CNN. He then took the weapon onto the base, which violated military regulations because he didn't register it there. Two issues involved Those are two distinct steps -- one involving background checks of people seeking to buy firearms and the other about security protocols at the base where more than 50,000 people live and work each day, noted former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, CNN's law enforcement analyst. "This is not a U.S. penitentiary," Fuentes said of Fort Hood. "They're not going to search every car, every trunk, pat down every person going through there. It's a city. It's a working city." He also noted the base includes soldiers preparing for combat deployment, meaning "you have an extra percentage of the population that are trained to kill, if you will." Fort Hood shooter was Iraq vet "So this is to be expected," Fuentes said. "We don't want it to happen and we say we're going to do everything to stop it from happening, but we're just fooling ourselves. It's not going to be completely eliminated. There's not everything you can do to completely stop this on military bases or in any other city for that matter." Killeen Mayor Dan Corbin shared that opinion, telling CNN that "there's no way that we could be ... 100% certain that someone doesn't have a gun at Fort Hood." "That's logistically impossible," Corbin added. A 1993 ban on private weapons at military bases got expanded at Fort Hood following the Hasan killings, making Lopez's possession of his handgun on the base illegal. In response to Wednesday's shootings, which also injured 16 people including three critically, Republican Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas called for ending the restrictions. Let soldiers carry weapons on bases? "This is the third mass shooting on a military base in five years, and it's because our trained soldiers aren't allowed to carry defensive weapons," Stockman said. "Anti-gun activists have turned our military bases into soft targets for killers." Odierno, however, said Thursday that the armed military police and other base security personnel provided enough protection. "Although we carry arms quite regularly overseas when we we're deployed on a regular basis, I believe back here in the United States, it's more appropriate that we leave it to that," he said in response to a question from GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Republican Rep. Peter King of New York earlier told CNN that his military experience showed the benefit of preventing ordinary soldiers from having firearms on base. "You have a situation where in a barracks on Saturday night, you may have arguments, fights," King said, adding that military brass should talk to "the sergeants, the NCOs, the officers and people on the ground" about the effect that access to firearms could have on regular order and discipline before making any change. Again, a female cop is a hero at Fort Hood King and others called instead for better screening of possible mental illness among troops, a major issue for the military dealing with the impact of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Lopez had a history of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, and was receiving treatment and taking antidepressants, according to military officials. "At the end of the day, it's not going to be about the gun necessarily, it's going to be about the soldier and the care that he should have gotten that he wasn't getting, or somebody knew," said retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore. "At the bottom, there's a sergeant that knows that there's something wrong with that soldier, that he needed more help. At the bottom of this, there's a captain that knows." Continuity of care CNN Military Analyst James "Spider" Marks, a retired major general, noted that Lopez had been transferred from another military base to Fort Hood two months ago, which broke the continuity of any care he received for his mental issues. "You wouldn't have done that with a soldier who was undergoing some other type of physical, visible ailment. You would have left that young soldier where he or she was," Marks said, adding that "I think that is a part of this process that needs to be evaluated as well." Odierno said the Army does "quite significant screening today, but it doesn't mean it's right and it doesn't mean we can't improve it." "We have to constantly evaluate this," he told the Senate panel. "This is something that we are going to have to deal with for a very long period of time, and that's the consequence of 13 years of war." What is it about Fort Hood? The broader issue of U.S. gun laws raises more volatile and irreconcilable differences. "This is yet another story, a person with psychiatric problems walking into a gun shop and being able to obtain a weapon and ammunition and go shoot who he wants," Fuentes said. "There's no indication of any political will to change that situation, so we'll just have to deal with it as it comes." To emphasize his point, he noted how proposals for tougher gun laws failed to pass Congress after the 2012 killings in Connecticut of 20 first-graders and six educators by a 20-year-old man with known mental health issues who had access to family firearms. "If a massacre of children doesn't change situations like that, this certainly won't," Fuentes said. Gun control debate However, Republican Rep. John Carter of Texas called the state's current system of background checks adequate, and Corbin, the Killeen mayor, warned that increasing restrictions could cause unintended consequences. "If we impose restrictions on the ability to carry or get a concealed handgun permit because someone is starting to seek help for problems they have, that could serve as a disincentive and keep people from seeking treatment," Corbin told CNN. A CNN/ORC International poll in November, as the first anniversary of the Connecticut school shootings approached, showed the nation evenly split on the issue. In Washington, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Thursday that "there's no question that those with mental health issues should be prevented from owning weapons or being able to purchase weapons." He touted funding for pilot programs studying the matter in legislation passed by Congress, calling the issue something "we need to continue to look at to find a way to keep weapons out of the hands of people who should not have them." CNN's Dana Bash, Barbara Starr, Faith Karimi and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.
Mikkel Kessler is the new World Boxing Council (WBC) super-middleweight champion after out-pointing Briton Carl Froch in a bruising encounter in his native Denmark on Saturday night. Despite being previously unbeaten after 26 fights, the 32-year-old Froch never looked comfortable against his durable opponent, who was given the decision on all three of the judges scorecards after 12 brutal rounds in front of a partisan and passionate crowd at the MCH Messecenter in Herning. Froch had Kessler on the canvas in the fifth round, but the referee ruled that the Dane had slipped, and the challenger eventually wore the champion down with a combination of hooks and jabs to take the belt by a margin of 117-111, 115-113 and 116-112. The result means 31-year-old Kessler, who has lost just twice in 45 fights, is a world champion again just five months after losing his World Boxing Association (WBA) title to Andre Ward. Although gracious in defeat, Froch questioned if the decision would have gone Kessler's way if the fight had taken place in his hometown of Nottingham, England. "I feel terrible that I lost my title, absolutely gutted," Froch told ringside reporters after the fight. "I don't want to make a mockery of anything but I feel if it was at home in my town, the decision would have gone the other way." He added: "I took some big punches off a big puncher and I've got to give Kessler the credit he deserves. He stayed in there and is a strong, proud warrior."
Sitting on their front porch in this Houston suburb, Edmond Demiraj and his family seem the picture of a contented family. But the Department of Justice now wants to upend the family: threatening to deport his wife and 19-year-old son back to their native Albania, even though he says federal prosecutors a decade ago promised him help and a Green Card in exchange for Edmond's promised testimony in a human smuggling case against a fellow Albanian immigrant. For the Demiraj family, they believe it will mean great harm, even death, for those deported. A decade ago, Edmond Demiraj (pronounced: dem-EAR-eye) was himself an illegal immigrant. He told CNN he had walked across the U.S. border from Mexico to Brownsville, Texas without any paperwork. He found work as a painter, he says, with a fellow Albanian named Bill Bedini. Not long afterwards, the Justice Department indicted Bedini, accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring, bringing illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Demiraj was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped. Attorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj to testify against Bedini. In exchange, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a Green Card, which would lead to citizenship. The offer, he says, was verbal and not on paper. "I'm ready to work for the U.S. government, whatever they need from me," Demiraj told CNN. But Bedini entered a plea of not guilty, was granted bail and soon fled to Albania, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston. Federal prosecutors didn't need Demiraj's testimony and handed him over to immigration officials, who quickly deported him as well. Within a few weeks back in his native Albania, Demiraj says, Bedini attacked him and tried to kill him. "I was on my knees and he pointed the gun straight at me," Demiraj told CNN. "He shot me." Demiraj says it was only luck that saved him. Neighbors, he said, heard the gunshot and came to his assistance. Bedini fled, leaving Demiraj with a bullet wound in his side and stomach. Demiraj also says Bedini forced three nieces into prostitution in Italy but they were eventually rescued. Demiraj returned once again to the United States, again he says entering illegally at Brownsville. This time, immigration agents apprehended him and he says he spent seven months in an immigration jail before being allowed to remain in the United States on temporary status. That was six years ago. Almost ever since his return to the United States, he says, federal prosecutors have tried to deport his wife, Rodina and son, Rediol, back to Albania. His two other smaller children were born in Texas and are legal residents. "What do you think will happen to your wife and son if they back to Albania,?" Demiraj was asked. "Oh, they're going to be killed. They are going to be killed," he replied. One federal prosecutor agreed, saying in an appellate court argument that "there is a possibility that Mrs. Demiraj will be persecuted" if she returns to Albania. Still, she added, "She (Mrs. Demiraj) hasn't met her legal burden when it comes to asylum." Even despite the dangers for Rodina Demiraj, the Justice Department is pursuing deportation. The original assistant U.S. attorney who offered Edmond Demiraj a Green Card and, according to him, protection will not comment to CNN. She is Marina Garcia Marmojelo, now nominated by President Barack Obama to be a federal judge. The only official comment to CNN from Justice is this: "The department is not aware of any promises of physical protection ever made to Mr. Demiraj or his family. Notwithstanding this fact, we have been (in) active discussions with counsel for the Demiraj family for some time." Demiraj's lawyers are outraged. "This is just a shameful display of how the U.S. government will use people who they need to keep us safe and then cavalierly discard them when they are no longer of use to them," said Josh Rosenkranz, a New York City attorney whose firm is now representing the family. Edmond Demiraj says he will never let his wife and son return to Albania. "I don't know what I am going to do," he told CNN. "But I am not going to let them go."

In what appears to be a broader government purge of Turkey's police force, 350 police officers were removed from their positions in the capital of Ankara on Tuesday. Police commanders were also removed from their posts in at least nine other cities around the country, the semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. According to Turkish state media reports, most of the police officers affected were working in departments that battle terrorism, smuggling and organized crime. "The majority of the chiefs and police in question were appointed to the traffic unit," state broadcaster TRT reported on its website. The mass reassignment of police officers came amid reports of a fresh wave of police raids targeting suspects in a corruption case in the port city of Izmir. The Turkish government first began firing and reassigning scores of police officers last month, after police detained dozens of suspects closely linked to the government in an anti-corruption investigation. Amid corruption inquiry, Turkish prosecutor slams police Police reportedly found large amounts of cash and a money counting machine in the home of the son of the interior minister, as well as shoe boxes full of cash in the residence of the director of the state-owned HalkBank. On December 25, at least four Cabinet ministers implicated in the corruption scandal were forced to resign as part of a larger Cabinet reshuffle. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced the investigation. He has repeatedly said it is part of an "international conspiracy" aimed at toppling his government. Erdogan also criticized police who carried out the raids, accusing them of operating outside the chain of command. The government removed several prosecutors overseeing the investigation and briefly banned journalists from entering police stations. In a highly unusual news conference last month, one of those prosecutors accused the government of obstructing the investigation and allowing suspects to flee and tamper with evidence. Turkish police fire plastic bullets as anti-government protests rage Other observers are sounding the alarm about the independence of the judiciary in Turkey, which is both a member of the NATO military alliance and a nation that's negotiating to join the European Union. "The future of law enforcement, the separation of powers, the constitution is in danger," said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former member of parliament from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party. Kiniklioglu said the purge of the police force was part of the broader power struggle under way in Turkey between Erdogan and one of his former allies, a Turkish Muslim cleric who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. "The government is trying to remove police officers it thinks are close to the Fethullah Gulen group from positions where they could launch investigations into other corruption cases," Kiniklioglu told CNN. Gulen is the spiritual leader of an international empire of universities, businesses and media organizations. Until recently, he and his movement provided influential support to Erdogan during the prime minister's decade in power. Throughout this political alliance, some supporters of the reclusive cleric are believed to have assumed key positions in the Turkish police and judiciary. Last month's arrests turned simmering tensions between Erdogan and Gulen into an open verbal war between the two most charismatic leaders of moderate political Islam in Turkey. Erdogan and his deputies have openly denounced what they call a parallel state operating within the Turkish government bureaucracy. Gulen has responded in a fiery video sermon announcing, "Those who don't see the thief but go after those trying to catch the thief, who don't see the murder but try to defame others by accusing innocent people, then may God bring fire to their houses, ruin their homes, break their unity." The scandal has rattled Turkish markets. This week, the Turkish lira plunged to a record low against the dollar.
A federal judge ordered 10 municipal police officers arrested Saturday in connection with the slayings of 12 off-duty federal agents in southwestern Mexico, the attorney general's office said. The recent spate of violence was sparked by the arrest of high-ranking drug cartel member Arnoldo Rueda Medina. The federal officers' bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway in Michoacan state, where at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers have been killed since July 11 due to drug-related violence. Video from the scene showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, or narcomessages, left by the killers. They all stated the same thing: "So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here." The officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, whose home state is Michoacan, responded to the violence by dispatching 1,000 federal police officers to the area. The infusion, which more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan, angered Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel. He called it an occupation and said he had not been consulted. Authorities said Wednesday they were searching for the governor's half-brother, who they say is a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel. The cartel is blamed for most of the recent violence in the state. The governor's brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, was elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress. The governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday. The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia. La Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. Under Mexican law, the officers arrested Saturday will be held for 40 days while officials determine whether to formally charge them.
The United States hopes cool, careful language will keep the North Korean crisis from boiling over. The United States has been vocal in condemning North Korea for what it calls an act of aggression and provocation in the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors. But you won't hear American officials call this "an act of war." In fact, from President Obama on down the chain of command in this latest Korean crisis, the word "war" is missing in action. Obama set the tone, offering support and condolences to the South Koreans in March. Once an international investigation concluded last week that the patrol ship Cheonan was sunk by a North Korean torpedo, a White House statement called the ship sinking "an act of aggression ... one more instance of North Korea's unacceptable behavior and defiance of international law." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hit the same notes during her trip to China. "We are working hard to avoid an escalation, belligerence and provocation," Clinton said Monday. "This is a highly precarious situation that the North Koreans have caused in the region and it is one that every country that neighbors or is in proximity to North Korea understands must be contained." Washington is standing with South Korea's decision to halt trade agreements with North Korea. The United States also is emphasizing -- in both words and deeds -- its military ties to South Korea, including an announcement Monday at the Pentagon that the U.S. and South Korean militaries would conduct joint anti-submarine exercises. And the administration is holding its South Korean ally close. Clinton will be in Seoul on Wednesday, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates will meet his counterpart in coming weeks, while Obama will see South Korean President Lee Myung-bak at the Group of 20 conference of developed countries in Canada in June. But while White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday that U.S. support for the defense of South Korea is "unequivocal," he didn't mention war. "Specifically, we endorse President Lee's demand that North Korea immediately apologize and punish those responsible for the attack, and, most importantly, stop its belligerent and threatening behavior," Gibbs said in a prepared statement. North Korea has denied it was responsible for the March 26 sinking and has threatened to back out of a nonaggression pact between the two Koreas. Despite that pact and the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, the North and South technically remain at war. And North Korea has a huge standing army; it bristles with missiles and has tested nuclear weapons twice, in 2006 and 2009. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said last week the sinking of the ship was a violation of the armistice, but he chose the phrase "act of aggression." "As we've made clear, this was a clear and compelling violation of the existing armistice. It was without doubt a hostile act. It was provocative. It was unwarranted. I think our characterizations are broadly consistent," Crowley said. Over at the Pentagon, Gates and Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both sidestepped questions about whether what North Korea did constitutes an act of war. "Well, first of all, we certainly support the findings of the Korean -- the South Korean investigation," Gates said last week. "We obviously are in close consultation with the Koreans. The attack was against one of their ships. And we will -- naturally they would have the lead in determining the path forward. They've laid out some paths forward, and we will be consulting very closely with them as we move ahead." Mullen was equally evasive. "Certainly we're concerned about it. We've supported them. We've helped them in the investigation, and we agree with the conclusion. They're a great friend and great ally, and we'll continue to do that," Mullen said. Nicholas Szechenyi, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN, "If you respond to bombastic rhetoric with equally hot rhetoric, chances are this could escalate." "This is a very sensitive period," Szechenyi said in a telephone interview. "You have to be very careful in forming a response because North Korea is so unpredictable. You don't want this crisis to develop into all-out war." And Bruce Klingner, a northeast Asia analyst at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, said avoidance of the phrase "act of war" is both a question of how legal experts may evaluate what happened according to international rules -- and one of caution about fanning the flames. "It may be both definitional as well as concerns about inflammatory language," Klingner said. He said the U.S. was taking an appropriate tack in supporting South Korea. But he pointed out that the South Koreans themselves, outraged by the ship's sinking and loss of life, are treading carefully. "The Korean people are angry, but not angry enough to bring about an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula," Klingner said.
Hollywood should apologize to Iran for "insults and accusations against the Iranian nation," a top aide to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a visiting Hollywood delegation Sunday. "The Wrestler," starring Mickey Rourke was also attacked for being insulting towards Iran. Oscar-nominated "American Beauty" star Annette Bening was among the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to hear the remarks, Iran's state-run ISNA news agency said. "Representatives of Iran's film industry should only have an official meeting with representatives of the Academy and Hollywood if they apologize for the insults and accusations against the Iranian nation during the past 30 years," said Javad Shamghadri, Ahmadinejad's advisor on the arts, ISNA reported. He singled out the 1991 Sally Field thriller "Not Without My Daughter," about an American woman who marries an Iranian and then tries to flee Iran with their child, and the comic-book-inspired action flick "300" as "two clear examples of total lies." Do you think an apology is warranted? TheHollywood delegation, which ISNA said also includes AMPAS president Sid Ganis, is supposed to meet with Iranian filmmakers and hold a news conference on March 7. The Academy did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. But Shamghadri demanded to know how the meetings could produce results. "How can we sit and have a sincere meeting with American film makers while they they humiliate and insult the Iranian people and the great revolution of this nation?" he asked, ISNA reported. "The Iranian nation and its revolution has repeatedly and undeservedly been attacked by Hollywood movies," he said. "The film "The Wrestler" is the latest among them," he said of the film for which Mickey Rourke received an Oscar nomination this year. "We know that even right now there are other films being made with the aim of insulting and accusing the great nation of Iran and its rich culture." "The Wrestler" features a character known as The Ayatollah, played by Ernest Miller, who takes on Rourke's Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. -- CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.
A growing chorus of international agencies is calling for South Sudan's warring factions to cease hostilities. A day after East African leaders warned both the fledgling country and its rebel group to lay down their arms within four days, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon threw his weight behind that ultimatum from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). In a statement released Saturday, Ban said he lauded IGAD for "appointing a mediation team to work with the government of south Sudan and opposition in reaching a cease-fire, the release of the detainees and building toward a process of peaceful dialogue." "The United Nations stands with the people of South Sudan and will continue to do everything within its means to protect civilians at risk and provide necessary humanitarian assistance," the U.N. statement continued. "All violence, attacks and human rights abuses must end immediately. The Secretary-General reminds those responsible that they will be held accountable. He calls on the government and all concerned to ensure the rights and security of civilians are protected." It's unclear what the repercussions would be for either side if they refuse the demands. A communique issued Friday in Nairobi, Kenya, appears to throw IGAD's weight behind South Sudanese President Salva Kiir, whose government has said that it would come to the negotiating table without preconditions. Kiir has accused rival politician Riek Machar, his former vice president, of trying to stage a coup-- a claim Machar has denied. Kiir's Vice President, James Wani Igga, says Machar will make it difficult for both sides to meet IGAD's truce deadline. "Dr. Riek has put obstacles to this genuine call by issuing preconditions: namely that the cease-fire or peace cannot be reached unless a negotiation is conducted, and added a number of obstacles," the South Sudanese Vice President said Saturday. Kiir and Machar are longtime rivals from two different tribal clans. Kiir is from the Dinka tribe, Machar from the Neur. Fighting broke out between Kiir's government and supporters of Machar on December 15 in the capital city of Juba. It quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings lent credence by mass graves. Worried about the safety of medical staff and facilities, Doctors Without Borders is also asking both sides to alleviate "the volatile and rapidly evolving security situation." The international aid group says it has provided medical care to approximately 40,000 people who have fled to two U.N. bases in Juba since the latest wave of violence began. The U.N. says more than 63,000 total civilians are now crowded onto its compounds across South Sudan. Even though a curfew is in place in Juba, and though the capital has been relatively safe and stable compared to other parts of South Sudan for the past week or so, scared and beleaguered civilians have refused to leave the U.N. compounds. On Friday, 72 peacekeepers arrived in Juba, according to the United Nations. It was the first group of an additional 5,500 peacekeepers approved by U.N. Security Council. The additional personnel will increase the total peacekeeping force in South Sudan to 12,500 soldiers and 1,323 police officers. CNN's Arwa Damon and journalist Mading Ngor reported from Juba, South Sudan, and CNN's Mark Morgenstein wrote this story in Atlanta.
The key to understanding the tragedy that was Jonestown lies in the oratory skills of the Peoples Temple founder, Jim Jones. "He was very charismatic," Leslie Wagner-Wilson, a Jonestown survivor, says of the Rev. Jim Jones. With the cadence and fervor of a Baptist preacher, the charm and folksiness of a country storyteller and the zeal and fury of a maniacal dictator, Jones exhorted his followers to a fever pitch, audiotapes recovered from Jonestown reveal. As he spoke, they applauded, shouted, cheered. One follower who survived the "revolutionary suicide" at Jonestown on November 18, 1978, said that Jones was the most dynamic speaker he had ever heard. Like all powerful speakers, Jones' greatest asset was his ability to determine what listeners wanted to hear and give it to them in simple language that appealed to them on an almost instinctual level. "He was very charismatic, very charismatic," said Leslie Wilson, who survived that fateful day in Jonestown by walking away from the settlement before the cyanide that killed more than 900 Peoples Temple members was distributed. She was one of 33 people who began the day in Jonestown and lived to tell the tale. "He could quote scripture and turn around and preach socialism," she said. "He appealed to anyone on any level at any time."  Hear Jones declare "I am God" » Many of his followers were elderly African-Americans drawn to his cause by his soulful delivery and Pentecostal preaching style, including at times speaking in tongues. That hair-raising fervor was perhaps only overshadowed by what he said. "When I say, I am God, then I feel [faith] well up within my soul. And I see it well up in you, and I see the sick healed, and the blind see, and the dead raised. ... You wanna know how I feel, I never feel so good as when I say I am God," he shouted in a full-throated roar in a 1972 sermon. Jones further enraptured crowds with faith healings -- laying hands on disabled or sick people who would miraculously be cured of any ailments. Though insiders later revealed that these healings were staged, Jones' mastery of word and presentation left few in attendance with any doubts about his abilities. He also indoctrinated many young, idealistic liberal white people in progressive 1970s California with the themes of socialism, equality and political activism. And he justified his brand of socialism with the Bible for those recruited from more conservative religious factions, who might have found such left-wing ideas tough to swallow. "The only ethic by which we can lift mankind today is some form of socialism," he said in another 1972 sermon. "There's a smattering of it in the, in the New Testament. It's very evidently clear on the day of Pentecost that they that believed were together and had all things common." Socialism, he said, is "older than the Bible by far." But by the time Jones and many of his followers completed a lengthy relocation from California to Jonestown in Guyana in 1977, he had begun to change as a speaker. His trademark passionate delivery gave way to blind fury and incredible rage.  Listen to the rage of Jim Jones » "I been tired for 25 years," the 47-year-old Jones preached in 1978, his voice rising steadily in pitched anger. "I'm tired of looking at people's faces that don't give a f--- for 25 years, I watch and they don't give a g------. You can lay it out in front of them, and they will not listen. They will not read. They will not do anything, and that's why I have to suffer every day and all night and all through the hours, because I will have nobody but a few that will carry the burden with me. Because you hide yourself away in ignorance." His rages created a fear that cemented the hold he had on his followers. He also used a "divide and conquer" method among his followers. "What Jones did was try to break all ties that were not to him," said former believer Vernon Gosney. "Transfer all that loyalty, all that bonding to him. And so families were broken apart. Relationships were divided." Such divisions caused family members to spy and report on one another, or friends to turn in friends for various transgressions. Jones furthered the poisonous atmosphere among his followers by encouraging physical fighting to either solve problems or administer punishment. Audiotapes of such sessions reveal Jones laughing, apparently entertained. Jones' mastery of the spoken word also enabled his many sexual exploits with both female and male followers. Jones deftly justified his actions to his followers by saying that what he did to them was actually for their own benefit, or the benefit of making the church a stronger, tighter-knit organization. He preached that many of his male followers were in denial about their homosexuality, conditioning those followers to accept him if he approached with a sexual advance. And he defused any accusations of sexual perversion on his part by claiming that he gained no personal pleasure from his acts, which he called a "great sacrifice." "And if the leader is attracted to you, then somehow that cultivates," Jones said during a temple meeting in 1978. "Well, you ought to know I'm attracted to you, I'm ready to die for every one of you, so that means I'm attracted to you. You follow what I'm saying? I'm attracted to all of you. How much more attraction can you have than to be ready to have your eyes plucked out?" By the end at Jonestown, Jones was more rock star than preacher. His sermons and remarks at meetings were littered with obscenities. He regularly had sex with his followers and he abused drugs. By the last month of Jonestown's existence, Jones was so intoxicated at times that he had great difficulty even reading the news aloud to his followers. As the end drew near, Jones' tone as a speaker took darker turns. He constantly fed his followers in Guyana a steady diet of fatalism. "I said, life is a f------ disease," he said. "It's worse than cancer. It's a disease. And there's only one cure for the sonofabitchin' disease. That's death. And socialists can only take one form of death. What is it? Fight a goddamn war, or revolutionary suicide. If you don't believe life's a disease, then you're dumb. Very dumb." Spurred on by their leader's talk, Peoples Temple members were ready to follow Jones even into death. At his request, they even wrote personal notes to him expressing their willingness to die for their cause.  Some followers willing to die » This was the ultimate test of loyalty, and the absolute testimony to the power of his words. As history shows, Jim Jones the orator was chillingly effective.

A former engineer for Rockwell International and Boeing was convicted Thursday of economic espionage and acting as an agent of China, authorities said. A Delta IV rocket launches on March 10, 2003 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Dongfan "Greg" Chung, 73, was accused of stealing restricted technology and Boeing trade secrets, including information related to the space shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket. U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney convicted him on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage; six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country; one count of acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China; and one count of making false statements to the FBI, according to a statement from federal prosecutors. Carney presided over Chung's three-week bench trial last month. In a bench trial, there is no jury and the judge decides whether to convict a defendant after hearing testimony. Chung was free on bond after his arrest by FBI agents and NASA investigators in February 2008. He was taken into custody after Carney's ruling was read. Chung, a native of China who is a naturalized United States citizen, was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until Boeing acquired its defense and space unit in 1996, and by Boeing thereafter. He retired from Boeing in 2002, but returned as a contractor, a position he held until September 2006, prosecutors said. Chung held a "secret" security clearance, authorities said. "For years, Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing relating to the space shuttle and the Delta IV rocket -- all for the benefit of the government of China," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security, in the prosecutors' statement. "Today's verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America's economic and national security to assist foreign governments." The case against Chung resulted from an investigation into another engineer who obtained information for China. That engineer, Chi Mak, and several of his relatives were convicted of providing defense articles to the PRC, authorities said. Mak was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison last year. According to evidence presented at trial, individuals in the Chinese aviation industry began sending tasks to Chung via letter as early as 1979, federal prosecutors said. Over the years, the letters directed Chung to collect data related to the space shuttle and various military and civilian aircraft. In his letters back to China, Chung referenced materials he had already sent, including 24 manuals relating to the B-1 bomber, which Rockwell had forbidden for distribution outside the company and federal agencies. In addition, between 1985 and 2003, Chung traveled to China several times and met with government officials. His contacts in China discussed these trips in letters and recommended methods of passing information, authorities said. In a 2006 search of Chung's home, FBI and NASA agents found more than 250,000 pages of documents from Boeing, Rockwell and other defense contractors in the house and in its crawl space, prosecutors said. They included "scores of binders containing decades' worth of stress analysis reports, test results and design information for the space shuttle." Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, authorities said. The charge of acting as an agent for a foreign government carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage and making false statements to federal investigators each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Chung is set for sentencing November 9.
Twenty Greenpeace activists entered a nuclear reactor compound in eastern Spain early Tuesday and several of them climbed a refrigeration tower to protest the use of nuclear power, a Spanish official and Greenpeace spokeswomen said. The security breach occurred at the Cofrentes nuclear power plant at the town of Cofrentes in eastern Valencia province, where the activists painted the word "peligro," which means "danger," high up on the tower. A spokeswoman for the Spanish government's main office in the Valencia region said the "vital" parts of the nuclear plant were not affected, were tightly secured and were operating normally. A plant security guard was "slightly injured" by the activists as they entered. The guard was treated at the plant medical facility, the government spokeswoman said. Greenpeace activists maintained a running blog on the environmental organization's website about the events, writing that the Greenpeace team entered the plant around 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) and that six of them scaled the 125 meter, or 400 foot, tall refrigeration tower. The government spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified, said there might have been as many as 14 Greenpeace activists up on the tower. Others on the ground were quickly identified by security personnel and sent to a local courthouse. Cofrentes, one of eight nuclear reactors in Spain, started operations in 1984. But its current 10-year operating license expires next March 20, Spain's nuclear regulatory body, the Nuclear Security Council, said on its website. Greenpeace has long been known for its stance against the use of nuclear power. Government officials did not immediately comment on how the activists managed to breach security at the Cofrentes plant. Due to previous Islamic terrorist attacks in Madrid and elsewhere in Europe, the Spanish government has repeatedly said it has a fine tuned security plan for its nuclear plants and other installations, such as dams, that are considered a priority to the nation's security. Spain in 2007 generated only about 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear power; the rest coming from coal, renewable wind, solar and other sources.
Authorities arrested eight people Saturday -- including five journalists of Britain's bestselling Sun newspaper -- as part of an inquiry into alleged illegal payments to police and officials. The other three are a police officer, an employee of the Ministry of Defence and a member of the armed forces, the Metropolitan Police said. A search was carried out at News International's offices in east London, the police said, as well as the homes of those arrested. News International, which owns the Sun, is a U.K. subsidiary of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Following the arrests, Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp, issued a personal assurance to one of his executives to continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Mockridge also said he was "very saddened" by the arrests of deputy editor Geoff Webster, picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker, and John Sturgis, who is a news editor. The five journalists were arrested at their homes, police said. "I understand the pressure many of you are under and have the greatest admiration for everyone's continued professionalism," Mockridge wrote. "The Sun has a proud history of delivering ground-breaking journalism. You should know that I have had a personal assurance today from Rupert Murdoch about his total commitment to continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper. "Today we are facing our greatest challenge," Mockridge said. The Sun's editor, Dominic Mohan, said in a statement: "I'm as shocked as anyone by today's arrests but am determined to lead The Sun through these difficult times. "I have a brilliant staff and we have a duty to serve our readers and will continue to do that. Our focus is on putting out Monday's newspaper." Mohan has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million. The arrests are part of Operation Elveden, an investigation running in parallel with a police inquiry into alleged phone hacking by the media, the police statement said. Late Saturday, all eight people were released after posting bail, police said. News Corp.'s Management and Standards Committee said it had provided the information to the Elveden investigation which led to Saturday's operation. Elveden has been widened out to include alleged corruption involving public officials, as well as the police. The five journalists, with ages between 45 and 68, were arrested at their residences in London, Kent and Essex on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both offenses, police said. News Corp. said in a statement that it "remains committed to ensuring that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past will not be repeated." The other three suspects were arrested on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both these offenses. A 39-year-old officer with Surrey Police is being questioned at a London police station, the Met Police said. The Ministry of Defence employee, a 39-year-old woman, is being questioned at a police station in Wiltshire, as is the member of the armed forces, a 36-year-old man. The police said the operation "relates to suspected payments to police officers and public officials and is not about seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained legitimately." The Ministry of Defence said it was a matter for the Metropolitan Police and that it could not comment on an ongoing police investigation. The latest arrests come two weeks after four current and former Sun employees and a London police officer were arrested in connection with Operation Elveden. News Corp. established its Management and Standards Committee in the wake of the summer 2011 scandal over alleged hacking of voicemail, which led to the closure of the News of the World Sunday tabloid. The revelation that a murdered 13-year-old girl's phone was hacked by journalists in search of stories -- and that many other crime and terror victims, politicians and celebrities had also been targeted -- prompted widespread outrage in Britain. News Group Newspapers, part of News International, paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds this week to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including a former Tony Blair spokesman, Alastair Campbell. The latest settlements meant News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. British Prime Minister David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into press ethics and practices in response to the scandal. Mohan defended his newspaper in testimony before the Leveson Inquiry earlier this month. "The Sun is a private enterprise that performs a public duty with a public interest: to inform a mass readership so that British democracy can function properly," he said in a written witness statement. "The Sun is occasionally boisterous and often cheeky but it is always a loyal companion to our readers, male and female. It relates to them in a more passionate way than any other title and in doing so it has become Britain's best-selling newspaper." Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal. There have been 17 arrests in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking inquiry, and 21 in connection with Operation Elveden. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. A third police inquiry is investigating alleged email hacking. No one has been charged.

Rafael Nadal's status as the world's top tennis player may have dimmed slightly with two recent final defeats, but the Spaniard showed again on Sunday that he is the man to beat on clay. The 24-year-old extended his record of most successive titles in an ATP Tour event with his seventh success in Monte Carlo, boosting his leading tally of Masters Series crowns to 19. Nadal beat fourth-seeded compatriot David Ferrer 6-4 7-5 in the final as he shook off successive losses on hard-court surfaces to the pretender to his throne, Novak Djokovic, to claim his 44th career title and the $630,000 first prize. He has won 30 of those on clay, putting him equal third in the post-1968 Open Era list alongside compatriot Manuel Orantes and Bjorn Borg. "Rafa is incredible on clay. I mean, he's everywhere at the same time. He's the best player on clay in history," Ferrer told the tournament's official web site. Djokovic, unbeaten in 2011, missed this tournament due to a knee injury but the Serbian is expected to line up alongside Nadal at the Madrid Masters at the start of next month. Nadal won that event last year as he went through the clay season unbeaten, culminating in his fifth French Open triumph. That run saw him beat Ferrer in the final of the Rome Masters, and he again denied the 29-year-old a 1,000-point haul in Monte Carlo on Sunday as he avenged his defeat at the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. Ferrer dropped serve as early as the third game, but the world No. 6 broke back immediately as both players made uncharacteristic errors that would be symptomatic of a match also featuring moments of brilliance. Nadal broke again in the fifth game and won the opening set in 70 minutes. He won against serve in the third game of the second set before Ferrer fought back to lead 5-4, but Nadal broke him again to go 6-5 up and sealed victory when his opponent netted on the second match-point. Nadal's only defeat in Monte Carlo came at his first appearance in 2003. Is Sharapova back as a real contender? Meanwhile, Russia ended Italy's Fed Cup reign by reaching the final of the women's teams event with a comprehensive 5-0 victory on Sunday. The home team led 2-0 after the opening day in Moscow, and world No. 3 Vera Zvonareva put her country into the title match for the first time since her last appearance in the tournament in 2008 by beating Roberta Vinci 6-4 6-2. With the tie over, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova stepped in for Saturday's singles winner Svetlana Kuznetsova to hand Sara Errani her second defeat as the Russian triumphed 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-4). Pavlyuchenkova and Ekaterina Makarova then sealed the whitewash, beating Alberta Brianti and Maria-Elena Camerin 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in the doubles. Italy had won the title the past two years, but went into this match without top-ranked players Francesca Schiavone and Flavia Pennetta. Four-time champions Russia will play the Czech Republic in the final after the other semifinal in Belgium went to the deciding doubles rubber after both teams won a singles tie on Sunday. Czech No. 1 Petra Kvitova gave her country a 2-1 lead in Charleroi with a 7-5 4-6 2-6 victory over Yanina Wickmayer, Belgium's top-ranked player in the absence of injured world No. 2 Kim Clijsters. But 106th-ranked Kirsten Flipkens leveled the score again by beating Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova 6-2 6-3. Zahlavova-Strycova then paired up with Iveta Benesova to beat Flipkens and Wickmayer 6-4 6-4 to seal a 3-2 win. Czechoslovakia won the title five times but not since separating into two nations following the Velvet Revolution in 1989.
She's a drummer, a producer, a vocalist and a mom. Terri Lyne Carrington knows a lot about transformation. In fact, "Transformation" is the title of the first track on Carrington's Grammy-nominated CD, "The Mosaic Project." The vocals on the track "Transformation" are performed by Nona Hendryx, perhaps best known from her days as part of Labelle, the singing group from the '70s that helped launch the career of the iconic singer Patti LaBelle. Carrington explained the song was originally written and recorded by Hendryx in the 1980s. "I remember growing up listening to it and it was always a song I felt connected to on some level," Carrington said. In later years the two performed together and Carrington said when she started to put "The Mosaic Project" together, she thought, "Why don't we do a jazz version of 'Transformation'?" The song varies quite a bit from the original and Carrington said she wasn't sure Hendryx would even like her arrangement. She said when she played it for Hendryx, "First she had to really get used to it and then she ended up really loving it and she sang it great as well." "The Mosaic Project" is Carrington's fifth album. A child prodigy, she has toured with some of the greatest names in jazz over the past two decades, including luminaries such as Herbie Hancock, Dizzy Gillespie, Al Jarreau, Joe Sample and Stan Getz. In fact, Carrington, now 46, was only 11 years old when she performed with drummer Buddy Rich on a television show, impressing him with her clean technique and solid coordination. She said "The Mosaic Project" makes her feel, "a little bit like a trailblazer," because when she was a kid starting out there weren't any other female drummers that she knew of and only a few female instrumentalists. "It's good to see a lot of younger women not having any preconceived notions about what they can do," Carrington said. "It seems normal for a lot of them to play male-dominated instruments and I think that's a beautiful thing. Everything about this recording is about making a larger picture out of many various elements." To that end, she gathered most of her closest friends (who happen to be great musicians and great singers) and had them help out with the project. Carrington said she envisioned the project for awhile, then "...it came together. The stars aligned and everybody was on board, so I was very fortunate." Included in that list of "friends" are some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades, including, besides Hendryx: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and more. The 14-song set weaves a story of transformation, using everything from jazz to hip hop to the spoken word. Civil rights and women's rights activist Angela Davis introduces a track called "Echo," which Carrington said brings together three women who have been very influential in her development as a black woman and "just figuring out who I am." Those three are: Bernice Johnson Reagon of the group "Sweet Honey In The Rock," who originally wrote the song, Reeves, who performs the vocals, and Davis. Carrington said she's most proud of that song. Listeners might be surprised to learn "The Mosaic Project" also includes a cover of the Beatles classic "Michelle." Carrington makes no secret of her affinity for the Beatles' music. On her last CD, "More to Say," she covered "Let it Be." Carrington said she wrote the arrangement of "Michelle" a few years back and played it live, but this seemed like the right time to record it. "I'm already thinking about the next Beatles song" she said with a chuckle. Drumsticks in hand, Carrington is helping trumpet the joys of jazz to new generations and new audiences and she's optimistic about its future. "It's a high art form," she said. "I don't think it's going anywhere." She said people often ask her if jazz is dead. "I still put on the classic jazz and it's still very much alive," she said. "What's happening is it morphs and changes. But the library that's being created under the umbrella of jazz is incredible and it's just more and more music that people will have access to."
Formula One rookie Pastor Maldonado is confident he will have a successful debut season driving for Williams. "The feeling in the team and with my engineers is good," the Venezuelan told the official F1 website on Friday. "I know it will be a really great season with them. If everything goes well, I don't see why we can't score points." The 26-year-old GP2 champion will line up on a F1 grid for the first time at the opening grand prix of the season in Melbourne on March 27. And despite finishing down in 12th out of the 14 drivers participating in pre-season testing in Barcelona on Friday, Maldonado insists he is prepared for the challenges ahead. "I am feeling better and better within the team. We will see what we can do at the first race but I feel ready," he said Maldonado will make also make history this season, as he becomes the first Venezuelan to take part in the F1 championship. "I am very happy for my country as they are pushing very hard for me and that is something special," he said. "It is going to be an exciting moment for me. I have been racing for many years and I have waited many years to be in Formula One." Maldonado will line up alongside veteran Brazilian racer Rubens Barrichello at British-based F1 outfit Williams, who finished sixth in the drivers' championship last year. Barrichello was the fifth fastest driver in Friday's penultimate testing session, while seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher clocked one minute 21.268 seconds to set the quickest time for Mercedes. Another former champion, Fernando Alonso, was second quickest for Ferrari, with Schumacher's teammate Nico Rosberg completing the top three times. Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel was eighth fastest in his Red Bull, while 2009 winner Jenson Button had a frustrating day and could only manage the 13th best time. CNN-sponsored Team Lotus were not involved in the session but they did confirm the appointments of Luiz Razia as third driver and Davide Valsecchi and Ricardo Teixeira as test drivers. Alongside their commitments in the GP2 series, Razia and Valsecchi will take part in Friday practice sessions this season. Meanwhile, Lotus Renault driver Robert Kubica is set to undergo a further operation on his elbow, the hospital treating him said on Friday. Since crashing at a rally in February, the Pole has already gone under the knife three times. German driver Nick Heidfeld will replace Kubica over the upcoming season.
Elizabeth Taylor went to the Hollywood Bowl to hear Andrea Bocelli in concert, the first night out in months for the big-screen legend. Elizabeth Taylor went to see Andrea Bocelli at the Hollywood Bowl, a rare outing for the film legend. Taylor, bound to a wheelchair by scoliosis, said her mind and soul "were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being." The 77-year-old actress posted online messages through the Twitter social network after the Italian tenor's concert Monday night. "I went to see Andrea Bocelli last night. The first time I've been out in months. The Hollywood Bowl allowed me to use my wheelchair," Taylor's first tweet said. "My mind, my soul were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being. God has kissed this man and I thank God for it," she wrote in a second message. Taylor opened her Twitter account this year as "DameElizabeth" at the suggestion of her close friend, model-actress-author-businesswoman Kathy Ireland, her publicist Dick Guttman said. Taylor is "very adventurous" and "exceedingly active" despite health problems that sent her to a hospital for a week last month, Guttman said. She is working on a new perfume to follow up on her popular White Diamonds, he said.
Tuesday's Supreme Court decision in Berghuis v. Thompkins -- holding that, after being informed of their rights, suspects must explicitly tell police that they want to stay silent to invoke their Miranda protections -- indeed turns Miranda "upside down," as one dissenting justice put it. Its potential consequences are as predictable as night following day: Police will interrogate criminal suspects who do not explicitly invoke their rights -- often, those will be suspects who are unsophisticated, poorly educated or mentally ill -- for hours on end. This will lead, just as inevitably, to more coerced -- and therefore unreliable -- confessions. And this will result in wrongful incarceration and diminish our collective security. This is the very phenomenon that Miranda aimed to eliminate. To be sure, the ruling is a setback for the protections designed to ensure an effective criminal justice system (Miranda requires police officers to inform suspects of the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney). But there is one silver lining in Berghuis' cloud: The ruling demonstrates that the Supreme Court is not shy about curtailing Miranda protections, even without prodding from Congress. Hence the ruling should derail Congress' recent calls to enact an unnecessary, likely overbroad and possibly unconstitutional statute further restricting Miranda's requirements. The issue arose when Attorney General Eric Holder, among others, called on lawmakers to step in and limit Miranda by expanding the "public safety exception." That exception allows law enforcement officials to interrogate suspected terrorists for a limited time before advising them of their Miranda rights -- if the officers are "reasonably prompted by a concern for public safety." But this call for codifying has always been somewhat baffling, as it is so clearly not needed. Expanding of the public safety exception legislatively may score political points for lawmakers or government officials bent on appearing tough on terrorism, but such action would not improve the efficacy of our counterterrorism policy. In fact, the public safety exception in its current form has proved extremely effective in allowing law enforcement the necessary flexibility in questioning terror suspects. After two recent attempted terror attacks, both the "underwear bomber" suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and "Times Square bomber" suspect Faisal Shahzad were questioned under the public safety exception. They both reportedly provided interrogators with valuable intelligence during that time and continued to do so even after being advised of their rights. As the attorney general himself observed, "the giving of Miranda warnings has not stopped these terror suspects from talking to us. They have continued to talk even though we have given them a Miranda warning." Legislation on the public safety exception is also risky. While courts consider the issues that come to them on a case-by-case basis, deciding what the law requires in the context of a particular set of circumstances, Congress must act in the abstract, imagining a variety of situations that might occur and attempting to draft a law able to address each of them. Thus any congressional attempt to define the scope of the public safety exception, especially in a political environment dominated by a sense that the next terrorist attempt might occur at any moment, is likely to overreach. Moreover, we know from the 2000 case Dickerson v. United States, which struck down a law aimed at limiting the scope of Miranda, that the Supreme Court will draw the line on curtailing Miranda's protections. Thus any statute passed now to expand or codify the exception runs the risk of judicial invalidation. The result would be that any convictions secured through confessions elicited under the invalidated law would be reversed. Today's decision, however, removes any doubt about whether Congress should take action. It should not. Without Congress ever introducing a bill or taking a single vote, the Supreme Court just expanded significantly law enforcement officials' ability to interrogate at length all criminal suspects, terrorists or otherwise, even after they have been properly Mirandized. Until suspected terrorists unambiguously assert their desire to remain silent, government officials may continue to interrogate them for hours or even days, using any statement they make against them in subsequent prosecution. Moreover, this decision sends a strong signal: While it might look with hostility on congressional attempts to rein in the scope of the Miranda rule, the Supreme Court itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that Miranda affords criminal defendants. And it is willing to reach relatively far to do so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Emily Berman.
Nickelodeon star Miranda Cosgrove suffered a broken ankle when her tour bus wrecked on an Illinois highway Thursday morning, her representative said. Five passengers were on the bus when it crashed on Interstate 70, just outside of Vandalia, Illinois, the rep said in a statement to CNN. "At this time, we are told everyone will be fine," the rep said. "Because of this, her tour is postponed until further notice." Cosgrove, 18, has been touring to promote her music, but she is well known for her acting. She's the star of Nickelodeon's hit TV show "iCarly." CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.
Authorities are offering rewards totaling up to $125,000 for information about a fatal weekend shooting of a postal worker in Maryland. Tyson Jerome Barnette, 26, was on duty when he was killed, according to the Prince George's County Police Department. Shortly before 7:30 p.m. ET Saturday, officers were called the scene, where Barnette was pronounced dead from apparent gunshot wounds. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the letter carrier and his family during this very difficult time. We are all deeply saddened," said Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers. "The nation's letter carriers deliver the mail in every community throughout the country. This tragic incident highlights the need in all operational decisions about how and when mail is delivered to give priority consideration to the safety of these dedicated public servants," he added. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is offering a reward of up to $100,000, while police are offering one of up to $25,000 for information leading to an arrest and indictment in the case. Both agencies are investigating the shooting. It was not immediately clear what motivated the killing, which happened while Barnette was driving someone else's mail route, said Postal Inspector Frank Schissler. He said there were no witnesses.
After about 30 hours of deliberation, a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago. Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing. Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square, Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced. Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29. Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, "Yes." Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal. "We don't believe justice was done," Weinberg said. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long "pattern of violence" involving firearms.  Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict » "This was not an isolated incident," Fidler said, noting Spector's two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s. "The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that." Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna. Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003. A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating 15 days, jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction. In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector "a very dangerous man" who "has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth." Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out. Do pointed out, however, to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done, the prosecutor said. A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict. "This entire jury took this so seriously," she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that "it's tough to be in a jury," because another person's life is in the jury's hands. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie "Barbarian Queen" and appeared in many other films, including "DeathStalker," "Blind Date," "Scarface," "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" and the spoof "Amazon Women on the Moon." She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, "I think I killed somebody." Spector's retrial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector. Spector's professional trademark was the "Wall of Sound," the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict? The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called "little symphonies for the kids" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' "Be My Baby" and the Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'." Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, "Let It Be," and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year. Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.
The  Justice Department, as promised, moved Tuesday to block a court ruling  preventing use of government funds for embryonic stem cell  research. The lower-court decision that bars the use of publicly funded stem-cell work had stunned the Obama administration, which had vowed to appeal. "The government is  seeking a stay of the court's injunction to prevent the irreparable human and  financial harm that could occur if these life-saving research projects are forced  to abruptly shut down," said Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy  Schmaler. "The court's order causes  irrevocable harm to the millions of extremely sick or injured people who stand  to benefit from continuing research as well as to the taxpayers who have spent  hundreds of millions of dollars on this research," a Justice Department  statement said. The Justice lawyers  filed the notice of appeal and the proposed stay with U.S. District Court  Judge Royce Lamberth, who had granted the injunction sought by plaintiffs opposed  to research in which embryos had been destroyed. "We've said from day one that embryonic  stem cell research is a top priority for this administration, and we're going to  do everything possible to prevent the potentially catastrophic  consequences of this injunction," said White House spokesman Reid Cherlin. The government said if  Lamberth has not granted the stay by September 7, the government would "present  their stay request to the Court of Appeals the following day". In that event, a  three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, would likely rule quickly  on the request for a stay, while it schedules briefs and arguments on the legal  merits of the case which may take months. Government lawyers filed  the appeal on behalf of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the National Institutes  of Health, and its director, Francis Collins. Collins said NIH has  invested over $546 million in taxpayers' money in human embryonic stem cell  research since 2001. In a 12-page statement attached to the appeal, Collins  said the court order prevents NIH from providing $54 million in funds to 24  human embryonic research projects currently under way that were expecting to  receive funds within the next month. He said another 199 grants would be  discontinued for projects which were to be awarded funding after the September  30 deadline ordered by the court. Judge Lamberth had ruled  that all embryonic stem-cell research involves destroying embryos. He said a  provision of federal spending bills "unambiguously prohibits the use of federal  funds for all research in which a human embryo is  destroyed". The legal arguments with  which Lamberth sided were brought by researchers opposed to use of embryonic  stem cells. Plaintiffs included a group that seeks adoptive parents for human  embryos created through in vitro fertilization, the non-profit Christian  Medical Association and others. CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry contributed to this report.
Someone phoned in a bomb threat to the Moscow Aviation Institute on Tuesday, prompting the evacuation of 7,000 students from all 12 buildings at the institute, officials said. The threat was specific to one building, but all 12 buildings at the institute were evacuated as a precaution, Moscow police said. Police have been combing through the buildings with sniffer dogs. Security in Russia has been a global concern recently as the Sochi Winter Olympics take place about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) south of Moscow.
Former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik was indicted on charges of making false statements to White House officials vetting him for the secretary's seat at the Department of Homeland Security in 2004, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Bernard Kerik served as New York City police commissioner from 1998 to 2002. Kerik, who served as commissioner from 1998 to 2002, allegedly gave false and misleading answers to Bush administration officials about his relationship with contractors who renovated his Riverdale apartment, according to the indictment handed up by a Washington grand jury. Prosecutors allege Kerik received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his home from contractors seeking to do business with the city of New York. In December, Kerik pleaded not guilty to another indictment in New York levying similar charges against him, but those charges were dismissed because the incident allegedly happened in Washington, officials said. Kerik's attorney, Barry Berke, called the Washington indictment "the latest example of the Department of Justice's overzealous pursuit of high-profile public figures." He said his client is confident he will be vindicated. Kerik , 53, is a longtime friend and former protege of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Then-President George W. Bush nominated him for secretary of Homeland Security after winning re-election in 2004, but Kerik withdrew his name amid allegations that he employed a nanny who had questionable immigration status.

Australia has raised its terror alert level to "high" for the first time since the national alert system was introduced in 2003. According to the four-level system, a reading of "high" means a terrorist attack "is likely," however the country's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said no specific threat had been made. "This does not mean a terror attack is imminent, we have no specific intelligence of particular plots. What we do have is intelligence that there are people with the intent and capability to mount attacks," Abbott said at a press conference in Canberra on Friday. What does "high" mean? Australia introduced its alert system in 2003, with four levels of risk: low, medium, high and extreme. It's been at "medium" since the system began, and is defined as meaning a "terrorist attack could occur." The elevation to "high" would not make much difference to daily life for most people, the prime minister said. "What people would probably notice though is more security at airports, more security at ports, more security at military bases, more security at government buildings and more security at large public events," he said. Why now? The decision to raise the level was foreshadowed by the departing director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) earlier this week. David Irvine said the threat level had been building in Australia over the last year, due to the increasing influence of jihadists fighting for Islamic extremists ISIS in the Middle East who had recruited Australians to fight. "They are of concern because, if they come home, they come home with training and with potentially increased intent," he told the ABC. Officials believe there are at least 60 Australians fighting with terror group ISIS, and as many as 100 "facilitators" still in the country. A number of arrest warrants have been issued for suspected terrorists fighting abroad, and police have swooped on a number of suspects in Australia, most recently arresting two men in Brisbane for allegedly recruiting and funding fighters sent to Syria. Alert levels elsewhere Australia's higher alert level follows an increase in the United Kingdom, which raised its level from "substantial" to "severe" in late August. Again, authorities said there was no intelligence to suggest an attack was imminent. However, hundreds of British citizens are believed to have joined jihadists abroad. Notably, a hooded man with a British accent appeared to be the executioner of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff on videos released by ISIS. The U.S. replaced its color-coded warning system with the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) in 2011. NTAS alerts are only issued if there's "credible information about a threat." And, alerts are classified as either "elevated" or "imminent." France abandoned its color-coded alerts earlier this year, and instead now relies on a two-level "Vigipirate" system. When more vigilance is needed, the triangle logo is displayed in public places. If there's specific intelligence of an attack, the logo carries the words "alerte attentat" or "attack alert."

Footage of the beating of a New Jersey man, who was forced to strip naked for a belt-whipping over an apparent $20 debt, has garnered the attention of Newark city officials after the online video went viral. "Take everything off right now. You're moving too slow," a man yelled in shaky cell phone video, which shows him whipping the naked victim as others crowd around. Moments before the August assault, a man handed the assailant his belt as the cameraman appears to spray the victim, now 21, with a clear liquid. "Your father owe me money. Take everything off, jeans, everything," the male voice said. The video then shows the man being whipped 49 times as others laugh in what appears to be a gang-related attack, according to Newark Police Director Samuel A. DeMaio. Three men were charged for aggravated assault, conspiracy, possession of a weapon, and robbery after they allegedly stole $20 from the victim. A 25-year-old woman who was present during the attack has also been arrested on drug charges, which include alleged "possession of 20 bricks of heroin." On Wednesday, Newark Mayor Cory Booker called the incident "shocking," "disturbing" and "a blow to the conscious of our community." He said it points to a "subculture of violence we have to address." "This is not who we are," said Booker, who then admonished those who may have witnessed the attack, but failed to report it. "We do not tolerate this level of cruelty." The victim's father apparently owed the assailant $20, according to police and multiple voices heard on the video. Newark Councilman Ronald Rice called the video "a documentation of our dysfunction."

who was among 12 defendants, five like him still on the run, who were the subject of an Algerian court hearing Monday related to their terrorist involvement -- said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. But regional analysts believe the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned so quickly, and Sallal said the hostage scheme had been hatched over months. Algerian minister says gas plant will restart, foreign workers will return The targeted gas facility is run by Algeria's state oil company, in cooperation with foreign firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP. Some 790 people worked there, including 134 foreign workers, Algeria's prime minister said. Read more: Algerian forces seek 'peaceful' settlement of dramatic, deadly hostage crisis British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday the effort to evacuate workers is complete and that U.K. officials are now focused on bringing the bodies of slain British hostages back home. Cameron praised Algerian forces for their work in ending the crisis, despite concerns from some nations earlier that the Algerians had unnecessarily put hostages at greater risk. "This would have been a most-demanding task for security forces anywhere in the world, and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the Algerians in undertaking it," the British leader said. "The responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the terrorists." Such Islamist militant activity is not new to Africa, including recent violence in Mali and Somalia. Algeria's status as Africa's largest natural gas producer and a major supplier of the product to Europe heightens its importance to those who want to invest there. That interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals, and their business ventures, are safe. Energy and Mining Minister Youcef Yousfi, who a day earlier insisted Algeria can keep its gas facilities secure without foreign forces' help, said he believes the targeted gas facility will be back running "in the shortest possible time" and that foreign workers will soon return. Several foreign companies, including Statoil and BP, evacuated their workers from Algeria after the incident. "I don't think that these workers have left definitively Algeria," Yousfi told reporters, according to the Algerian Press Service. "Maybe some left ... to reassure their families, but I want to ensure that no company or no worker permanently left the country." Nations mourn dead, try to account for others Here is a breakdown on the status of hostages from around the world who were involved in the crisis: Colombia Colombia's president said one of its citizens is presumed dead. France No known French hostages are unaccounted for, the defense ministry said. A man identified as Yann Desjeux died after telling French newspaper Sud Ouest  that he and 34 other hostages were treated well. It was unclear what led to his death. Japan Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Minoru Kiuchi and officials from JGC, a Yokohama-based engineering firm, saw and identified the bodies of seven Japanese citizens killed in the crisis, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga announced late Monday. Three Japanese remain unaccounted for, according to Suga. Malaysia Three hostages were on their way back home, state media reported. There is a "worrying possibility" that another is dead while a fifth is unaccounted for, the agency said.

United Kingdom Three British citizens were killed, the Foreign Office said Sunday. Three other British nationals and a UK resident are also "believed dead," according to British officials. The Foreign Office confirmed the name of one slain hostage, Garry Barlow, in a statement Monday. "Garry was a loving, devoted family man, he loved life and lived it to the full. He was very much loved by myself, his sons, mother and sister and the rest of his family and friends and will be greatly missed," the Foreign Office quoted his wife, Lorraine, as saying. Twenty-two other Britons who were taken hostage have safely returned home. United States U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland on Monday said three Americans had been killed and identified them as Victor Lynn Lovelady, Gordon Lee Rowan and Frederick Buttaccio, who had been previously identified. Seven U.S. citizens survived the crisis, added Nuland, who declined to comment further citing privacy considerations. Erin Lovelady described her father Victor, of Nederland, Texas, as a laid-back, understanding and loving man. "I want people to understand how wonderful my dad was, and how great a dad he was, and how much he's going to be missed by me and my mother and my brother," Erin Lovelady told CNN affiliate KFDM, describing herself as "daddy's little girl." Gwen Eckholm called Rowan -- her former neighbor in Mesa, Arizona, who recently moved to eastern Oregon -- a "very intelligent, super-nice guy" who told her he felt safe working in Algeria. He said "we're in a compound in the middle of nowhere, and we've got security, and I'll be fine," Eckholm told CNN affiliate KNXV. "I guess you can't really be secure any place."

A short-term spending measure to fund the federal government into next week won approval Thursday from the U.S. House and now goes to President Barack Obama's desk. The measure was part of a bipartisan agreement intended to end a dispute over disaster relief spending that threatened to cause a partial shutdown of the government when the current fiscal year ends at midnight Friday. Congressional approval of the measure keeps the government funded through October 4. The House will then have to consider a more comprehensive measure that would keep the government funded through November 18. With most House members away from Washington on a one-week recess, Thursday's approval took place at a "pro forma" session involving just three House members using a procedure known as "unanimous consent." Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and John Culberson of Texas conducted the House business, including the request for the chamber's unanimous consent of the spending plan, while Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland kept an eye on the proceedings. The Senate approved both measures Monday. Together, they would fund the federal government for the first seven weeks of the new fiscal year. The spending proposals contain an additional $2.65 billion in disaster relief needed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to replenish coffers depleted partly by the federal response to Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee, and a series of tornadoes and wildfires this year. The new emergency disaster funding will kick in Saturday. Democrats and Republicans had been at odds over a GOP demand to cut spending elsewhere to offset increased disaster relief funding in the current fiscal year. FEMA ended that standoff Monday when it indicated that it has enough money to get through the final few days of the current fiscal year. If Congress had failed to reach a new spending agreement, a partial government shutdown would have occurred with the onset of the new fiscal year on Saturday. Government shutdowns were also threatened during budget talks in the spring and the debt ceiling debate over the summer. The short-term funding measures were necessary because Congress has failed to complete its full budget appropriations process in recent years due to a sharp partisan divide over government spending issues. The November 18 extension expected to win final approval next week was intended to provide time to debate and pass appropriations bills for the remainder of fiscal year 2012. However, it's been more than 15 years since both chambers of Congress passed the full range of appropriations bills. Instead, they have relied on other ways to extend spending authority, such as continuing resolutions or omnibus measures that bundle together multiple appropriations bills. CNN's Tom Cohen and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.
Sanctions will be placed on 13 people and three companies "for their involvement in the A.Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network," the U.S. State Department said Monday. A.Q. Khan was the brains behind Pakistan's nuclear bomb. Khan, a Pakistani scientist, operated an international black market in nuclear material to a number of states with a history of poor relations with the United States. He was arrested in February 2004 and eventually pardoned by former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. The sanctions, which follow a U.S. review of the network, "will help prevent future proliferation-related activities by these private entities, provide a warning to other would-be proliferators, and demonstrate our ongoing commitment to using all available tools to address proliferation-related activities." The department notes that Khan spearheaded an "extensive international network for the proliferation of nuclear equipment and know-how that provided one-stop shopping for countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons." Iran and Libya received centrifuge components, centrifuges, and designs from Khan and his associates, and the United States believes the network "provided centrifuge designs, equipment, and technology to North Korea." The department said Khan "provided Libya with nuclear weapon designs." The department added that Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland and Malaysia are among the governments that have worked with the U.S. "to investigate and shut down the network." "Many of Dr. Khan's associates are either in custody, being prosecuted, or have been convicted of crimes," it said. "While we believe the A.Q. Khan network is no longer operating, countries should remain vigilant to ensure that Khan network associates, or others seeking to pursue similar proliferation activities, will not become a future source for sensitive nuclear information or equipment."

"So long, Lolong." That was the phrase echoing around social media on Monday after news emerged the night before that Lolong, the world's largest crocodile in captivity, had died in the southern Philippines. The outpouring of online shock and grief over the demise of the heavyweight reptile, which was more than 6-meters (20-feet) long, could be considered a little surprising, given suspicions Lolong may have been involved in at least two lethal attacks on people before he was captured in 2011. But his world-beating size earned him an entry in the Guinness World Records and drew tourists to his enclosure at the Davao Crocodile Park in a remote corner of the Philippine island of Mindanao. His death, the cause of which is still to be determined by a post-mortem, prompted tributes from top Philippine officials. Environment Secretary Ramon Paje called it a significant loss to the country's crocodile conservation program, describing Lolong as an "ambassador," according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN News. But the 1,075-kilo (2,370-pound) crocodile's legacy will live on, Paje said, since officials plan to preserve his capacious skin so that it can be stuffed and mounted. Wildlife authorities caught Lolong in September 2011, the result of a long effort to track him down after a young girl was reportedly killed in the Agusan Marsh on Mindanao in 2009. The later disappearance of a fisherman from the nearby village of Bunawan was also linked to crocodiles. Attacks on livestock were also reported. But it was unclear if Lolong, a saltwater crocodile, was responsible for the attacks, so authorities made him the star of the show at the crocodile park near Bunawan. He was reportedly named after local hunter Ernesto "Lolong" Conate, who died of a stroke while helping plan the capture of the gargantuan creature. Before the giant crocodile died, park attendants had noticed that his right stomach was bloated, Edwin Elorde, the mayor of Bunawan said, according to ABS-CBN. Elorde expressed support for the idea of preserving Lolong, so that villagers "can still see him."
Not every travel adventure involves tracking wild animals or hanging off a mountain. Some feats of endurance come in the form of festivals, and Munich's Oktoberfest is no exception. This annual beer-soaked event is under way now, but a visit to the charming Bavarian town of Munich is a treat year-round. Whether you're visiting in winter or in summer, there is sure to be plenty to do. Read on for tips in each season: Take in the scenery when it's cold CNN's Emma Lacey-Bordeaux shares her tips for cold-weather explorations: I arrived in Munich by train. The warm bright interiors of the train car and the boisterous passengers sharply contrasted with the increasingly snowy exterior as we left northern Italy, crossed the Alps and arrived in the neat metropolis. After spending four months studying in the incredibly beautiful yet utterly perplexing city of Venice, Italy, Munich stood out first and foremost for its order. Trains take you where you need to go, they run on time and the buildings all look like they could stand forever in their neat, thoughtful lines Walking, biking or taking public transport allows visitors to take in the interesting architecture of the city. The city exhibits modern platzes, or squares, with glass buildings, impressive monuments and historic buildings galore. Share your photos and tips for Munich Enjoy the Hofgarten, a lovely yet strangely haunting garden in the middle of the city replete with ornate buildings and statues. As is the case with many landmarks and buildings in this charming city, the garden was first constructed in the 17th century, then destroyed during World War II and rebuilt much the same. Around town, you'll notice some buildings with facades painted on to approximate a style lost in the war. Across town, pay a visit to Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. The main building was designed by Friedrich von Gärtner, an important architect from the mid 19th century, and features large beautiful halls. Plus a visit to a college area always pays off in good, cheap food options. Munich has a festival for every season. October boasts the übertraditional Oktoberfest, the summer months have outdoor concerts and Christmas carnivals fill the winter months. Keep these tips in mind if you go for the holiday markets: Rule No. 1, bundle up! The icy wind here comes off the mountains and will chill you to the core. Luckily, every outdoor Christmas market, or Christkindlmarkt, sells a variety of hot beverages including hot mulled wine or Glühwein. Don't be surprised when vendors hand you a beautiful ceramic mug full of wine. But don't walk away with the mug; you're just renting it. Return it after drinking and move on to the next market for more shopping and sipping. At the markets you'll find all manner of gifts and knickknacks from the classically Bavarian items to more modern crafts. The Tollwood Festival stands out as one of the largest in town. It also boasts musical and theatrical performances and a large variety of food from around the world. The No. 1 rule with these markets: pace yourself -- these warm oases in a cold season are all over town. Should market hopping make you ill, Munich has a very modern and well-run health care system. Perhaps I succumbed to the cold weather, the festival food or the bug that I heard was going around town, but whatever the reason, my host and I both found ourselves sick to the point of dehydration. After a quick train ride we arrived at an emergency room and were seen by a doctor almost immediately. The visit to a lovely doctor who spoke perfect English was a mere 35 Euro, including intravenous fluids. Afterward, I walked across the street, prescriptions in hand, shelled out 15 more Euro and felt right as rain. I never once showed ID or an insurance card. Getting sick should not rank high on your travel list, but if illness falls, fear not! Get outdoors and soak up the sun in summer Read on for some warm-weather finds from CNN's Emily Smith. Munich is delightful in the warmer months. Locals and tourists alike flood the streets and fill cafes. Take advantage of the weather and spend as much time outdoors as possible. We rented bikes from a tour company opposite the train station. Being a nervous biker I was pleasantly surprised that motorists moved over, and I never felt at all unsafe. We opted for a tour that included both historical stops as well as a visit to a few beer gardens. In Munich, beer is big business year-round and Hofbrauhaus is one of the oldest and most popular places to indulge. Beer maidens carry giant mugs of frothy golden goodness between tables crammed family-style with tourists from all over the world. The mood is jovial and spirited, and the schnitzel isn't half bad either. Most of the food found at beer gardens is real stick to your ribs-type stuff. We dined on giant pretzels and bratwurst for the most part. The Chinese Tower Beer Garden, in the large city park called the English Garden, is also a must-try. Located at the base of a wooden pagoda, seating is predominantly outdoors and there is often a live brass band. If you opt for a guided tour, listen well and you'll learn some interesting facts. For example, beer gardens used to store beer in underground cellars beneath the shade of chestnut trees. The English garden, with its many chestnut trees, is beautiful and definitely worth a walk around. It's rather expansive so plot out a route and be aware of the Schönfeldwiese lawn -- it's a favorite of nudists. No judgment! Another fun outdoor activity off the garden can be found at the Eisbach River. There you'll come across something unexpected -- surfers! The river forms a natural standing wave that draws board riders to get their fix. There's usually a crowd but patience is rewarded with a spot on the bridge overlooking the wave. The sport has become so popular that the location now boasts multiple wave riding competitions. It helps to have a tour guide in a city like Munich -- the city is large and while easy to navigate it's nice to have someone point out the pockmarked buildings from the war instead of walking right by with your nose glued to a map. The city has a rich cultural history and is home to world-class museums and galleries. Munich is the kind of city where it's easy to mix the fun of beer garden hopping with the opportunity to get your knowledge on.

In-form superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi go head-to-head in Monday night's El Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the Camp Nou, which is set to have a significant bearing on the Spanish title race. The world's most expensive player Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in Real's 5-1 thrashing of Athletic Bilbao in their last league outing, which kept them one point ahead of Barca, who crushed Almeria 8-0. Messi, the reigning FIFA world player of the year, also netted a hat-trick for the defending champions, who have beaten Real in their last four league meetings. Ronaldo, who was on the receiving end last season as his team were pipped by the Catalan giants for the title, does not expect history to be repeated with his compatriot Jose Mourinho now in charge at the Bernabeu. Capturing sport's biggest characters "It could be a decisive match as the two sides are so even and these games could decide the championship," the Portuguese told AFP. "It would be difficult for the losing team to take. "We are stronger than last season and we go into the match without losing a match and have a lot more confidence and solidity. "The team looks really good and the coach has given us a lot of confidence." Mourinho, like his Barcelona counterpart Pep Guardiola, has spent the pre-match build-up trying to downplay the significance of a victory for either side. "The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent," he told the official Real Madrid website. Blog: Are we in for the greatest El Clasico in history ? "Nevertheless, whatever happens, 25 league games will still remain. I expect a beautiful game in which players help the referee and true football takes center  stage," he added. And this from Guardiola, who will be hoping his team can capitalize on home advantage to make it five wins in a row in the biggest derby match of all. "This will not be decisive though, but whoever does win will surely be considered to be the champions for the next week at least," he told his club's official website. Mourinho is guaranteed a hot reception in the Camp Nou, having been a former assistant coach there under Bobby Robson before embarking on his incredible managerial career. "I don't see any coaches worrying about how they may be received. My concentration won't falter if the stands are against me. I don't care. I just want to play football and enjoy it. That's all," claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season. Both teams are expected to be a virtual full strength, with the home side having a doubt over Gaby Milito, who missed training Sunday, while Kaka remains sidelined for Real Madrid. Ronaldo, who tops the La Liga scoring charts with 15, just ahead of Messi, claims the match is so much more than an individual battle between the pair. "Talking about a duel between myself and Messi is nonsense," Ronaldo. "I am just one player and I don't think I have more pressure than my teammates. We all have the responsibility to perform well. "I am not obsessed by scoring goals and I am not obsessed by scoring against Barcelona." Argentina ace Messi has scored in three out of their last four victories over Real, including a double in their 6-2 rout in the Bernabeu two seasons ago. "Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind," Messi told AFP. "Since the 6-2 at the Bernabeu I guess they have a real desire to beat us and this season they have strengthened with the new signings and (Jose) Mourinho." The return El Clasico will see Real entertain Barca on the weekend of April 16/17 in the title run-in.
In an age when Russian oligarchs and Arab Sheikhs spend billions of dollars on forging the perfect dream team, fan ownership has become a novelty for many of Europe's top soccer clubs. But it is a route that might just be the salvation of struggling Spanish team Real Oviedo, thanks to a social media campaign that has gone viral. Once a top-flight contender with La Liga heavyweights Real Madrid and Barcelona, the 86-year-old club -- based in the northern mining region of Asturias -- has until Saturday to raise €1.9 million ($2.4 million) or face extinction. So far Oviedo has received over €1 million in a period of just nine days -- with €274,000 coming from those who heard about it via Twitter, according to board member Juan Ramon. There is a Twitter hashtag set up -- #saverealoviedo. The football community is also doing its part to save the third division club, whose "cantera" youth academy -- or quarry -- is responsible for unearthing some of the gems of Spanish football. Names such as World Cup winner Juan Mata, Arsenal's little magician Santi Cazorla and Swansea's star striker Michu are all graduates. The English Premier League stars have joined forces to help save their former club, while Real Madrid legend Raul has bought €1,000 worth shares to keep Oviedo in business. Real Oviedo and Sporting de Gijon are the two major clubs in Asturias, once the heartland of Spanish coal mining and one of the country's most prosperous regions. But its coal industry has receded and the European debt crisis has engulfed Spain. Substantial investment has been hard to find as the Spanish government grapples with harsh austerity measures and chronic unemployment. In a desperate attempt to salvage the club and guarantee its future in the short term, the board of directors announced a share issue earlier this month to attract investment. The scheme -- open to anyone with a spare €11 ($13) -- has become an instant Twitter sensation, and football fans around the world have been quick to show their support by purchasing shares. However, Spanish football expert and long-time Real Oviedo supporter Sid Lowe says he is unsure whether the social-network campaign will be enough to save the club before the looming deadline. Lowe -- who has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of Oviedo's plight among football fans -- told CNN the worldwide response from supporters is "absolutely astonishing." Last week, queues formed outside the club's 30,000-seater stadium, the Estadio Carlos Tartiere, as fans clamored to buy a stake in their beloved club. "The financial target is quite modest in football terms ... but serious investment for the club is very hard to find, particularly in a place like Asturias," Lowe said. 'A perfect storm' After 13 consecutive seasons in La Liga, Oviedo dropped to the second division in 2001. The real turmoil began in 2003, when mismanagement from the club's directors bought the Asturian team to the brink of bankruptcy. The boardroom turned into a political battlefield as relationships soured, aggravated by a series of poor performances on the field, according to Real Oviedo shareholder Rodolfo Diaz. Diaz -- an Oviedo supporter since the 1970s and a season ticket-holder for over 20 years -- has stuck with the club through good times and bad. He told CNN that 2003 was like a "perfect storm" for Oviedo. "In modern times, Real Oviedo has been a victim of greed and businessmen who wanted to make profits quickly," he said. Today, Diaz is pleased to see that control of the club is back in the hands of the supporters and that football fans globally are buoying the club through charitable donations. "As a linguist, football is that universal language that we all speak and we all understand. It allows us to bond," he said. "This bad situation has generated a very positive spirit through Twitter." Club ownership Real Oviedo is not the only Spanish club to embrace shareholder power. Barcelona -- touted as the best football team in the world -- is governed by a group of fans called the "socis." In return for an annual fee of €140, members are tasked with electing the club president and voting on matters affecting the side. In Germany, it is a requirement for clubs in the league -- known as the Bundesliga -- to be 51% owned by supporters or members to ensure they're managed responsibly. Ramon believes an influx of shareholder fans provides a "great opportunity" and can create a more financially stable and healthy environment for football teams. "Across Europe, a movement is developing that aims to promote the influence of fans at football clubs," he told CNN. On November 7, Supporters Direct Europe, the association of European football fans, presented a list of recommendations to the European Parliament in Brussels, including greater involvement for supporters in their clubs and financial fair play. "The social role of football is of great importance," said Ivo Belet, a member of European Parliament involved with the movement. "This is the reason supporters should have a say in the management of their clubs." Uncertain future for Oviedo Although the future of Real Oviedo remains far from certain, Diaz says he would expect nothing less of the club he has followed since he was a boy. "It is quite a poetic situation -- a club on the verge of extinction -- and I think in the last minutes everything will be solved. In injury time, we will come out fighting and gain victory." Diaz thinks Real Oviedo will play until the end of this season, even if the club does not meet its November 17 deadline -- when the team faces a tough trip away to the reserve side of second-placed La Liga club Atletico Madrid. "It's the same of story for the fans, we will suffer to the very end."
While several high-profile actors and directors have rallied around Roman Polanski, not everyone in Hollywood believes he should be freed and forgiven. The case surrounding the arrest of director Roman Polanski has both supporters and critics. In the face of a  petition signed by notables such as Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and John Landis calling for the immediate release of Polanski following his detainment in Switzerland, a backlash is building against such support. "I can't believe that Hollywood has separated itself so completely from American morality," said Paul Petersen, a former child actor and president of A Minor Consideration, which advocates on behalf of young performers. "It is yet another case of Hollywood being out of sync with most of America." Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, but fled the United States before he could be sentenced. In the years since, the director known for "Chinatown" and "Rosemary's Baby" settled in France and avoided authorities until he was arrested Saturday while on his way to the Zurich Film Festival. In the aftermath of Polanski's arrest last weekend, a number of performers -- including Penelope Cruz, Tilda Swinton and Monica Bellucci -- appear as supporters on a petition which states, "Roman Polanski is a French citizen, a renown and international artist now facing extradition. This extradition, if it takes place, will be heavy in consequences and will take away his freedom." Polanski's detention has stirred debate over whether he should be returned to the United States to face possible imprisonment. Supporters make note of his age, the years that have passed, his talent and the victim's own assertion that pursuing the case opens fresh wounds for her as reasons the director should be left alone. But critics observe that Polanski's supporters might be downplaying his crime. "I don't think a lot of people take the sexual assault of children very seriously at all, and it's something we battle everyday," said Grier Weeks, executive director of Protect, a national organization to protect children. "We say at Protect that we are the most bipartisan group in America because we've got everyone from Hollywood liberals like Alison Arngrim [Nellie Oleson] from 'Little House on the Prairie' to extremely conservative people. ... But I will say with the notable exception of a few people from Hollywood, we get blank stares from some of that crowd." Weeks pointed to the example of a discussion on ABC's "The View," in which panelist and actress Whoopi Goldberg made the comment that she didn't believe the original charges against Polanski were for "rape-rape," as what he views as a pervasive attitude. "I assume [Goldberg] regrets saying what she said, but she really didn't say anything that is not under the surface anyway," Weeks said. "This is just the attitude, that children are property and crimes against them are not real crimes."  Watch a discussion of about Polanski's supporters » Goldberg's fellow panelist, Sherri Shepherd, said during the show that she believed Polanski should still be punished. On Twitter, she tweeted, "Whew... long day at 'The View'... two shows today... hot debate over the Statutory Rapist Polanski. 45-year-old man plies a 13-yr-old w/drugs & Liquor and anally & orally penetrates her w/o her consent is a RAPIST. We hunt down 75-year-old Nazis. We must protect our children." Actress Kirstie Alley wrote on Twitter "JUST FOR THE RECORD....RAPE IS RAPE...this is one HOLLYWOOD STAR who does not CELEBRATE or DEFEND Roman Polanski..his ART did not RAPE her." "The Biggest Loser" trainer Jillian Michaels said "If she's [the victim] OK and feels that they are resolved then who are we to say" referring to the now adult victim, Samantha Geimer. Despite that, Michaels said, "If somebody drugged and raped my 13-year-old I'd shoot them."  Watch stars discuss Polanski's arrest » Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said it is understandable that Geimer would want to move on given what has occurred. "I think that it's deplorable that some celebrities, and I emphasis the word 'some,' are supporting rape, supporting the destruction of the life of a 13-year-old girl," O'Neill said. "You look at what happened to the victim in this case and how she was re-victimized over and over again. First by [Polanski] himself when he claimed it was consensual, then by his pals all powerful, wealthy celebrities who supported him, then by the media who characterized her as the little Lolita, the 13-year-old temptress." Petersen, who played son Jeff Stone on "The Donna Reed Show," said he believes there are many in the industry who would like to speak up against the support Polanski has received. "They are afraid of the Hollywood power structure that is tilted distinctly to the left and plays favorites," Petersen said. Thomas J. Reese, S.J., a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, wrote a piece for The Washington Post's "On Faith" column titled "Father Polanski Would Go to Jail." Reese said Hollywood might learn a lesson from the scandals involving pedophiles and the Catholic Church. "I think that perhaps there is a sense of entitlement that comes with being a celebrity and a star and part of that whole industry where people are always fawning over them and idolizing them," Reese said. "I think that kind of goes to your head and makes you think that you are special and above the law. The clergy used to think that at one time, inaccurately, and it's just not a healthy attitude." On Wednesday, the BBC reported that the French government had dropped its public support for the release of Polanski stating that the director "is neither above nor beneath the law."
Claudio Marchisio's late double gave Juventus a 2-0 win over reigning champions AC Milan Sunday to go back to the top of the Serie A standings. The game in Turin looked set to end in a draw until Marchisio scored three minutes from time then added a late second to seal three points which put Juve ahead of Udinese on goal scored. Defeat continued Milan's poor start to the campaign and they lanquish in 15th, two places and a point ahead of arch-rivals Inter. Juventus created a number of openings to break the deadlock but with the clock counting down made the breakthrough. Marchisio went for a one-two with Mirko Vucinic but in trying to intercept Milan's Daniele Bonera only succeeded in slamming the ball onto Marchisio's foot and into the net. In injury time, Marchisio beat Christian Abbiati with a long range strike which the goalkeeper should have saved. Earlier, Udinese kept pace with a 2-0 win over Bologna as Mehdi Benatia gave them the lead on 29 minutes. Captain Antonio Di Natale scored the second from the penalty spot after Pablo Armero had been fouled. Napoli are a point behind in third following a fine 3-0 win at 10-man Inter Saturday. Meanwhile in the German Bundesliga Sunday, coach Huub Stevens made a winning start for Schalke as they won 2-1 at Hamburg. Klaas Jan Huntelaar opened the scoring after 13 minutes only for Mladen Petric to level seven minutes before the break. Dutch ace Huntelaar grabbed the winner with 17 minutes left. In the other match played, Werder Bremen failed in their bid to join Bayern Munich at the top of the table as they were beaten 3-2 by Hanover. Mohammed Abdellaoue scored a hat-trick for Hanover, who held on despite a late Claudio Pizarro goal for Bremen.
Scary thought -- with more than 98 million single people in the United States alone, you're simply one of many fish in the sea. Even scarier -- after years of searching for that special someone, "The One" might reject YOU because you're not "The One" for them. British relationship expert Roy Sheppard has a new book, "How to Be The One," explaining how to strengthen your emotional core through four pillars -- self esteem, attitude, happiness and kindness/compassion -- in order to make sure you're ready for that moment. "Thanks to the internet, there's now a new addiction... dating," he said. "It's never been so easy to get a date. But with so many people to choose from, there's always the possibility that there's someone out there who's 'better.' " Sheppard says that if you focus on improving each pillar, you'll have a better chance of catching "The One's" attention when they meet you. Before you become, as he writes, the ex in "next." The following is an edited interview with the author: CNN: Why is it important to focus on being "The One" instead of finding "The One"? Sheppard: There are LOADS of books around that teach you how to get a date or find "The One." Yet men and women are still searching. Being "The One" doesn't ever involve being manipulative or deceitful to trap your target into a relationship. It's about being a decent human being and a trustworthy, committed best friend. You can't fake that. The book focuses on helping men and women recognize how to be a genuinely appealing person for a long-term, happy relationship with someone else. CNN: Sum up the book for us in a sentence -- how does someone become "The One"? Sheppard: By choosing to be a more appealing person on the inside, learning the skills to acquire a healthy self-esteem, a great can-do, supportive attitude, an inner happiness that's not dependent on anyone else "completing you." CNN: Not to stereotype, but I rarely hear guys say "The One" in a serious context. Do you think many men will read the book? Sheppard: Most relationship books are written by women for women. In many cases they complain that men don't "get it" about relationships. The only problem is they don't invite men to be a part of the conversation. If you're a woman, why not mention this topic to guys. Ask them "What would YOU do to be 'The One' for someone else?" If their eyes glaze over and they're not at all interested in even talking about it, it could be an early indication that a long-term relationship isn't part of their agenda. CNN: Of the four emotional core pillars, which is most important and why? Sheppard: That's a bit like asking "Which muscle in your leg is the most important? They are all important -- especially when they work together. Improved self-esteem leads to a more appealing attitude, which helps us all become happier people. It's only when you're happy can you be a kind person. As I write in the book, it is impossible to be unhappy and loving at the same time. CNN: You say in the book that dates are auditions for intimacy. What does that mean? Sheppard: I've defined dates as "auditions for intimacy" because if you think about it, that's precisely what dates are. When people date they assess whether they might want to be intimate with that person -- this week, month, year or for decades. Invest time developing your emotional core. You'll pass more "auditions," which will open up far more options to you. You'll be able to share the limelight with an A-list partner in a blockbuster relationship, rather than a low-budget soap opera. CNN: You speak a lot about honesty, playing games and faking it. What's the bottom line there? Sheppard: Manipulation or game-playing is for desperately deceitful people who have convinced themselves that there's a shortcut to a long relationship. Long-lasting, happy and intimate relationships are always based on mutual honesty, respect, trust and commitment. CNN: What are the biggest complaints you hear from men about women and from women about men? Sheppard: Some men and women spend their entire lives insisting that they "see the manager." It's their default setting. Nothing is EVER right for them. They have a problem because invariably they have created what they think the scenario should be in their heads, then when reality fails to conform to that, they kick up a fuss about it! As far as specifics go, it's usually a variation on "He/she won't do what I want." This is what I describe in the book as "first position" thinking. Successful relationships are based on "second position" thinking and behavior. Second position is having the capacity to experience what it would be like being that other person. CNN: Throughout the book you talk about how no one else is responsible for how you're feeling, your attitude or your love. Why is that? Sheppard: So many people allow their downbeat emotions to dominate their lives. Human beings are much bigger than that. We can consciously decide how happy we are going to be. It's a decision -- give it a go. Someone who learns to think like that becomes more appealing to others ... and themselves. CNN: Once you've found "The One," how do you keep them? Sheppard: A flippant answer would be -- you don't. THEY decide to keep you. In order to be someone a partner would choose to keep, you need to build up, over a long period of time, proof that you are dependable, considerate, reliable, supportive, kind and loving. This happens as a direct result of developing your emotional core. It's just like a career. Some people take their careers seriously, others don't. Those who want a successful career work towards acquiring the necessary skills to be the best they can be. They prepare for their interviews (or auditions!) and work hard. Those who can't be bothered don't get the best jobs, are forced to accept poor pay, and if over time they shirk their responsibilities, they usually get fired. A successful, long-term relationship requires effort from both parties. Every day. CNN: Why is there a goldfish on the cover of your book? Sheppard: Whenever you break up with someone, invariably a well-meaning friend will say "Cheer up, there are plenty more fish in the sea." That may be the case, but you want to be the only ONE fish! So many female friends tried insisting that the cover had an image of a swan or a pair of love birds because they all mate for life. But no guy is ever going to read a book on the subway with love birds on the cover! It therefore had to be something that was gender neutral.
CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on "Inside Politics" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. One last Campaign 2014 maneuver and several intriguing post-election shifts and calculations made for a fun trip around the table. 1. New ground troops -- in Louisiana There is one more round in the 2014 election, and Republicans are heavily favored: the Louisiana runoff for the U.S. Senate between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy. So put this one in the "taking nothing for granted" file: A GOP source tells CNN the Republican National Committee is sending in 350 field workers to help with the December 6 get-out-the-vote effort. Democrats, too, say they will bolster their staff there now that all the other campaigns are over. But Landrieu faces a bigger question: whether to invite President Obama down for the runoff. He has been persona non grata during the election, but many party strategists think Landrieu's only chance is sky-high African-American turnout. 2. Watch out, McConnell: Cruz's 2015 plans If Mitch McConnell, the presumed new Senate majority leader, is ever trying to find Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, he might just want to turn and look over his shoulder. The freshman tea party favorite makes no bones about believing that McConnell is too establishment and too accommodating. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times chatted with Cruz on election night and came away with the distinct impression Cruz will be tracking every McConnell move. "I asked him about whether or not the party should try to sort of back off the repeal of the Affordable Care Act or try to compromise on immigration," said Martin. "He said emphatically not, and in fact he said the only way to keep faith with the folks that elected them was to stand by the issues that had done so. And he said the biggest two issues for his party of the cycle were, A, repealing Obamacare, as he called it, and B, stopping the President's illegal executive action, as he called it, on immigration." Next year, Martin points out, McConnell might be wishing Cruz finds himself in Iowa more often than in Washington. 3. And memo to McConnell: Enjoy it while you can It long has been his dream job. Now, as McConnell prepares to rise to majority leader, the 2016 lineup suggests he might want to savor every minute. Politico's Manu Raju notes that the 2016 map is to Republicans what the 2014 map was to Democrats -- as in tough. "There are a number of Republican senators that we are going to be looking at very closely on whether or not they decide to run again," said Raju. "People like Richard Burr of North Carolina, Dan Coats of Indiana, Mark Kirk in Illinois. There are several others -- Chuck Grassley in Iowa." Raju notes that if those GOP senators retire, then the Democrats have a chance to take those seats -- and maybe take back the Senate majority. 4. How Obama tries to get over a bad election -- head to Asia Asia trips are a long haul -- a drain on any president. But Obama perhaps is dreading this one a little less, because it gets him out of a Washington buzzing about how the midterm election further weakened his political clout. So off he goes, but not without reminders that news travels fast these days. Julie Pace of The Associated Press notes that the Chinese, before they roll out the red carpet, apparently are eager to tell their people it is a weakened U.S. president coming to visit. "Officials are right now increasingly nervous about the reception he is going to get in China," said Pace. "There's a newspaper in China that's connected to the government that wrote a story before he left saying that the American public had 'downgraded' the President and was tired of his 'banality.'" 5. Same leaders on Capitol Hill but ... Debbie Wasserman Schultz faced buzz in the middle of the campaign that the White House was less than thrilled with her performance as Democratic National Committee chairwoman. Now, as Democrats sort through the rubble of the results from their perspective, the ambitious Florida congresswoman is getting even more heat from fellow Democrats. Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post took us inside the debate over whether -- or when -- the DNC would be under new leadership. "She has said she wants to serve out her term -- it ends in January 2017 -- and in some ways there's questions about whether or not she's close enough to Hillary Clinton, and whether she'd want her to stay on," said Henderson. "But it'll be interesting to see whether or not she's able to stick it out or move on."
The parents of an American journalist missing in Syria have a new message for his captors: "Let us be a whole family again." In a statement published Thursday on the McClatchy Newspapers website, Austin Tice's parents say he went to Syria to share the stories of the country's people. "We urge you, whoever you are: Let Austin come home for Christmas," Marc and Debra Tice wrote. "Let us hug him, laugh and cry with him, love him in person." Austin Tice, who was working as a freelancer for McClatchy and other news outlets, last contacted his family on August 13 while in Syria reporting on the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's government. He was reportedly preparing to leave Syria for Lebanon when he went missing, according to his family. Read more: Syrian government denies holding missing journalist, father says In Thursday's statement, Marc and Debra Tice describe their son as someone who has "a special affinity for the people of the Middle East." "He is especially attracted to your tradition of hospitality," the statement said. "He deeply connects with your intense loyalty to family, faith and ideals." The U.S. State Department has said they believe Tice was detained by Syrian officials in August as he was preparing to leave the country. He had smuggled himself into the country to report on the uprising. In November, Marc Tice told reporters that the Syrian government had told his family that it doesn't know where their son is. In October, a shaky video surfaced on YouTube showing a man believed to be Tice surrounded by armed men walking him up a hill. State Department officials have questioned the veracity of the video, which purports to show Tice in the custody of rebels fighting the Syrian government. Read more: Video appears to show missing U.S. journalist blindfolded and in distress Earlier this month, Tice's parents told CNN they do not want to speculate about who is holding him; they just want their son back home. Austin is the oldest of the couple's seven children. "He likes to know what's going on in the world," Debra Tice said earlier this month, and he was frustrated by the lack firsthand reporting from Syria's civil war. She said her son had reassured her that it was worth it to travel to Syria. "I'm someone that can go," he told her. "I can face that danger because this story is important.'" CNN's Elwyn Lopez, Claire Calzonetti, Samuel Burke and Mick Krever contributed to this report.
The Des Moines, Iowa, woman named the world's oldest living person this month has died, according to her family. Dina Manfredini died overnight at the retirement center where she lived after suffering a fever, her granddaughter Lori Logli said Monday. She was 115 and apparently died in her sleep, Logli said. Guinness World Records identified Manfredini as the world's oldest person on December 5, a day after the death of 116-year-old Besse Cooper of Georgia. Manfredini was born in Pievepelago, Italy, on April 4, 1897, and moved to Des Moines in 1920 with her husband, according to her Guinness biography. She was an avid gardener who, after staying home to raise children and keep house, took up a job at the age of 90 cleaning houses, according to Guinness. She lived on her own until she was 110, when she moved to a nursing home, Guinness said. Guinness quoted Manfredini as saying that her long life was the result of her commitment to "hard work and everything in moderation."
Three suicide attackers shot their way onto the grounds of a five-star hotel in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar and set off a car bomb, killing at least seven people and wounding dozens, officials said. Pakistani police gather at the five-star hotel destroyed by a car bomb. Peshawar Police Chief Safwat Ghyour said about 40 people were wounded in the attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel, which is often frequented by foreigners and diplomats. The blast inflicted severe damage on the building, which is surrounded by a security wall, and destroyed dozens of cars in the parking lot, police and witnesses said. The information minister for Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, put the death toll at 11, with at least 50 wounded. A local official, Sahib Zada Muhammad Anis Khan, said one of the dead was a Nigerian national who worked for the United Nations. Qhazi Jamil, senior superintendent of Peshawar police, told CNN three gunmen in a pickup fired on security guards at the hotel's entrance gate and forced their way inside before setting off the bomb. Hussain and the chief of Peshawar's bomb-disposal squad said the bomb contained about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives. Peshawar is the capital of North West Frontier Province, which has suffered a spate of bombings on civilian targets in the wake of the Pakistani military's ongoing military offensive against Taliban militants. Sajjan Gohel, an international security analyst at the Asia-Pacific Foundation in Britain, said the blast appeared to be a response to the government's offensive. "It has been criticized very heavily in the tribal areas because of the fact that the Pakistani military has been using helicopter gunships against the Taliban, which has resulted in very high civilian casualties," Gohel said. He said people in the region are sympathetic to the Taliban, the Islamic militia that ruled most of Afghanistan before the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington by its al Qaeda allies. "This is where winning hearts and minds is so key and important, which the military are failing to do," he said. However, hundreds of Pakistani villagers who have formed an anti-Taliban militia are currently fighting to remove the Islamic militants from their region of northwestern Pakistan, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN. Abbas told CNN the Pakistani military is supporting the villagers, who turned against the Taliban after a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers left at least 40 dead. The Pearl Continental is owned by the same group as the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, which was destroyed in a suicide truck bombing in September.

including family members and health care professionals -- have been monitored and show no symptoms or fevers, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Saturday. "We have already gotten well over 100 inquiries of possible patients," Frieden told reporters. "We've assessed every one of those ... and just this one patient has tested positive ... We expect that we will see more rumors or concerns or possibilities of cases, until there is a positive laboratory test, that is what they are." Health officials did not provide details on the location of those being monitored or where they interacted with Duncan. Monitoring includes a visit from a public health expert and temperature checks twice a day. None of them has had symptoms of Ebola so far, according to Lakey. The latest figure is a drastic reduction of a number that started at 100 after initial talks with Duncan and hospital officials. Duncan landed in Dallas on September 20, and started feeling sick days later. He made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25. He was released with antibiotics but went back three days later and was quickly isolated. A blood test Tuesday confirmed he had Ebola, the first case of the deadly virus diagnosed on American soil. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Relocated to undisclosed location "We've been very busy the last 24 hours trying to make sure that everyone who has had potential exposure is identified and they have been evaluated," Lakey said. The high-risk list likely includes Duncan's partner, Louise, her 13-year-old son and her two 20-something nephews. The four had been holed up in the apartment Duncan lived in before he was hospitalized. They were relocated to an undisclosed place Friday, and will be required to stay there until October 19. The incubation period -- time between Ebola infection and the onset of symptoms -- ranges between two to 21 days. The Dallas hospital where Duncan is being treated has come under fire for its handling of his first visit there eight days ago. Louise, who does not want her last name used, said Duncan told hospital staff he had a fever and abdominal pain, and had recently arrived from Liberia -- key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola. Health care workers around the nation "have to learn from the experience," Lakey said Saturday. "The travel history is very important to take and it has to be communicated," he said. The hospital defended its handling of the case. "As a standard part of the nursing process, the patient's travel history was documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health record, including within the physician's workflow," it said in a statement. Your Ebola questions answered Plans to get married The church Louise attends said Duncan came to the United States so the two could get married. Louise told the church's senior pastor, George Mason, about their marriage plan, according to Mark Wingfield, a spokesman at the Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas. How the Ebola virus spreads Other Ebola scares As nervous Dallas residents watch Duncan's case unfold, more Ebola scares popped up in other parts of the nation. Howard University Hospital in Washington said Friday it had admitted a low-risk patient with symptoms that could be associated with Ebola, but health officials on Saturday said Ebola had been ruled out in that case. The unnamed patient had recently traveled to Nigeria. In Liberia, NBC News freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo was diagnosed with Ebola on Thursday, and is expected to leave Monrovia for the United States on Sunday aboard a private charter plane. In addition to Guinea and Sierra Leone, Liberia is one of three nations battling the deadly virus that has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa. Complete coverage on Ebola
Airbus has showed off its new A350 XWB, rolling out its first flyable plane on Monday fresh from the paintshop in company livery. The aircraft is the first in a family of super efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head against rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s. "XWB" means "extra wide body." There are three members in the A350 family: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers respectively, in three-class seating. The largest of the three lightweight carbon-composite aircraft, the A350-1000, is 73.88 meters long and has a range of approximately 8,400 nautical miles, or 15,600 kilometers. The catalog price is US$320.6 million. As of March 31, there were 110 orders for the A350-1000 among a total of 616 orders from 34 customers. Most orders, 414, have been for the A350-900. The plane unveiled on Monday at Airbus HQ in Toulouse, France is the latest milestone in what has been a turbulent production history for the A350. Critics have said the A350 program -- first launched in 2007 -- was a poorly-designed, hasty response to Boeing's 787. Dreamliner battery fix: Behind the scenes "The company, which was hip-deep in sorting out A380 development, simply hadn't foreseen the huge pent-up demand for a more efficient 250-seat airliner, and tried to take the easy way out by offering a re-engined version of its A330," aviation journalist David Kaminski-Morrow, air transport editor of Flightglobal.com, told CNN in an earlier report. Airbus reworked the design, configurations and technology to increase the plane's range and efficiency. The unveiled plane, which Airbus have tagged "MSN001," will undergo final tests before its maiden flight expected in June. Airbus said it took less than a week to complete the aircraft painting. Last month, engines were installed, ground vibration tests and flight test instrumentation verification were completed. Read more: What does the A350 mean for travelers?
A 47-year-old Virginia man was charged Monday with interfering with a flight crew during a flight last week in which he allegedly became intoxicated and unruly, leading authorities to scramble fighter jets and the pilot to make an emergency landing. The incident occurred Friday when Muhammad Abu Tahir, a Pakistani national and lawful permanent U.S. resident of Glen Allen, Virginia, was aboard AirTran Airways Flight 39 from Atlanta, Georgia, to San Francisco, California. During the flight, a flight attendant served Tahir, seated in coach, three airplane-serving-sized bottles of wine, then refused to serve him more, according to a two-page affidavit filed Monday by the FBI. He appealed to the senior flight attendant, who granted him a fourth, then a fifth bottle, both of which he downed quickly, it said. Tahir then went to a bathroom in the rear of the plane and closed the door, opening it a few minutes later and placing his shoes and socks outside the door, then retreating back inside, the affidavit said. "A short time later, Tahir again opened the lavatory door revealing that he was shaving with no shirt on," it added. When a flight attendant knocked on the door and encouraged him to leave the bathroom so others could use it, Tahir refused "and started yelling at the flight attendant that he was being disrespected," it said. Notified of the passenger's behavior, the captain advised the senior flight attendant to enlist the help of a passenger to stand outside the lavatory in case help was needed, it said. But Tahir continued yelling and refused to obey the crew, at one point grabbing the senior flight attendant by her arms and hands, releasing her only after a passenger interceded, the affidavit said. By this time, a fire extinguisher had been carried to the rear of the plane for possible use against the man and a beverage cart was repositioned to contain Tahir, according to the affidavit . While Tahir remained inside the lavatory, the pilot made an emergency landing in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where police officers took Tahir to the El Paso County Jail, where he remained Monday. Tahir told the FBI that he felt he was being disrespected when the flight attendants denied his request for food, which was being served in business class, the affidavit said. The charges Tahir faces will be read Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Denver and a detention hearing and preliminary hearing are to be scheduled for later in the week. "It is crucial that the flying public obey the commands of the flight crew," said U.S. Attorney David Gaouette. If convicted, Tahir faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, or both, as well as restitution to the airline. The incident was the second in three days in which North American Aerospace Defense Command fighter jets were scrambled in response to a passenger deemed disruptive. On Wednesday, NORAD escorted a Hawaii-bound plane back to its origination city of Portland, Oregon, after a passenger gave a flight attendant a note that was interpreted as being threatening. The passenger, Joseph Hedlund Johnson, 56, told the FBI he hadn't intended to scare anyone with the note, which began, "I thought I was going to die," and referenced the television show "Gilligan's Island."
Sir Robert Edwards, a "co-pioneer" of the in vitro fertilization technique and Nobel Prize winner, died Wednesday in his sleep after a long illness, the University of Cambridge said. He was 87. Edwards, a professor at the university and fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, and Dr. Patrick Steptoe developed the fertility treatment, which involves fertilizing an egg outside the womb and implanting the newly created embryo inside a woman's uterus. Their work resulted in the birth of Louise Brown on July 25, 1978 -- the world's first "test-tube baby." Since then, an estimated 5 million babies have been born worldwide thanks to IVF, according to the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies, an international nonprofit organization. When Brown married in 2004, Edwards attended the wedding. Steptoe died in 1988. Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010 for his work in developing the technique. The next year, he was knighted "for services to human reproductive biology," the university said in a statement. Both Edwards and Steptoe faced intense publicity and criticism from those opposed to the method, including the Vatican, after Brown's birth, according to the statement. Could 'personhood' bills outlaw IVF? "Bob Edwards is one of our greatest scientists," said Mike Macnamee, chief executive of Bourn Hall, the IVF clinic Edwards and Steptoe co-founded, in the statement. "His inspirational work in the early '60s led to a breakthrough that has enhanced the lives of millions of people worldwide. He is held in great affection by everyone who has worked with him and was treated by him." Dr. Linda C. Giudice, president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said in a statement that Edwards "was a great scientist whose stellar scientific work advanced our understanding of human reproduction, human embryonic stem cells, advanced pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and revolutionized the treatment of infertility. "We extend our condolences to his family, and his many friends around the world."
To see her playing with her friends, Maya Lama seems much like any other child. But until last year, the 12-year-old Nepalese girl led a very different existence, forced to work grueling 16-hour shifts in a carpet factory in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Maya's ordeal began in 2011 when, as a 10 year old, she came to the city for a visit with her uncle. Little did she know he would force her into becoming one of the country's estimated 1.6 million child laborers, putting her to work in exchange for money to give her parents. For the next year, instead of going to school, she said she was made to work from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. everyday, with barely any breaks. Like Maya, Yangzee Sherpa from Taplejung in northeastern Nepal was also coerced to join the workforce at an early age. She said her grandfather brought her to the capital to work because the family needed money. "My father was an alcoholic and my mother couldn't take care of me," said the 12 year old. "I don't know why they sent me to work while my two brothers went to school." Nepal's underage workers Though child labor is illegal in Nepal, an estimated 1.6 million children between the ages of five and 17 years are in the work force, according to the National Child Labor Report. About three-quarters of them are under the age of 14, and most are girls. Child workers are a frequent sight on Kathmandu's streets, whether cleaning dishes in local restaurants or making a living as conductors on the city's public transport. Many are employed in the carpet, brick and garment industries, or in private homes as domestic workers. Employers typically see the relationship as a mutually beneficial arrangement, providing the children accommodation and education, as well as a salary that supports their families, said Krishna Hari Pushkar, director general of Nepal's Department of Labor. Though working as underage domestic help is defined as child labor, there is a mutual agreement between the children, their parents and the employers, Pushkar said, referring to it as "social adoption." Rescued from forced labor Thousands of children continue to work as breadwinners for their families. Maya and Yangzee are some of the lucky ones. They were rescued by Nepal Goodweave Foundation, a local non-governmental organization that works to eradicate child labor within the carpet industry. Today, they live with more than 30 other children, all under 14, at the foundation's transit home in Kathmandu. A regular day at this hostel-like facility is filled with children chattering, playing and attending classes. But when they sit and share their past, an eerie hush falls over the room. While Nepal's Interim Constitution of 2007 guarantees the rights of children, and the country has signed major international conventions against child labor, enforcement is weak. Under its National Master Plan on Child Labor, the country has identified the worst forms of child labor -- bonded labor, domestic child labor and carpet weaving among them -- and aims to eliminate them by 2016. It hopes to eliminate all other forms of child labor by 2020. In a recent address during World Day Against Child Labour, Hanaa Singer, country representative of the United Nations Children's Fund to Nepal, said that addressing the issue should be a priority. However, she said the country lacks the number of labor inspectors necessary to effectively monitor child labor practices in illegal factories, or in residential situations where children are often employed as domestic helpers. Recently, protests rocked Nepal's capital following the death of a 12-year-old girl who was working as a domestic helper in the neighboring district of Lalitpur. Srijana Chaudary, a former kamlari or bonded laborer, self-immolated in March because of her perceived academic failures, according to her employers' testimony to the police. While police ruled her death a suicide, activists argued that the girl was ill-treated and her employers should be held accountable for her death. In response to the public outcry, the government agreed to form a committee to investigate the case. Its report is still to be released. The modern problem of kamlari While forms of bonded labor have existed in Nepal for centuries, the contemporary kamlari issue stems from the 1950s, when the eradication of malaria in the country's Terai region led migrants from other parts of the country to move in and occupy land traditionally owned by the Tharu ethnic community. With no legal records of their traditional land ownership, the Tharus were forced to become agricultural laborers for their new landlords and many were forced into debt. Many Tharu girls as young as five were sold into indentured domestic servitude by their families as a way of repaying the debts, where they could experience years of unpaid menial labor, violence and abuse, according to Shanta Chaudhary, herself a former kamlari. When Nepal officially banned the practice in 2000, an estimated 200,000 bonded laborers from 37,000 households were emancipated, according to the survey statistics from the Backward Society Education, a non-governmental organization working to eradicate the practice. But with the government ban focusing largely on men working in the farms, girls working as child slaves for their landlords were mostly overlooked, said Man Bahadur Chhetri from the Kamlari Abolition Project, a part of the U.S.-based non-profit Nepal Youth Foundation. According to Chhetri, some 12,000 kamlaris have since been rescued. However, he said, more than 500 girls, especially in Kailai and Kanchanpur districts in far-western Nepal, are still working as child domestic workers. A family tradition Shanta was among those rescued following the 2006 decision by Nepal's Supreme Court to make the kamlari practice illegal. "I was born into a family of bonded laborers," said Shanta, now an activist and former Constitutional Assembly member in Nepal's interim parliament. "I was expected and forced to work since I was eight." For the next 18 years, Shanta said she toiled under harsh circumstances as a domestic worker, serving her landlord in Dang in mid-west Nepal. She was freed when she was 26. Now 32, she has taught herself to read and write, entered politics and successfully contested the 2008 general election. Despite government efforts, Shanta thinks while poverty continues to exist in Nepal, so will child labor. "It might be minimized but not completely eradicated," she said. According to the United Nations Development Program's International Human Development Indicator, 44.2% of Nepal's population lives under the poverty line. In extreme cases, some parents send children to work. Sometimes, children themselves run away in search of a better life. While many Nepalese children are still trapped in this abysmal situation, the ones rescued share optimism for a better future -- their traumatic past has not killed these children's dreams. "I want to study and become a counselor so I can help children like myself when I grow up," Maya said. Yangzee, on the other hand, said she wants to continue the alpine legacy of her community. "I'm going to climb a mountain someday," she said. "It'll be Everest."
R. Sargent Shriver, who was responsible for launching the U.S. Peace Corps after marrying into the Kennedy family and joining John F. Kennedy's White House, has died, according to his family. Shriver, whose full name was Robert Sargent Shriver Jr., was 95. He had suffered for years from Alzheimer's disease. The family released a statement, saying Shriver died Tuesday "surrounded by his five children, five children in-law, and his 19 grandchildren." "He lived to make the world a more joyful, faithful, and compassionate place," the family's statement said. "He worked on stages both large and small but in the end, he will be best known for his love of others. No one ever came into his presence without feeling his passion and his enthusiasm for them." President Barack Obama said he was "deeply saddened" over the death of Shriver, whom he called "one of the brightest lights of the greatest generation." "Of his many enduring contributions, he will perhaps best be remembered as the founding director of the Peace Corps, helping make it possible for generations of Americans to serve as ambassadors of goodwill abroad," Obama said. "His loss will be felt in all of the communities around the world that have been touched by Peace Corps volunteers over the past half century and all of the lives that have been made better by his efforts to address inequality and injustice here at home." After overseeing the Peace Corps launch in the early 1960s, Shriver went on to serve subsequent presidential administrations and kept up his activism throughout his life, becoming a chief architect of President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty and later heading the Special Olympics, which was founded by his wife, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Shriver's entree into the Kennedy family was Joseph P. Kennedy, the family patriarch, who hired him to run a business venture in Chicago. According to the Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, the work led to an introduction to Eunice Kennedy, whose siblings included JFK, Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy. Shriver and Eunice Kennedy married in 1953. Shriver served as JFK's Midwest campaign manager for his 1960 presidential bid before heading the Peace Corps' launch, which was seen as part of a new approach to the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. "He told me that everyone in Washington seemed to think that the Peace Corps was going to be the biggest fiasco in history," Shriver told Time magazine in 1963 of Kennedy's request that he head the program, "and it would be much easier to fire a relative than a friend." In 2011, the Peace Corps is celebrating its 50th anniversary. More than 200,000 volunteers have served in 139 counties on issues ranging from education to public health to environmental preservation through the program, according to the Peace Corps' website. The Peace Corps Tuesday mourned the loss "of our founder, friend and guiding light." The Special Olympics, in a statement, said Shriver was an "advocate for the poor and powerless, and he compiled an unparalleled record of public service at every tier, from the local level to the world community." After John F. Kennedy, his brother-in-law, was assassinated in 1963, Shriver was tapped by Johnson to launch the White House Office of Economic Opportunity, which comprised a handful of anti-poverty programs. In a series of maneuvers that spoke to Shriver's penchant for working across the political aisle, he served as Republican President Richard Nixon's ambassador to France before becoming Democrat George McGovern's running mate in 1972, as the two unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nixon. McGovern named Shriver as his running mate after his first choice, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, stepped down after revealing he'd had psychiatric treatment that included electroshock therapy. In the 1980s and 1990s, Shriver served as chairman of the board of Special Olympics International, which Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded in 1968. The organization sponsors sports training and events around the world for people with intellectual disabilities. Shriver, who was born in Westminster, Maryland, in 1915 and who graduated from Yale, also was long active in the Roman Catholic Church. President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994. "We are greatly saddened by the passing of Sargent Shriver. He leaves behind an astonishing legacy of people helped, lives transformed, and communities improved," the former president and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in a statement.  "Through his work and his passion, he helped build a better America and a more humane world. And he did it with boundless enthusiasm, infectious joy, and the deepest love for his family, his nation, and his work." Eunice Kennedy Shriver died in 2009. The Shrivers had five children including Maria Shriver, the media personality and former first lady of California; and Timothy P. Shriver, who now heads Special Olympics International. Maria Shriver's husband, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said his father-in-law's life "is a blueprint for those of us who aspire to place the needs of others above our own." CNN's Ed Henry contributed to this report.
A sudden tragedy brings out the best in the media: journalists racing to the scene, ferreting out the details, leading the nation through its grief. It also brings out the worst. In the fragmentary accounts that followed Friday's horrifying massacre at a Connecticut school, some news organizations, following in the tracks of social media, managed to identify the wrong man as the shooter. And then television provided a platform for the instantaneous finger-pointing and point-scoring that all too often follows such shootings. I am conflicted when I watch the instant network specials, led by top anchors and featuring theme music and fancy logos, as I did after Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Tucson, after Aurora. Of course they want to devote time and resources to a major national story. But it also feels at times like a branding exercise, an effort to grab ratings share after a heartbreaking event. I am conflicted as well at watching some journalists interview children who saw the carnage. I understand their value as eyewitnesses, but these are young kids who had just been through a terrible trauma. To me, at least, it feels exploitative. Some organizations, including CNN, require the parents' permission, but it is not clear that all outlets followed such a policy in the scramble that followed the shootings. I was not conflicted at all when I read that a Hartford Courant reporter called the shooter's grandmother in Florida. "I just don't know, and I can't make a comment right now," Dorothy Hanson, 78, said in a shaky voice as she started to cry. I fail to see what that added to our understanding of the tragedy. Watch: Jon Stewart, media critic, takes on Fox The worst offense, though, was the headlong rush to identify the shooter as Ryan Lanza, 24, and blast his Facebook profile picture around cyberspace. CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, CBS, Slate, the Huffington Post and others named Ryan Lanza as the suspect, some of them based on guidance from law enforcement sources. In this wired age, his name was bandied about on Twitter and in other social media forums. The news outlets had to correct their reports when it turned out that the shooter was 20-year-old Adam Lanza, his brother, who first killed their mother. But they had suggested that an innocent man was responsible for murdering 27 people, including 20 children. What's more, most reports erroneously said Lanza's mother taught at the Newtown elementary school (a mistake I initially repeated as well). Watch: From Joe Scarborough to Rush Limbaugh, the conservative media meltdown Blogger Jeff Jarvis, who teaches journalism at the City University of New York, expressed regret for retweeting information about Ryan Lanza, although Jarvis did not use his name: "I did not say this was the 'alleged' or 'reputed' account of the person named as the killer. These are basic, basic journalistic skills drilled until they are reflexes and I would use them in any story for print. I didn't use them online." Not everyone was as candid in confessing their mistakes. The rush to judgment is hardly an isolated incident. After an Arizona gunman last year killed six people and wounded Gabby Giffords, some news organizations erroneously reported that the congresswoman was dead. After the Aurora shooting this past summer in a theater showing a Batman movie, ABC's Brian Ross told viewers the suspect was linked to the Colorado tea party before apologizing for reporting on someone with the same name. Watch: Is 'Zero Dark Thirty' tortured history or propaganda? After Friday's violence, there was an instinct by some in the media to pound away at their favorite positions. Mike Huckabee said on Fox News: "We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we've systematically removed God from our schools." I respect the former Arkansas governor, but Friday did not seem like the time for such a statement. At the same time, Rush Limbaugh ripped MSNBC's Alex Wagner and CNN's Piers Morgan for saying the massacre pointed up the need for stricter gun control. "You've got a horrible event here, and they're already looking to politicize it. ... These people look at stuff like this as an opportunity to advance their agenda or blame conservatives." (The three guns, including an assault rifle, used by Adam Lanza were legally registered to his mother.) All this is reminiscent of what happened to NBC's Bob Costas when he used a halftime commentary to question the gun culture in this country after an NFL player was involved in a murder-suicide. Costas was attacked from the right for daring to inject a serious issue into a sporting event. Watch: The media fixate on Hillary and 2016, again Except in the days following a mass shooting, the media seem to shy away from a serious debate over gun control, perhaps fearing that it is too divisive and will alienate a broad swath of readers and viewers. The mainstream press operates under the assumption that Congress will never pass a gun-control measure because of the NRA's clout and therefore the matter isn't much worth pursuing. The issue was barely mentioned in the presidential campaign, and journalists made no attempt to force it onto the national agenda. The same thing will happen after Newtown inevitably fades from the newscasts and the front pages, and the gun question disappears until the next big tragedy forces us to revisit it once again.

Outdoor dining, fresh ingredients and local festivals make summer the perfect season for food lovers to explore the world. Check out these 10 destinations for fresh summer eats. See more top summer food destinations Istria, Croatia In Istria, Croatia's northern peninsula, the land is bursting with all things green. Vineyards flank winding roads. Trees, heavy with figs and peaches, hang over garden gates. Croatia's 1,390-square-mile northern peninsula is known for its freshly caught seafood, terraced olive groves, hilltop vineyards and truffles. Head to 120-year-old Kabola, Istria's first green-certified winery, to taste wines that have been partly aged in amphoras, or clay vessels. The family vintners are especially passionate about regional Malvazija grapes; if you like red, don't miss the peppery 2009 Teran. Afterward, drive 15 minutes south to dine on cuttlefish in its own ink topped with silky puréed potatoes and a generous portion of black truffle shavings at San Rocco Hotel's restaurant. Beyond Croatia, summer's food groups are as distinctive as countries themselves. 10 surprising facts about turbulence Northern Italy The weather in northern Italy might be similar to neighboring Croatia, for example, but altitude and Austrian influences in the Dolomites means regional specialties include pork sausages and apple strudel. Regional specialties such as speck (smoked ham), cajinci (a ravioli with ricotta and spinach), and wild berries pair well with hikes and overnights in rifugios, or mountain huts, in this northern corner of Italy. Head there with Whole Foods' new tour company, Whole Journeys, at the end of August. The seven-day itinerary includes a hands-on cooking lesson—Alto Adige gnocchi is one menu highlight—a private dinner in a century-old vineyard, and yogurt-making classes on a dairy farm. Turks and Caicos Whether you resort hop or hit local hotspots on the Turks and Caicos Islands, be sure to pair a cool Turks head beer with conch, a Caribbean specialty. You'll find the sweet shell meat fried, stewed and served ceviche style at weekly Island Fish Fries, where travelers and island residents mingle on the beach and local "rake and scrape" bands bang out tunes. Or head to haute restaurants such as Parallel23 at the Regent Palms Hotel, where new chef Ingo Möller serves up flaky sea bass and fresh crab rolls; meals end with dessert and cocktails on a moonlit beach. August also means lobster season on the islands, something Grace Bay Club's Anacaona restaurant celebrates with a decadent lobster tasting menu. America's best urban running trails Portland, Oregon Progressive culinary scenes in cities like Portland, Oregon, mean farmers and chefs have close relationships, so seasonal summer ingredients such as heirloom tomatoes, hazelnuts and sorrel don't travel far before landing on your plate at locally loved restaurants like Castagna. You could also sign up for a farm dinner or trip with Farm to Fork, a food, wine and agritourism event company that creates culinary experiences that directly link consumers with craft winemakers, food artisans and family farmers throughout the state. On a four-day canoeing trip down the Rogue River, for example, participants take cooking classes and stop by vineyards and leafy orchards. Montreal, Canada It's no wonder that Montreal earns frequent comparisons to Paris: The city's culinary culture—influenced by 80 rich ethnicities and a genuine focus on local—is a favorite among foodies, especially during warmer summer months. Neighborhoods are dotted with patisseries and boulangeries and the city's restaurant scene—there are more than 5,500 to choose from—has standout options such as the hip La Salle á Manger, where spicy fried rabbit and halibut ceviche make the menu and Nora Gray, where chef Emma Cardarelli turns out rich venison tartare and house-made pasta. Madrid, Spain Global capitals also vie for attention. "Madrid is the place—do not hesitate!" says Virginia Irurita of Made for Spain tour company, based in the Spanish capital. Her enthusiasm isn't just rooted in particular chefs and dishes, but also in Spain's summer food traditions: Café tables spread out along sidewalks and in park squares, and boisterous crowds sip Tinto de verano, a refreshing wine spritzer, until late at night. World's best airport spas Cape Town, South Africa While Cape Town is not at its weather peak in June through August, popular restaurants stay packed with travelers looking to bookend a South African safari with an urban jaunt. Among the culture capital's latest offerings, chef Bruce Robertson, formerly of Cape Grace and the Showroom Restaurant in Cape Town, now hosts bespoke dining experiences—a five-course, seafood-focused menu paired with South African wines—at the intimate Boat House in Scarborough just outside of the city. Colorado Dining also heads outdoors in Colorado, where crisp, dry air and 75-degree days invite foraging excursions and food festivals. Here, cozy lodges' winter comfort foods and après-ski hot toddies have given way to farmers' markets and restaurants with sprawling terraces. Brooklyn, New York Restaurant access alone is what defines summer dining to many New Yorkers. In Brooklyn, where up-and-coming restaurants are overrun by travelers in fall and spring months, hotter temps mean saying goodbye to tourists and finally getting seated at popular restaurants such as Battersby and Runner & Stone. Dubai No matter what the season, you might still get denied entry to Dubai restaurants such as At.mosphere, the world's tallest at 1,350 feet, where doormen ask for a reservation code. With a $122 per person minimum, rejection might be a blessing in sleek disguise—and there are plenty of other posh options to choose from in the Middle Eastern culture capital.

A Marine who defied orders and braved a blizzard of enemy fire to recover wounded and dead fellow American and Afghan troops during a six-hour firefight in Afghanistan received the Medal of Honor Thursday from President Barack Obama. "I know that you've grappled with the grief of that day, that you have said that your efforts were somehow a failure because your teammates didn't come home," Obama told Dakota Meyer, who became the first living Marine to be recognized with the nation's highest military honor for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. "But, as your commander-in-chief, I want you to know it's quite the opposite. You did your duty above and beyond, and you kept the faith with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps that you love." "The award honors the men who gave their lives that day, and the men who were in that fight," Meyer said, according to a Marine newsletter. "I didn't do anything more than any other Marine would. I was put in an extraordinary circumstance, and I just did my job." The incident began before dawn on September 8, 2009, as a patrol made up of Afghan forces and their American trainers were making their way on foot up a narrow valley in Kunar province to meet with elders in a village. Meyer was about a mile away when Taliban fighters ambushed the patrol, firing from three sides, Obama said. Meyer and Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez could hear the ambush over the radio as the Taliban fighters unleashed a firestorm from nearby hills, Obama said. Soon a number of men were killed and several Afghans and Americans were pinned down, including four members of Meyer's team, Obama said. "Four times, Dakota and Juan asked permission to go in; four times they were denied," Obama said. "It was, they were told, too dangerous." But Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez left their relatively safe location and jumped into a Humvee, with Meyer manning a gun in the turret, his body and head fully exposed to a rain of fire from AK-47s, machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, Obama said. As they reached wounded Afghan soldiers, Meyer jumped out and loaded them into the Humvee, then drove them back to safety, Obama said. "Those who were there called it the most intense combat they had ever seen," the president said. For a second time, the men drove back into the hail of fire to pick up more wounded Afghans; when one gun jammed, Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez switched to another vehicle, Obama said. On their third trip, they found a group of wounded Americans "desperately trying to escape the bullets," Obama said. "Juan wedged the Humvee right into the line of fire, using the vehicle as a shield. With Dakota on the guns, they helped those Americans back to safety as well. "Dakota later confessed, 'I didn't think I was going to die; I knew I was,'" Obama said. "Still, they pushed on." They made a fourth trip, and then a fifth. On the fifth trip -- now accompanied by others -- they reached the bodies of the four members of Meyer's team. "Dakota jumped out and ran toward them, drawing all those enemy guns on himself, bullets kicking up the dirt all around him," Obama said. "Dakota and the others who had joined him knelt down, picked up their comrades and, through all those bullets, all the smoke and all the chaos, carried them out, one by one." Meyer agreed to accept the medal in their names: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, Petty Officer Third Class James Layton and Gunnery Sgt. Edwin Johnson. "I was a failure," Meyer told CNN last fall. "My guys died. That was my whole team." Neither Obama nor the Marines saw it that way. A defense official with knowledge of the award process last fall said that just before he retired, the U.S. Marine commandant, Gen. James Conway, recommended Meyer for the nation's highest award for bravery. The actions of Meyer, 23, saved the lives of 13 U.S. Marines and soldiers and 23 Afghan soldiers, according to the Marines' Medal of Honor account. He also is credited with killing at least eight Taliban insurgents during the incident. For his role in the battle, Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez received the Navy Cross, the second-highest decoration that may be bestowed on Marines. Meyer, who serves in the Inactive Ready Reserve of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve as a sergeant in his home state of Kentucky, said in November that he didn't want to discuss details of the incident because it was still difficult to think about. On Wednesday, Obama and Meyer had a beer together on the patio outside the Oval Office. According to a series of tweets by White House spokesman Jay Carney, when a member of Obama's staff called Meyer over the weekend to prepare, "Meyer made a special request. ... Meyer asked the staffer if he could have a beer with the president." Meyer is only the second Marine to earn the Medal of Honor from the current wars. In April 2004, Marine Cpl. Jason Dunham was leading a patrol in an Iraqi town near the Syrian border when a person in a vehicle dropped a grenade. Dunham hurled himself on top it, using his helmet to try to blunt the force of the blast. He died eight days later and received the honor posthumously.

British guitarist Eric Clapton added a few million pounds to his fortune Friday, when a painting out of his private collection garnered a record sum at auction in London. "Abstraktes Bild (809-4)" by German painter Gerhard Richter sold for more than $34 million, the highest price ever for work by a living artist, Sotheby's said. The record sum ballooned the monetary value of the painting by over tenfold from its previous auction price in 2001, when it sold within a group of three paintings from the 809 series that together fetched a total of $3,415,750. In a five-minute bidding battle, an unnamed caller beat out two competitors, who also phoned in their offers, to take Richter's work, which translates into English as "Abstract Picture (809-4)", for up to double the sum the auction house estimated it would take. Clapton memorabilia auction nets $1.77 million Sotheby's originally placed the current value of the 1994 oil on canvas work at anywhere between $14 and $19 million, well below the final record bid of $34,190,756. The old record for a work by a living artist was set in May 2010, when American artist Jasper John's painting "Flag," a depiction of the Stars and Stripes, sold for $28,642,500 at Christie's in New York, the auction house said. The record-breaking painting is one in a sequence of four. Another from Richter's 809 series, "Abstraktes Bild (809-2)" fetched $3,119,403 at the same auction on Friday, Sotheby's said. Two additional artists achieved career record sums for their works at the auction, though nowhere near the mammoth figure Richter's 809-4 took. A painting titled "MLR" by German artist Isa Genzken went for $425,355 and "Endless Knott" by Tibetan artist Gonkar Gyatso pulled down $271,409. Richter, who is 80, is famous for dreamlike photo realistic paintings but also for colorful abstract works. He created his 809 series by painting abstract images with mainly primary colors then scraping over them with a squeegee-like object. Richter has compared art to "the religious search for God," in a collection of his quotes published on his website. Richter holds all artists in the highest religious esteem: "Now there are no priests or philosophers left, artists are the most important people in the world," according to a quote on his website from 1966. As to who may be the most important living artist - at least now the money is on Richter.
Thousands of travelers are facing long delays and cancellations as a strike by French air traffic controllers intensifies, wreaking havoc with flight schedules across Europe. On Wednesday, the second day of the industrial action over aviation cuts, the situation was "unstable," according to European air safety body Eurocontrol. Leading European carriers including British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have all reported flight cancellations and delays. Eurocontrol earlier said the strike was expected to cause up to 14,000 hours of delays. Ryanair said in a statement it expected to cancel 15% of its 1,600 scheduled flights on Wednesday and warned the situation was likely to deteriorate further. "We expect that these delays will continue to build through the morning as the backlog of delayed flights rises,"it said. "Ryanair apologizes sincerely for any delays or inconvenience caused to our customers by this unnecessary and regrettable French ATC strike." The budget airline earlier accused air traffic controllers of "blackmailing" passengers and urged European Union officials to ban them from taking industrial action. Also Wednesday, Brussels Airport said all flights were cancelled from 6 p.m. local time after some Belgian air traffic controllers voted to stage a walkout. Many passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the disruption. "Can't sleep Too busy worrying about the controllers strike. Would prefer not to spend my holiday in the Airport," wrote one user, mafleen. Airlines were advising all passengers traveling to and from European airports to check the status of their flight before departing. Under EU law, those experiencing cancellations should be entitled to a refund or alternative booking.
Americans back Barack Obama's plan to move U.S. troops from Iraq to Afghanistan, a new national poll indicates. U.S. soldiers gather at the "Cross Swords" in Baghdad's secure Green Zone earlier this year. Fifty-five percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Thursday back the president-elect when it comes to reducing the number of American combat troops in Iraq and increasing the number in Afghanistan. "The reason is simple," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "The war in Iraq is very unpopular, while a majority support the war in Afghanistan." Sixty-three percent of those polled oppose the war in Iraq, with 36 percent "favor" it. Fifty-two percent "favor" the war in Afghanistan, with 46 percent in opposition. "In addition, roughly half the public thinks that the U.S. is winning in Iraq, but six in 10 say that America's losing in Afghanistan," adds Holland. That forty-nine percent who now say the U.S. is winning the war in Iraq (with an equal amount saying the U.S. is not winning) is up from 32 percent last year. "To the American public, Afghanistan is the good war, and it's going badly. Iraq is the bad war, and it's going fairly well," CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. The poll suggests that Americans believe that the president-elect will remove all combat troops from Iraq. Obama told reporters Monday in Chicago that he still thinks 16 months is the "right time frame" for removing U.S. combat troops from the country. Sixty-three percent of those questioned in the survey are confident that Obama will do just that, with 36 percent not confident. A vast majority of Americans, 79 percent, also appear to be confident that Obama will improve foreign relations, with 74 percent confident he'll improve economic conditions and 68 percent optimistic about Obama keeping the country safe from terrorism. "In the wake of the recent attacks in Mumbai, India, concerns about terrorism here in the U.S. have grown a bit, but most Americans don't think a terrorist attack is likely in the next few weeks," said Holland. In fact, the 36 percent who say acts of terrorism are likely in the U.S. over the next several weeks is up only slightly from the 30 percent who felt the same way in September, the last time the question was asked. "The dispute between India and Pakistan may be the next big flash point in world affairs, but Americans want this country to stay out of it," Holland added. Eight in 10 think the U.S. should side with neither country, with 15 percent saying side with India and one percent wanting to side with Pakistan. And in a sign that Obama is enjoying a honeymoon with Americans right now, 64 percent of those polled approve of how he handled the terrorist attack in India. That's 15 points higher than President Bush scored in the survey, even though Obama made clear during the crisis that there can be only one American president at a time and that he was deferring to Bush when it came to any American response. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted Monday and Tuesday, with 1,096 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Rafael Nadal beat Novak Djokovic in a one-sided Monte Carlo Masters final Sunday to claim his eighth straight title in the principality. Nadal brushed aside the world number one 6-3 6-1 in just 78 minutes to end a run of seven straight defeats in finals to the Serbian, including this year's six-hour epic at the Australian Open. "I've always felt unbelievable here," a visibly emotional Nadal said after his emphatic victory. "It's unbelievable to win this historic tournament eight times. I always feel great when I come here. "I had lost to Novak seven times, so losing eight would not have been much different. But to win this one makes a big difference." Nadal has made the title his own at the distinctive clay court tournament overlooking the Mediterranean and was clinching his 20th in a Masters 1000 tournament, the first man to reach that landmark. But he had not won on the ATP Tour since claiming the French Open at Roland Garros last June as Djokovic has dominated. Djokovic, who was playing this week after learning of the death of his grandfather in Serbia, took the first game to love but struggled to maintain that level. "I'm sorry for my performance today, Rafa played well and deserved to win today," said Djokovic. "I'm still very happy to reach the finals for the second time," he added, referring to his 2009 loss to Nadal in Monte Carlo. Nadal will now go to defend his Barcelona title next week as he builds up to the second grand slam of the season in Paris on his favorite clay surface. In other tennis action Sunday, Fed Cup holders the Czech Republic beat Italy 4-1 in Ostrava to seal their place in the final. Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova gave the Czechs an unbeatable 3-0 lead after seeing off Francesca Schiavone 6-4 7-6 in the first rubber of the day. The Czechs will host Serbia, who beat Russia 3-2 in Moscow, in the final.
In the world of diving, this is as good as it gets. Standing on a platform some 27 meters high with Bilbao's Nervion River flowing underneath, the view from La Salve Bridge is something to behold. The spectacular Guggenheim Museum provides a breathtaking backdrop for those brave enough to leap into the water from a platform three times higher than those used at the Olympic Games. The Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series brings together some of the best in the business and the 52,000 which flocked to see the likes of Russia's Artem Silchenko and overall champion, Gary Hunt, were not to be disappointed. The 14 men from across the world produced a number of breathtaking dives, hitting the water at 85 kilometers an hour during the event which has been held every year since 2009. While Silchenko won the Bilbao event, Hunt finished second as the Briton secured his fourth world title in five years.
I'm no stranger to poverty. I've lived it. I don't forget it. And when I saw Katherine M. pick up aluminum cans while walking her granddaughter home from school, I couldn't stop the rush of emotions. I wasn't reporting from a developing country. This was a New York street in the heart of Harlem. "If I don't have my gloves, I don't dig into the garbage," Katherine said as she walked past dozens of black plastic trash bags that lined the street. I met her at a soup kitchen while covering a story about the end of the food stamp benefit boost from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. "You've gotta do your homework, and I've gotta do your hair," Katherine said with a smile to her 9-year-old granddaughter, Katherine. In 2004, her daughter died in childbirth, making the now-66-year-old a caretaker of three overnight. That's when she went back to changing diapers and taking care of two young boys with small attention spans and big appetites. Raising children on a fixed income was not easy for Katherine. Receiving $358 a month in food stamps helped but didn't cover all her grocery needs. On November 1, her food stamp benefits shrunk. That's when the boost in benefits from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ended. About 47 million Americans saw their benefits reduced, too. For Katherine, less food stamp benefits meant collecting more cans on the street and from friends. "I tell everybody here, 'give me your cans,' " she said. She redeems the cans for 5 cents each. Talking to strangers like me about her economic situation was not easy. "I don't like that word, 'poor,' " she said. "I'm bent." "What does bent mean?" I asked. "Poor, but I don't like the word poor," she said. After Katherine's story aired, a generous viewer from Florida helped her shop for groceries so that this Thanksgiving, she doesn't have to sell cans to put food on the table. Life has been rough on Katherine, but you'd never know from the constant smile on her face. She laughs about the small joys in life and about its tough lessons, as well. "Here, you pick that up for me," Katherine instructed her young granddaughter, pointing to a bottle resting against a fence. Young Katherine used her small hands to pick up the bottle and give it to Grandma, who put it in a small black plastic bag. We all continued walking. As I observed and listened, I could feel a knot growing in my throat. "I don't want her to feel ashamed because she have to pick up cans to eat or get the things that she needs," Katherine said as she looked in every direction for plastic or aluminum. "No matter how people look at you, you keep your head up." "Do you think it's an important lesson?" I asked. "Yeah, it shows young kids how to be independent," she responded. By this time, I was holding back my tears. It was a lesson I learned too, at a very early age. And I was seeing another young girl receive the same advice. According to Feeding America, 15.9 million American children lived in food-insecure homes in 2012. While many American children are thinking about the latest version of their favorite smartphone or tablet this season, millions of children across the country, like little Katherine, don't know where their next meal will come from.

Doctors and hospital officials from Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, are notifying 18 neurosurgery patients that they might have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a serious and incurable neurological disorder. "Today we are reaching out to 18 neurosurgery patients who were exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease over the last three weeks at Forsyth Medical Center," said Jeff Lindsay, president of the center, according to CNN affiliate WGHP. The hospital is in the process of contacting the 18 people, spokeswoman Jeanne Mayer said Tuesday. She was not sure how many had been reached. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, CJD affects about one person in every 1 million people per year worldwide. "It is important to note that there are multiple variations of CJD and this case is not related to mad cow disease," Novant Health said in a statement. The hospital confirmed that on January 18, an operation was performed on a patient with CJD symptoms who later tested positive for the illness. Even though the surgical instruments were sterilized by standard hospital procedures, they should have gone through enhanced sterilization procedures used when there are confirmed or suspected cases of CJD. The original patient "had neurological symptoms that could have been attributed to CJD or another brain disease," Novant Health said. "There were reasons to suspect that this patient might have had CJD. As such, the extra precautions should have been taken, but were not." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the World Health Organization, recommends that surgical equipment used on CJD patients be destroyed or decontaminated through an intense disinfecting process. Although CJD can be transferred through surgical equipment, hospital officials say the likelihood of these patients contracting the disease is very low. The CDC corroborates that assessment. It says that no cases of the disease have been linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment since 1976. But Lindsay made no excuses. "On behalf of the entire team at Novant Health, I apologize to the patients and their families, for having caused this anxiety." CJD is a rare, degenerative and fatal brain disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health. It's characterized by rapid, progressive dementia. Initial symptoms can include problems with muscular coordination, personality changes including impaired memory and thinking; and impaired vision. CJD is believed to be caused by a type of protein called a prion. It can be sporadic, hereditary or acquired; the acquired type is the rarest form, according to the NIH, and seen in fewer than 1% of cases. It is not contagious through casual contact. Asked whether the 18 people would be tested, Mayer said there is no quick test for CJD. The original patient underwent brain surgery and then the disease was found through a number of tests afterward, she said. In some cases, CJD can take years to show up, Mayer said. The hospital has instituted the enhanced sterilization process on all surgical instruments used in brain surgery, Novant Health said. In September, 13 patients received similar warnings from two hospitals in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, when a patient who had undergone neurosurgery was later suspected to have CJD. The hospitals shared the specialized surgical equipment that was used to operate on the patient and continued to use it until the suspicion of exposure to the disease surfaced.

The crew of the International Space Station marked the 10th anniversary of continuous human occupation of the orbiting science laboratory with a typical workday, pausing only briefly for a chat with NASA chief Charles Bolden and questions from international reporters. "It's kind of mind-boggling when you stop and think about what you've done," Bolden told the crew. Bolden is a former NASA astronaut who flew on four space shuttle missions prior to the station's 2000 opening. The football-field sized platform passed the 10-year mark early Tuesday, some 57,361 orbits of Earth after the first crew came aboard, according to NASA. On October 25, the station eclipsed the previous record for constant human living in space, passing the Russian space station Mir. Since the first module, the Russian-built Zarya, launched on November 20, 1998, 103 vehicles have traveled to the station, bringing 196 people to visit or live long-term and conduct science experiments and other work, according to NASA. The station has traveled more than 1.5 billion miles -- the equivalent of eight round trips to the Sun. Human habitation of the station began in 2000. Bolden said the international flavor of the station's construction, supply system and staffing do more to prove that humans can get along than many earthbound diplomats, Bolden told the astronauts. "You're part of an amazing legacy there on the station," he said. People need look no further than the anniversary to recognize the station's most remarkable accomplishment, said astronaut Shannon Walker. "Ten years of constant habitation in space is an amazing achievement in and of itself," she said. But the station has also produced advances in science, medicine and environmental technology that are helping change life on Earth, according to NASA. The agency says more than 600 science experiments have been conducted aboard the station, with results helping produce new strategies to deliver cancer drugs, advances in vaccine development and a possible treatment for a form of muscular dystrophy, among other things. The commemoration of the anniversary was clouded by the station's uncertain future. While the 15 nations involved in the space station program have agreed in principal to continue operating it for another decade, the United States is scheduled to retire its space shuttle fleet after two more flights -- cutting off a main supply route to get materials to the station. While Russian spacecraft and commercial providers are expected to take up some of the slack and help keep the station operating for another 10 years, station crew members acknowledged that the shuttle's retirement will make the station's mission more challenging. "I think it's not a real problem to supply the station with consumables and some other items, but I think it's a real problem to deliver the results," Russian cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri said during a news conference with reporters. "Now we can deliver only digital data, but sometimes it's necessary to bring back some physical items."
Argentina will be missing striker Diego Milito for the final two World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Uruguay as Diego Maradona's struggling team battle to reach the finals in 2010. Diego Milito has had only a bit-part role for Argentina despite his good form for Inter Milan. Milito is expected to be sidelined for the next month after injuring his thigh while playing for Italian champions Inter Milan on Saturday. The 30-year-old was replaced by Mario Balotelli 25 minutes into the 2-1 victory against Udinese at the San Siro, and scans have shown that he suffered a first-degree strain in his right thigh. The Albiceleste go into Saturday's home clash with Peru on a run of four defeats in the last five games which has left the team outside the top-four automatic qualifying spots. While bottom side Peru have no chance of qualifying, Wednesday's opponents Uruguay lie just a point behind Argentina in sixth and will be hoping to at least clinch the play-off position in the South American zone. Milito has made a flying start to his career with Inter this season, scoring five goals in his first seven games, but he has had only a bit-part role in Argentina's qualifying campaign so far. Coach Maradona, who can call on the likes of Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Carlos Tevez and Ezequiel Lavezzi up front, has retained Boca Juniors striker Martin Palermo in his squad. Palermo scored both goals in the 2-0 friendly win over Ghana last week, and was also on target for his club at the weekend in a 3-2 victory against Velez Sarsfield. Enzo Perez is also added to the 26-man squad after making his debut against the Africans, along with Estudiantes teammate Juan Sebastian Veron and Velez Sarsfield defender Nicolas Otamendi. Colon goalkeeper Diego Pozo, Newell's Old Boys defender Rolando Schiavi, Boca duo Federico Insua and Luciano Fabian Monzon and Huracan midfielder Mario Bolatti are also included among the home-based players.
The head of Australian soccer has vowed "to throw the book" at the men charged with match-fixing in a lower league competition -- which has been described as the worst such scandal in the country's sporting history. Nine people were arrested on Sunday, and six of them were charged in court Monday, including the coach of Victorian Premier League team Southern Stars, a group of his players and a Malaysian national. Five of those involved were British players who had been reportedly been offered to the Melbourne-based club at the start of the season on a non-payment basis. The Australian Football Federation (FFA) website said the arrests were made after it received data on suspicious betting patterns involving the Southern Stars in August, which it passed on to Victorian state police. "Integrity measures put in place by football have been effective in detecting this activity," FFA chief David Gallop told reporters Sunday. "From the FFA's point of view we'll initiate proceedings under our own codes of conduct. You can be sure that we will throw the book at them. "That means life bans on a worldwide basis." Police said more than $2 million had been bet on the team, which is bottom of its division -- a second-tier competition below the national A-League. Gerry Gsubramanian, 45, is accused of being the contact man for overseas betting syndicates who organized with the players the outcomes of matches. "He receives phone calls. He is given advice on how the Southern Stars players are to perform," Detective acting senior sergeant Scott Poynder told the court, according to the Australian Associated Press. "Video showed some of the players were doing some unusually poor play. For that work he received payment. Some of the bets are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars." Gallop said he had been told by police it was considered an "isolated issue." "This highlights the fact that lower league games, which aren't under the scrutiny of things like a global television broadcast, are potentially more susceptible to this kind of activity," Gallop said. "At this stage the police have indicated to us that they are looking at an isolated issue in Victoria and we need to be guided by the police in that regard." The controversy adds to a difficult year for Australian sport, which has been rocked by the drug scandals involving leading Australian Football League team Essendon as well as the country's rugby league competition. "This was flagged earlier this year by the Australian Crime Commission that there were links with organized crime, trafficking of performance-enhancing drugs and match-fixing," journalist Jim Wilson of the Seven Network told CNN's World Sport. "People were saying there's no match-fixing in Australian sport, and then this comes to light. It's a lower grade competition ... but it's the exotic betting and the middle-men involved that really sends shockwaves through Australian sport. "Bets from India, Asia, Singapore, China on these local teams. I think you'll find that there are other sports that will be investigated and are under the spotlight as far as the Australian Federal Police is concerned. "I don't think it's just limited to football in this country. This is disturbing for Australian sport in general."
WikiLeaks said Thursday it has begun publishing some 2.4 million e-mails from Syrian politicians, government ministries and companies dating back to 2006. The e-mails, which are in a range of languages including Arabic and Russian, come from the ministries of presidential affairs, finance, information and foreign affairs, among others. According to WikiLeaks, the e-mails "shine a light on the inner workings of the Syrian government and economy, but they also reveal how the West and Western companies say one thing and do another." One e-mail shows an Italian company trying to get around U.S. sanctions on Syria and another indicates that the company was sending engineers and helicopter radio equipment to Syria as recently as February 2012. Syrian forces began their crackdown against protesters in March 2011 and that has sparked a grass-roots uprising and a bloody regime offensive against dissenters. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published about 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its founder, Julian Assange, was arrested in Britain in 2010 over allegations of rape and sex crime charges in Sweden. Two women have accused Assange of sexually assaulting them in August 2010 when he was visiting Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. Opinion: Australia to Assange's rescue? Don't hold your breath He has been arrested in absentia, Swedish prosecutors have said. Swedish authorities want to question him about the allegations, which he denies. Assange has been fighting extradition ever since, saying the allegations are retribution for his organization's disclosure of American secrets. His bail conditions included staying every night at the home of a supporter outside London. Assange applied for asylum to Ecuador on June 19 and has been inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since then. It is unclear when Ecuador will decide on the request. He sought refuge at the embassy five days after the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom dismissed a bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to Sweden -- his last option in British courts. A representative for the WikiLeaks founder said Assange will not honor a notice that British police served him requiring that he surrender to authorities. "This should not be considered any sign of disrespect," said Susan Benn of the Julian Assange Defense Fund, who read the statement. Benn said the United States has empaneled a grand jury in its goal to press charges against Assange. Turning himself in would have started a process that would have ended with Assange's extradition to the United States, she said. "It is clear that there is a plan to bring Julian Assange to the United States," she said. Citing what she called cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of the alleged source of leaked documents, Pfc. Bradley Manning, Benn said that sending Assange to the United States "would be a violation of his rights." Police said Assange has violated the terms of his bail by staying at the embassy, and that ignoring the notice to turn himself in is a further violation. See yourself as the next Assange? Good luck
Afghanistan and several African nations are the most at risk to have a food shortage, an organization that works with the United Nations said in a report Thursday. Afghanistan was named as the country with the most vulnerable food supply, according to the study by Maplecroft, a British-based research agency. After Afghanistan, African nations were on the rest of the top 10 list. In order, the next were the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Eritrea, Sudan, Ethiopia, Angola, Liberia, Chad and Zimbabwe. In all, African nations were 36 of the top 50 on the list. "Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to food insecurity because of the frequency of extreme weather events, high rates of poverty and failing infrastructures," the organization said. Maplecroft said it worked with the U.N.'s World Food Programme to develop the criteria to judge 163 countries. The group came up with 12 categories to help make evaluations. Those categories included the nutritional and health status of populations, cereal production and imports, Gross Domestic Product per capita, natural disasters, conflict and the effectiveness of government, the group said. The United States was ranked No. 158. Finland got the best rank and was considered least at risk.
At least 20 people were killed and more than 35 others wounded when a suicide car bomber followed by gunmen in police uniforms attacked the police headquarters in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Sunday, city police said. The Interior Ministry in Baghdad placed the casualty count higher: 30 dead and 70 wounded. In the immediate chaotic aftermath of the attack, exact figures were difficult to come by. Oil-rich Kirkuk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Baghdad, has been the scene of tensions recently. It is also one of the disputed areas in the country between the central government and Kurdistan regional government. The United States and the U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq condemned Sunday's attack. Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative for Iraq, said the bombers "show a complete disregard for human life." "It is important that the people of Kirkuk remain united against the forces of extremism and hatred," Kobler said in a statement issued by UNAMI. "I urge the Iraqi leadership to take all necessary steps that are required to deal with this alarming situation, particularly in Kirkuk, the symbol of peaceful coexistence in Iraq." A series of bombings in January killed dozens and left more than 100 wounded in Kirkuk. The attacks seemed targeted at Kurdish government officials. The Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan regional government have been at odds for years over who has final authority over Iraq's vast oil wealth. At the end of last year, relations between Prime Minister Nuri al-Malik's government and the Iraqi Kurds seemed to deteriorate further. In November, Iraqi Kurdistan deployed troops and tanks to cement the Kurds' claim over the strategic city. This launched a tense standoff with units of the Iraqi army, which had been deployed to areas near Kirkuk.
On shaky, grainy video recordings, a group of men show off a stash of pills, pop open Budweiser tall boys and shoot dice for stacks of cash. One injects what appears to be heroin; another displays a large-caliber pistol, ejecting four bullets from the chamber to show that it's loaded. Here's the punchline: These guys are already in jail. The scenes were captured in 2009 on a camera smuggled into the House of Detention in New Orleans, a decrepit lockup pressed back into service after Hurricane Katrina. The video's release during a federal court hearing this week sparked a new demand by the city's mayor for the federal government to take over the Orleans Parish prison system and a round of I-told-you-sos by advocates for the inmates held there. In addition to the displays of contraband, the inmates in the now-shuttered facility show themselves dishing out soup from bins in grungy, overcrowded cells and sleeping on mattresses laid on floors. One holds up glue traps he says are used to catch nutria, a rat-like pest that has infested much of southern Louisiana and notes that the jail was supposed to have been closed. "Why're we in here, then?" he asks. "ACLU investigated, and they told them it's closed down ... why're we in here?" This week's hearings in U.S. District Court are part of a lawsuit filed against Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman. Attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center say Gusman's neglect led to "brutal and inhumane conditions" for inmates, many of whom are jailed for non-violent misdemeanor offenses. "Hearing some of the testimony and looking at some of the video of the jail itself, I cannot imagine the conditions of any human being living in those conditions," James Hitzman, the father of an inmate who killed himself in the prison two years ago, told CNN affilliate WVUE. In a statement issued Tuesday, Gusman said he closed the House of Detention in 2012 because of its "state of disrepair and abhorrent lack of proper security measures." "Following Hurricane Katrina, we were forced to reopen the House of Detention to house inmates, because other inmate facilities were destroyed by the floods. It was never meant to be a long-term solution," Gusman said. "In addition, we have been using eight temporary tents to house inmates. These facilities were never meant to be used this long for these purposes." U.S. District Judge Lance Africk is weighing whether to approve a settlement with the sheriff's office that would require the parish to provide appropriate housing, protection and medical care for inmates. But New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu called for a federal receiver to be put in control of the jail after the release of the video, which he said was turned up by the city's lawyers. "It is now clearer than ever that the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office is not keeping the prison secure and our city safe," Landrieu said in a statement. "The people of the city are investing over $226 million to build new prison facilities and over $30 million each year in the taxpayer money to operate the jail. I cannot in good conscience cut vital services or raise taxes to put even more money into an office where waste, fraud, and abuse run rampant." CNN's Karan Olson and Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.
if inclusive and limited in scope -- to be permissible. The U.S. Congress regularly opens its sessions with a prayer. Friday's invocation by House Chaplain the Rev. Patrick Conroy began: "Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Help us this day to draw closer to You so that, with Your Spirit and aware of Your presence among us, we may all face the tasks of this day." Forty-nine members of Congress, mostly Republicans, along with 18 state attorneys general have filed supporting legal briefs backing the city. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a "legal ministry" based in Scottsdale, Arizona, filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Greece Town Board, saying the Supreme Court has upheld the practice of government bodies "to acknowledge America's religious heritage and invoke divine guidance and blessings upon their work." "A few people should not be able to extinguish the traditions of our nation merely because they heard something they didn't like," said Brett Harvey, an attorney for the group. "Because the authors of the Constitution invoked God's blessing on public proceedings, this tradition shouldn't suddenly be deemed unconstitutional." But the 2nd Circuit appeals court concluded Greece officials were not diligent enough in efforts to find a more diverse set of voices from other faiths to open the public sessions, suggesting "a single religious sect" was being advanced. The high court is now being asked to offer more firm guidelines over when and if such public prayers are constitutionally acceptable. The case is Town of Greece, N.Y. v. Galloway (12-696).

The family of a man trampled to death in a New York Wal-Mart on Friday filed a lawsuit Wednesday, claiming the store failed to control the crowd pushing to gain entry on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. A temporary worker at this Wal-Mart was crushed to death when shoppers rushed into the store last week. Jdimytai Damour, 34, a temporary worker, was crushed as he and other employees tried to unlock the doors of the Wal-Mart at Green Acres Mall. The wrongful-death lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court by the family's attorney, Jordan Hecht, names Wal-Mart and the mall's owner, manager and security firm as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that Damour's death was caused by the "wanton disregard for public safety and gross negligence of the defendants." Hecht also filed a notice of claim against Nassau County to preserve the family's right to file a lawsuit against its police department. "When they heard of how he was eventually killed, that he died of asphyxiation, they were visibly shaken. They are angry because this was preventable, and have therefore exercised their right to seek justice in the court," Hecht said in a written statement. The family is making funeral arrangements for Damour, Hecht said. "They appreciate the outpouring of sympathy from across the country. They are terribly upset about what happened to their family member," Hecht said. On Tuesday, lawyers said two Nassau County men who claim they were injured at the store also are suing Wal-Mart. Their lawyers also filed a notice of a $2 million claim against the Nassau County Police Department. The mall's owners, Vornado Realty Trust, refused comment on the lawsuit in a statement issued Wednesday. "We are saddened by the tragic occurrence, but we do not comment on pending or threatened litigation," the company said. Hank Mullany, Wal-Mart's northeast division president, released a statement about Damour's death Wednesday, which began by saying that Thursday morning, the company will release November's sales numbers. "This event is overshadowed by the tragic death of Jdimytai Damour at our Valley Stream, New York, store. We have been in communication with members of his family to do what we can to help them through this difficult time," the statement said. "We will continue to work with local law enforcement officials so that together we can implement even stronger safety measures going forward."
Tiffany Sessions was a 20-year-old junior studying economics at the University of Florida in Gainesville when she decided to go out for a run. She never came back. College student Tiffany Sessions has been missing since February 9, 1989. Sessions left her off-campus apartment about 6 p.m. February 9, 1989. She told her roommate she'd be back shortly and took her Walkman with her. It was the last time anyone would see her. That was 20 years ago, a time when no one had cell phones, Blackberries or Web sites to aid in tracking a missing or abducted person. The only clues came from people who recalled seeing a young woman fitting Sessions' description walking down the main street just before dusk. Sessions' jogging route usually took her down Gainesville's main street to a small dirt trail that cut through the woods. The loop was 1½ miles each way and took her about an hour. Police and family believe that she was abducted near the woods. After extensive searches, no clues were found: not her remains, not her Walkman, not the clothes she was wearing. "Much of the area in the last decade has been paved over, with new construction, making a search today very difficult," said Detective Bob Dean of the Alachua County Sheriff's Office. However, investigators are still searching and working this case actively. Searchers were out as recently as late December, seeking clues with newer technologies. "We have used ground sonar equipment, even," Dean said. Over the years, there have been some possible suspects -- people who came forward and confessed -- but police have ruled them out as credible suspects. One potential suspect was a man who was in jail for killing a 5-year-old girl. He'd written a letter to police, claiming he was responsible for Tiffany Sessions' disappearance. But when questioned later by police, he denied writing the letter, even though handwriting analysis indicated that he had. "Although police don't think so, I still believe this guy could have something to do with my daughter's disappearance," said Patrick Sessions, Tiffany's father. According to Patrick Sessions, who has been closely involved with the police investigating his daughter's case, the man who confessed was a sex offender who had been released just a month and a half before Tiffany Sessions disappeared. The cold case unit of the Alachua County Sheriff's Office has taken over this case. Patrick Sessions observed the 20th anniversary of his daughter's disappearance by making renewed appeals through the media. Police and family urge anyone with more information about Tiffany Sessions or information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for her disappearance to call the tip line at 352-367-4161. A $25,000 reward is offered. Tiffany Sessions was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a white sweatshirt with the word "Aspen" on it, a gold Rolex watch and a black Sony Walkman. She was 5'3" and weighed 125 pounds at the time of her disappearance. She has blonde hair and brown eyes.
The saga of Jack the cat, the lost pet that roamed New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for weeks before being found last month, has an unhappy ending. The feline had to be euthanized Sunday evening, American Airlines announced on Facebook, where the cat's plight has attracted thousands of followers. "We are deeply saddened that Jack the cat has passed away, and we offer profound sympathy to Jack's owner, Karen Pascoe, for her loss," the airline wrote. "From all of us at American, our sincere apologies to Karen and Jack's family and friends." It was less than two weeks ago the airline announced that Jack had turned up in Kennedy's customs room after being missing for two months. The carrier originally described him as "well," but a health check revealed a number of problems. "Jack had extensive wounds on the back of his body, and the wounds were unable to heal because his skin had deteriorated due to the malnutrition that occurred while he was lost," said Pascoe's friends in a post on "Jack The Cat is Lost in AA Baggage at JFK," the Facebook page devoted to the cat, which has more than 24,000 followers. "Jack had been through so much, and the last thing anyone wanted was for him to suffer more." The saga started August 25 when Pascoe was flying from New York to San Francisco with Jack and a second cat as part of a job relocation. But Jack escaped his kennel and was last seen at Kennedy's inbound baggage claim. (A Department of Transportation Pet Incident Report released last month explains how it happened: A clerk placed one kennel on top of another on a baggage cart and the kennel on top fell. The impact "caused the kennel to separate," allowing the cat to escape.) When a search failed to turn up Jack after a few days, Pascoe became frustrated with American and started the Facebook page "to help us put pressure on AA to step up their efforts." She also urged fliers to "do whatever they can do to keep their animals out of cargo." The airline said it did everything it could to find Jack. While the cat was missing, workers placed food and water around the airport and set up humane traps. American even hired a pet detective and issued a pet Amber Alert in hopes of locating the feline. When Jack was found, the airline promised to cover his veterinary bills. The cat's owner hopes Jack's death will spur improvements in how airlines transport pets "so that no one else ever has to go through this again," her supporters wrote on Facebook.
Walking in on an already occupied bathroom can be awkward and uncomfortable, but when that occupant is a 12-foot python, it can be terrifying. But that's just what happened to Veronica Rodriguez of College Station, Texas, last week when she discovered an African rock python in her bathtub. Police and animal control officers were called and able to capture the intruder, which Rodriguez surmises came through her open back door. Aggieland Humane Society Executive Director Kathy Bice told CNN affiliate KTRK that the snake was legally owned and that its owner had reported it missing two months ago.
50,000 of them. Maybe more. The country's Prime Minister has found as many so-called "ghost" soldiers, he told Parliament on Sunday. "Ghost" soldiers are members of the armed forces, who pay off their commanders with a portion of their salaries, so they don't have to man their posts. "Only by checking paperwork, I managed during this month to eliminate 50,000 ghost soldiers in four Iraqi army divisions," Haider al-Abadi said. Lawmakers erupted in shouts at his announcement. Investigators are looking for additional cases, and al-Abadi expects many more to turn up. "I feel sad that all that time we were paying salaries, and we don't have money, while other soldiers are fighting and getting killed, and some soldiers are getting paid without appearing," he said. The Prime Minister vowed to punish those responsible. ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has captured and held broad swaths of territory in Iraq's north and west. Iraqi military forces have often appeared in disarray while doing battle against the extremists.
Prom night sends most teen girls on a dizzying quest for the perfect dress, accessories and hairstyle to make their ensemble complete. On her prom night, Jennifer DeFreece was harried by one simple detail: "I just wanted eyebrows for my prom pictures." When she was just a baby, DeFreece was diagnosed with alopecia totalis, an autoimmune disease that results in the total loss of scalp hair. By her 1st birthday, she'd lost all of her hair. "I was like Charlie Brown," says DeFreece, now 33 and living in Northridge, California. Alopecia is nondiscriminatory. It can occur in men and women at any age and is a strictly physical disease, but sufferers say it's also a disease of the spirit, exacting a devastating emotional toll in this world of silky shampoo commercials and Rapunzel fairy tales. For those who experience it, particularly women who often self-identify with the color and style of their locks, it's about learning to manage the disease and not be defined by it. They choose a way to self-present: wig, no wig, clean shaven or a little of each. DeFreece ventured into wearing wigs in kindergarten as the childish innocence of her peers grew more inquisitive and uncensored. She continued to do so throughout junior high. At the time, the wigs available were "very obvious," she says. Before then, being bald never seemed taboo; it was her normal. Then came sleepover age: A girl insisted DeFreece put a housecoat over the pillow where she would rest her head. To that girl, baldness was gross. In those years, DeFreece says she became more shy and hyperaware about what made her different. "I hated it. I would wish that my hair would grow back," DeFreece says. In high school, when she realized people might make fun of her anyway, she took one a giant leap toward self-awareness: She decided to ditch the hairpiece and embrace the beauty of bald. Brave middle schooler tells peers she's bald "I thought, 'Let them make fun of somebody with a medical condition, let's see what happens,' " she says. The response was mature: People backed off and even stood up for her. Learning to value yourself and not your hair According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, a big part of the coping process is about "learning to value yourself for who you are, not for how much hair you have or don't have." Sue McHale is a psychology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University in England, and has extensively researched the psychological toll of the disease, including co-authoring the book, "Coping with Alopecia." "Baldness, for whatever reason, is associated firstly with aging and secondly with illness," McHale said in an e-mail. "So society is automatically shocked or fearful of this." McHale's co-researcher and husband, Nigel Hunt, has alopecia universalis, the rarest form of the disease, one that results in total loss of body hair. (The most common form of alopecia is alopecia areata, which causes the hair to fall out in patches.) When McHale found there was hardly any psychological research done on the disease, they dug in. "It opened up a floodgate of responses and many said that they felt no one had been listening to them for years," she says. It was no longer just a physical diagnosis. She says their research found that there was a perception from both sexes that it was worse for women; that it seemed more acceptable for men to appear bald. However, both men and women with alopecia aren't opting to go bald -- "it is forced upon them, so in that way, they respond to it very much in the same way," she says. Those who are balding or are born with a hairless pate can experience embarrassment, hopelessness, hastiness for a "quick fix," and, if a wig wearer, the fear that others might find out that their hair actually isn't their own. She found a man who didn't care about hair For Lauren Crawford, 29, that feeling came to a head on a first date in high school. After a few previous dates didn't handle her diagnosis so well, she decided to lay it all out on the table that very first night, warning him that she had something to confess. "'If you want to walk out the door, that's OK,'" she remembers saying. "Oh thank God," her date responded. "That's it?!" Crawford, of Macomb, Michigan, has been married to the man to whom she made that first-date confession for five years. Crawford, like DeFreece, received a diagnosis early on in life -- at 3 -- but didn't see more serious aspects of the disease, especially psychologically, until her senior year in high school. "I didn't think anything of it," she says. Seeing a bald woman wasn't out of her realm of experience; her grandmother was going through chemotherapy at the same time. As her hairline changed rapidly in her teen years, she sought solace in scrunchies and scarves. When those no longer did the job, she and her mom went wig shopping. Her friends at the time started to call her "Baldy" and tugged at her hair. She admits feeling like she would never get married and never have kids. Now, she has both -- and an unforeseen career as a hairdresser. "I always had a creative eye for hair; I was always creative in hiding my bald spots," says Crawford, who wears a wig every day, calling it "an accessory." For other women, Crawford has become an unlikely ally. She recounts how a woman came in heartbroken as the effects of chemotherapy laid her scalp bare. Crawford took her wig off and showed her true self; they wept together and talked through the change. "It's just hair," she remembers saying. 'For me to walk out bald, it's so hard' Vanessa McWilliams, 30, of Calgary is in a more transitional period -- often forgoing the wigs that were her safety blankets for more than 20 years. "I love who I am, but at the same time, for me to walk out bald, it's so hard because there's so much trauma growing up," she says, recalling jabs such as "baldy" throughout her teenage years. With the new hairless territory, she says she had to adapt to the occasional awkward moment of a stranger approaching her because they think she's sick. "You're healthy! There's nothing wrong with you, but society still has to look at you. It's so hard to hear there's nothing wrong with you. The mentality of it is still a mental battle. It's really tricky," she says. Unlike DeFreece and Crawford, who were too young at the time of their diagnosis to comprehend the condition, McWilliams didn't receive her diagnosis until adolescence. "From the date that I found my first bald spot (at age 9) until I was 17, I had a really big hatred for the word 'alopecia' and everything that it put me through," she says. McWilliams now operates Confident Curls, a mobile wig boutique specifically geared toward women who are coping with hair loss. Her epiphany: She's lived with this every single day and knows first-hand what people in the same situation need. "I wish at 9 years old I had known that it was OK. It's so simple. ... Everyone is dealt something they have to struggle with," McWilliams says. "Now, I know it isn't the worst thing that could happen to me." But there's always work to do. DeFreece calls those less-than-pretty-feeling days, as all people have, "an alopecia day." There are also upsides: "People will always remember you, and you can use that as an advantage," she says. She has met a network of women through organizations such as the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (DeFreece attends its annual conference every year) and social media, which has helped her adjust. When they get together, their lack of hair isn't the glaring beacon it is to others. "I'm not just Jennifer the bald girl. I'm Jennifer the marketing major. I'm Jennifer from California," DeFreece says.
in the words of this father -- "on the tip of the spear." "David was a patriot. David was a warrior when he needed to be, and also a peacemaker," James Berry said about his son. "He was intelligent and resourceful. He would not break down in a fight when liberty, freedom and justice was at stake. I lost a son yesterday, but I believe in what David did, and I stand proud of him while I privately mourn," he told CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" on Wednesday. The Libyan branch of ISIS has claimed responsibility for the gun and bomb attack that killed five foreigners, including Berry, an American security contractor. Five Libyans also died in Tuesday's attack on the Corinthia Hotel, said a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, Essam al-Naas. Two attackers were killed, he said, saying it appeared they were Libyans. The five-star hotel is known as one where foreigners and government officials stay and meet to conduct business. The Libyan branch of ISIS released photos of the two gunmen it said had carried out the attacks, identifying them as Abu Ibraheem Al-Tunsi and Abu Sulaiman Al-Sudani. Their naming convention indicates that the men were of Tunisian and Sudanese origin, respectively. The FBI is expected to open an investigation into the incident, two U.S. officials told CNN. According to military records, Berry was in the U.S. Marine Corps, completing six deployments in Afghanistan, Kuwait and Iraq. He retired in September 2012, after a dozen years of service. He was working for Crucible, a security firm. According to its website, the Virginia-based firm "provides high-risk environment training and global security solutions to employees of the U.S. government, NGOs, and multinational corporations who live and work in dangerous and austere locations worldwide." His father said Berry was fluent in Arabic and knew his way around the Arab world. "He knew how to approach Arabic people on a foreign shore and not ... discriminate against them -- not come across as, 'I'm am American warrior and I'm going to do it this way.' He was very conciliatory in nature," James Berry said. His son leaves behind a wife and four children. The other foreigners killed in the attack were a French citizen and three people from Tajikistan, al-Naas said. The French Foreign Ministry confirmed that a French citizen was among the dead but did not identify the victim. The Tripoli government, which is not internationally recognized, said the intended target of the attack was its prime minister, Omar al-Hassi, but the claim has not been confirmed. Al-Naas said that at least two Libyan security personnel were killed in the attack. An online group that supports ISIS said the attack was carried out in the name of Abu Anas al-Libi. He was an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa. He was captured by U.S. special forces in Tripoli in 2013. He died in a U.S. hospital this month. It's this declared link to al-Libi's capture by the United States that has prompted the FBI to investigate. Fighters loyal to ISIS have for several months been in control of the Mediterranean port city of Derna in eastern Libya, near the border with Egypt. They are suspected in other attacks elsewhere in Libya, including in Tobruk, Al-Bayda and Tripoli. Tuesday's attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel. The gunmen then shot their way into the hotel. The high-rise hotel is popular among government officials, some of whom live there. Until now, it was seen as one of the remaining secure locations in Tripoli for diplomatic and government activity. The attack, different in scale and coordination to those seen previously -- even after months of violence in Libya's east -- sends the message that nowhere in the country, or its capital, is safe. Authorities say they are now in control of the hotel premises and are starting their investigation. The self-proclaimed Tripoli government, formed by a coalition of militias, holds sway only over the capital and surrounding areas. The internationally recognized parliament was forced to leave the capital after militia groups seized control of the city in the summer. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, the United Nations and other international organizations and businesses also evacuated their staffs from Tripoli in the summer due to the unrest. The U.S. State Department last week issued a warning advising U.S. citizens against all travel to Libya and recommending that any U.S. citizens currently in the North African country should leave immediately. "Extremist groups in Libya have made several specific threats against U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests in Libya," it said. "Because of the presumption that foreigners, especially U.S. citizens, in Libya may be associated with the U.S. government or U.S. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), travelers should be aware that they may be targeted for kidnapping, violent attacks, or death."

Wearing a stylish red dress and a beaming smile, celebrated fashion designer Adama Paris sits comfortably inside her spacious living room in Dakar, the vibrant seaside capital of Senegal, as we discuss her inspirations. "My designing process starts always with me," explains Paris. "With what I want to wear; with what is in my closet -- my style is multi-cultural, it's eclectic, it's the mix of my travels, it's bold, it's rocky," she adds. "It's African." Indeed, for more than a decade the Senegalese designer has been putting African fashion to global runways and clothing stores -- from New York and London to Paris and Tokyo. But besides spreading her stylish vision around the world, Paris is also bringing attention closer to home -- 12 years ago she founded Dakar Fashion Week, a popular event allowing designers from all over West Africa and beyond to showcase their colorful creations to fashion lovers and international media. "The fashion scene in Senegal is so bold," says Paris, whose real name is Adama Amanda Ndiaye. "I have seen it grow like a baby and I am so proud to be a part of this." Black Fashion Week Following the initial success of the Dakar Fashion week, Paris began receiving invitations to attend big designers' shows in fashion capitals like London and New York. But whilst there, she quickly started feeling like an outsider. "I was really frustrated," she says. "When I looked around there were so few black models and I felt like I wasn't belonging there." That frustration was behind Paris' decision to start Black Fashion Week in 2010 to help promote the talented black designers and models that she felt were being ignored by the industry. Paris held the inaugural event in the Czech Republic, followed by editions in Paris, Montreal, Geneva and Bahia. "I thought it was right ... to try to do something to help my own people and to get more exposure," she says. "It was not saying them they were wrong, it was saying, 'OK, we are here,'" adds Paris. "It was also a statement [to] the fashion industry, 'stop this discrimination, black is beautiful.' I am sick and tired of seeing only skinny blonde girls and not black women in the runway." From the runway to the TV screen The daughter of diplomats, Paris spent much of her childhood traveling and soaking up other cultures before finally settling in France where she attended college. She first made a name for herself in the French capital but decided to bring her fashion home to Senegal in 2001. Now, with a thriving label and flourishing annual events under her belt, the fashion entrepreneur is taking on her next business venture -- TV. A two-year project in the making, Paris has had her heart set on creating a new avenue to promote local fashion talent. Starting with a reality show she describes as the "equivalent of America's Next Top Model," Paris wants to provide new opportunities for aspiring young models from the continent. "We wanted really young girls and give them [an] opportunity to go outside Senegal to model in Africa -- South Africa, Angola [and] also in Europe. This is going to be a big deal because it is probably going to start their career." Her other goal is to introduce viewers to alternative fashion designers. While there are currently channels devoted to fashion, Paris explains that they don't show enough African inspiration and when they do, coverage tends to focus on designers from South Africa. "I want them to see us in Nigeria, Ghana, Dakar. That was the purpose of this channel," she says. "I want people to see we have great designers. And that's what I'm going to show -- Africans wearing African clothes," adds Paris. Fashion made in Africa by Africans."

and even mentioned Edwards by name in the call -- because the four teens had grown up together, he told Fairfax Media. Police arrived and took the three into custody. Police say Jones later told them, "We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody." Opinion: Negligent parents, lawbreaking kids Edwards' older sister, Rachel Padilla, told CNN on Thursday that her brother hung around with some older guys who were thought to be in a gang, and that other people have told her Edwards was in one -- but she said she doesn't want to believe it. Asked about it by CNN, Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said there are no gang members in town. Brown, the mayor, said the town has been able to control gang activity. "That's not to say that something might slip in on us, but I don't think we have a real problem with that," Brown told CNN. "If we do, we definitely need to look into it." Shock and sorrow after shooting Richard Rhodes, a 37-year-old contractor who was working on a house near where the shooting happened, tried to save Lane's life by performing CPR, he told Fairfax Media. "I was like this, telling him, 'Buddy, stay with us; stay with us,'" Rhodes said, showing how he knelt next to the victim. Lane, 23, was gasping for air, and soon the gasps stopped. Rhodes and a woman together performed CPR until it became apparent that Lane had died, Fairfax reported. Lane's friends and family are being invited to a memorial game in his honor Sunday, and a donation page has been set up to raise money for a memorial fund in his name. A former student and classmate at East Central University, where Lane was studying, described him as "a charming guy, genuinely good person, with great character and had a love for life." "As cliched as it sounds, Chris was the kind of guy you want your sons to grow up to be and that you want your daughters to marry. It just breaks my heart knowing how much more he could have brought to this world as a husband, father, son, brother and friend," Sam Malchar said.
Samsung's flagship smartphone could be getting twice as fast. The South Korean electronics company plans to release a quicker version of the Galaxy S4, says CEO J.K. Shin. He told Reuters it will be for sale in South Korea later this month. The phones, which will be powered by a new Qualcomm processor, use what's being called LTE-advanced technology, which will reportedly deliver data at speeds up to twice those of current 4G LTE connections. Some downloads could be even quicker. A movie that takes three minutes to download on the current Galaxy S4 would take one minute on the new phone, Samsung told Reuters Shin said Samsung is in talks with carriers in other countries about the phone. He did not specify which countries, or carriers. The Galaxy S4 has been Samsung's most popular smartphone yet. It passed 10 million sales in its first month -- a clip that outpaced its predecessor, the S3, which emerged as the Android system's most successful rival to the iPhone. Recently, though, both Apple and Samsung have seen a slowdown in sales of top-end smartphones, as that market has shown signs of becoming saturated. An even faster S4, obviously, would be an effort to appeal to that upper-tier buyer who's willing to fork over cash for the fanciest and fastest new models. Shin told Reuters the new model would be "slightly more expensive" than the current S4, which sells for $199 and up, depending on the carrier and which service plan the customer signs up for. Last month, Samsung announced that it will be making a smaller version of the S4. That phone will be unveiled at an event Thursday. There also have been unconfirmed reports that Apple will release a cheaper version of its iPhone. As the high-end market tightens up, Apple, Samsung and other phone makers are eyeing developing countries, where interest in smartphones is still growing.
Megan Sowards and Matt Gorman -- are poised to play key roles in a potential Bush campaign. Ever since the prospect of a third Romney campaign became serious, Bush has played nice about his potential competitor. According to Bloomberg Politics, Bush praised the 2012 nominee at a private fundraiser Wednesday in Washington, saying he doesn't expect he'll need to wage ugly campaigns against his opponents to win a primary. Neither Bush nor Romney are scheduled so far to attend a major gathering of conservatives this weekend in Iowa. Nearly 10 prospective Republican candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, will speak at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines on Saturday hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King. While Bush's absence has stoked speculation that the former governor might plan to leave the first-in-the-nation caucus state out of his campaign strategy, Bush called the state's GOP chairman on Wednesday to assure him that he plans to make Iowa a priority, the Des Moines Register reported. "What I heard is a man that's ready to come out and tackle the Hawkeye state," Kaufmann said, though he noted that Bush stressed he's still only considering a run and hasn't become an official candidate. Last week Ted Gatsas, mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire, tweeted that Bush had called him and told him he plans on coming to the Granite State, which holds the nominating season's first primary, at some point, according to the Union Leader. CNN's Dana Bash and Gloria Borger contributed to this report.
A tiny handwritten and unpublished manuscript by "Jane Eyre" author Charlotte Bronte has sold for $1.07m after it sparked a fierce bidding war between rival museums. The second issue of Bronte's "Young Men's Magazine" -- written in 1830 when she was just 14 -- smashed pre-sale estimates of $310,000 to $465,000, and set a record for manuscripts by the Bronte sisters. It contains three stories, written in Bronte's tiny, cramped hand, one of which is said to prefigure the story of Bertha, Mr. Rochester's insane wife in "Jane Eyre." It was bought by the Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris, where it will go on display in January. The Bronte Parsonage Museum, in the family's hometown of Haworth, Yorkshire, had earlier launched an appeal to raise money to allow them to buy it, but were outbid in the sale at Sotheby's in London. Philip Errington, director of the auction house's books and manuscripts department, said the Bronte item was "of huge literary significance." "The record price set today reflects the international interest in Charlotte BrontÃ«'s work. "This tiny manuscript represents her first burst of creativity and provides a rare and intimate insight into one of history's great literary minds." The Bronte Parsonage Museum already owns four of the six manuscripts in the "Young Men's Magazine" series. The whereabouts of the sixth magazine are unknown. Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855) and her sisters Emily (1818-1848) and Anne (1820-1849) wrote some of the best-loved novels in the English language, including "Jane Eyre," "Wuthering Heights" and "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall."
The tragic death of Moritz Erhardt, a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has cast a spotlight on the extreme work culture in the financial industry. The hours that Erhardt had been working are not unusual. Many finance professionals often work into the wee hours of the morning. Their weekends are spent recovering from grueling workweeks. Their holidays are spent constantly checking in with the office. The result is that work begins to take up nearly every waking hour. There is little time left for life. The extreme work culture used to be the preserve of a few elite professions, such as banking or law. Now it seems to be spreading. Employees in many jobs are being asked to make themselves constantly available. Partly, it's because new technologies allow people to be connected and reachable at all times. But it comes at a huge cost. There is a significant body of research that shows long working hours have negative physical and psychological effects on people. A recent study by professor Alexandra Michel tracked investment bankers over a nine-year period. These bankers would routinely work from early morning to well past midnight. To cope with these hours, many became gym junkies, taking to the treadmill after midnight for an hourlong run. However, after about seven years of this relentless grind, the bankers began to suffer serious psychological and physical breakdowns. In addition to damaging the body and mind, long hours at work cut people off from their family and friends. People who spend most of their waking hours at work or dealing with work-related activities have little time to build and nurture relationships outside of work. Their intimate relationships with family can become strained. Their friendships can become weak. If something goes wrong, they may feel isolated and helpless because they lack a healthy ecosystem for emotional support. The result is that their social network withers and, over time, can die. Extreme hours have been proven to be unhealthy for workers. They are also bad for communities. If days are spent only working, then there is little time to put into local clubs, faith groups and associations. Harvard professor Robert Putnam has pointed out that the long working hour culture has led to a stunning decline in the numbers of people who are members of clubs and associations. It has effectively weakened the fabric of our communities. People are increasingly cut off, to the extent that it's common not to know your neighbors or anyone in your neighborhood. What is perhaps most surprising is that long hours are not even good for companies. The most productive countries among the developed economies often have the shortest work hours. Employees in Germany and France work less hours but get more done. Their British counterparts spend much longer at work but produce far less. Not only that, when people are tired from long hours, they tend to make more irrational and risky decisions. A recent study by the Swedish sociologist Roland Paulsen has shown that long hours at work also lead to the prevalence of unproductive "empty work" such as checking Facebook, watching YouTube videos or even undertaking personal projects at the office. It's possible that these are ways for employees to show resistance. There are so many good reasons to end the extreme work culture. But how can it be done? A first step is for companies to introduce policies and practices that stop employees from working through the night. These might include having work-life balance programs, or closing the doors to the office at a reasonable hour or banning e-mail traffic after a particular time at night. As important as these top-down changes are, employees need to instigate bottom-up changes. These require us to avoid modeling and encouraging the practice of working long hours among new recruits. We have to make it acceptable to say "no" to an extreme work culture. Remember, we work to live, not live to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andre Spicer.
The Department of Justice served the state of West Virginia two subpoenas this week, the governor's office said late Friday, adding that they had "not been informed that Governor [Joe] Manchin or any other state employee is under investigation." The statement came after West Virginia Watchdog, a state chapter of the nonprofit Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, reported the subpoenas are part of a federal grand jury investigation into work done at the Governor's Mansion in Charleston. West Virginia Watchdog asked for contracts and records for businesses that have done work at the mansion. The Justice Department had no comment. Manchin's office said in a written statement that neither of the two subpoenas "was directed to Governor Manchin or the Governor's Office" and that "no individual" in his office was served. "The Governor has directed State officials to fully cooperate and comply expeditiously," the statement said. "Governor Manchin wants to get to the bottom of the issue as soon as possible." Steven Allen Adams, the West Virginia Watchdog managing editor who also works for the conservative-leaning Public Policy Foundation of West Virginia, cited an unnamed source who said Manchin was the target of the probe. Manchin, a Democrat, has been in office since 2005. He announced in July he would seek to fill the unexpired term of the late Sen. Robert Byrd.
Al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda's brutal Somali affiliate, has claimed credit for the attack by multiple gunmen at an upscale shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya that has already killed at least 59 people. This should not be a surprise. For Al-Shabaab, the mall was an attractive target because Westerners, including Americans, frequented it. The mall is also in the capital of Kenya, a country that Al-Shabaab has good reason to dislike, as the Kenyan military played a major role in handing their forces a defeat last year when they liberated the key Somali port of Kismayo from their control. Al-Shabaab ("the Youth") tweeted Saturday that "all Muslims inside #Westgate" -- referring to the mall that was attacked in Nairobi -- "were escorted out by the Mujahideen before" the armed assault commenced. Members of Al-Shabaab use Twitter frequently to communicate their messages to the world. The group has recruited around 40 young American men and also dozens from Europe and has shown that it is comfortable with Internet technology, despite the fact that Somalia is one of the poorest and most anarchic countries on the planet. Dozens killed, scores wounded, hostages taken More than 10% of the Kenyan population is Muslim. So it is interesting that Shabaab took the precaution of evacuating Muslims from the Nairobi mall they were attacking, suggesting a greater sophistication in the tactics of this attack than the group has shown hitherto in Somalia, where they have killed large numbers of civilians indiscriminately in a country that is almost entirely Muslim. Before he was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs two years ago, even Osama bin Laden had scolded members of Al-Shabaab, telling them to try to avoid killing Muslim civilians. In a letter that was recovered in the house in Pakistan where bin Laden was killed, al-Qaeda's leader warned Shabaab members that they were killing too many civilians in battles in and around the key Bakara market in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Saturday's attack on the Nairobi mall seems to owe some of its tactics to Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani terrorist group that attacked upscale hotels catering to Westerners in Mumbai, India, in November 2008 over the course of more than three days, killing 166 people. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness In both the Nairobi and Mumbai attacks, a group of armed gunmen shot at civilians indiscriminately and conducted the operation in a manner that would guarantee sustained media coverage over many hours and even days by taking a large number of hostages. In both assaults, the gunmen did not negotiate for the release of hostages but went into the operation seemingly prepared for a fight to the death. Al-Shabaab has previously shown that it is capable of carrying out operations outside of Somalia, bombing two groups of fans watching the World Cup on television in Kampala, Uganda, on July 11, 2010, killing more than 70. The group seemed to have carried out that operation because Uganda had provided troops to a United Nations-authorized African Union mission then fighting Al-Shabaab in Somalia. The group has also shown an interest in targets in the West. Eight months before the attack in Uganda, a 28-year-old Somali man armed with a knife and an ax had forced himself into the home of Kurt Westergaard -- a Danish cartoonist who had depicted the Prophet Mohammed with a bomb in his turban -- and tried unsuccessfully to break into the panic room where Westergaard was hiding. Danish intelligence officials said the suspect had links with Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has managed to plant al-Qaeda-like ideas into the heads of even its American recruits. Shirwa Ahmed, an ethnic Somali, graduated from high school in Minneapolis in 2003, then worked pushing passengers in wheelchairs at the Minneapolis airport. During this period Ahmed was radicalized; the exact mechanisms of that radicalization are still murky, but in late 2007 he traveled to Somalia. About a year later, on October 29, 2008, Ahmed drove a truck loaded with explosives toward a government compound in Puntland, northern Somalia, blowing himself up and killing about 20 people, including United Nations peacekeeping troops and international humanitarian assistance workers. The FBI matched Ahmed's finger, recovered at the scene, to fingerprints already on file for him. Ahmed was the first American terrorist suicide attacker anywhere. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack The attack on the Nairobi mall may be an attempt by Al-Shabaab to signal its continued relevance. Over the past three years, Al-Shabaab has lost substantial territory and influence in Somalia. Al-Shabaab controlled much of southern Somalia in 2010, but operations by African Union and Kenyan forces have ended its domination of southern Somalia. In 2011, the U.N.-sanctioned African Union mission partnered with Somali troops to fight Al-Shabaab militants, and in August of that year, African Union and Somali government forces defeated Al-Shabaab forces in Mogadishu, forcing the militants from a stronghold they had controlled since 2009. Although Al-Shabaab has long been regarded as a regional offshoot of al-Qaeda, its leaders only declared their formal ties to the international terror organization in February 2012. While the group seems to have been interested in an alliance before then, in 2010, bin Laden instructed the group's leaders to keep their association with al-Qaeda a secret, fearing that openly linking the groups would be bad for Al-Shabaab's fundraising efforts. By February 2012, however, bin Laden was dead and Al-Shabaab had suffered significant losses in its southern Somali safe haven. Al-Qaeda's new leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who had earlier petitioned bin Laden to reconsider his views about the proposed merger between Al-Shabaab and al-Qaeda, believed the time was right to announce formal ties between the two groups. While there are a number of American citizens fighting for a variety of al-Qaeda-affiliated or -inspired organizations, Al-Shabaab seems to boast the most American fighters. According to a 2011 report by the House Committee on Homeland Security, an estimated 40 Americans have joined Al-Shabaab in the last few years, at least 24 of them coming from the Somali community in Minnesota. Al-Shabaab has prominently featured these recruits in its propaganda operations, releasing three official videos that starred Abu Mansoor al-Amriki ("the father of Mansoor, the American"), who is actually Omar Hammami, in his late 20s from Alabama, who was raised as a Baptist and converted to Islam in high school. One of the videos shows Hammami preparing an ambush and features English rap lyrics extolling jihad. Hammami was reported to have been killed on September 12 during the course of some kind of an internal conflict within the Al-Shabaab group. The news of his death was confirmed on Hammami's Twitter account four days later.
Dutch champions AZ Alkmaar have confirmed Dick Advocaat as their new head coach until the end of the season. AZ sought permission from the Belgian FA (KBVB) over the possibility of their national-team coach joining them for the rest of the campaign after sacking Ronald Koeman on Saturday. A statement posted on the club's official Web site said: "AZ and Dick Advocaat reached agreement on Tuesday on a contract for him to be head coach until the end of the current season. "The 62-year-old will combine the role with the job of Belgium coach and will be on the bench against PSV on Saturday." The Alkmaar club won the Eredivisie under Louis van Gaal last season but have struggled this term and currently find themselves in seventh place, 19 points behind leaders FC Twente. The former Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven and Rangers coach has already set out his goal for the season. "We need to get European football at AZ," Advocaat told AZ TV. "If we do not get that, then I have done something wrong." AZ face Standard Liege in Belgium in their final Champions League Group Group H game on Wednesday.
Tens of thousands of Egyptians, angered by their nation's slow progress toward reforms, converged in Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square on Friday to pressure the interim government to speed up the process. Protesters are determined not to leave until their demands are met, said Walid Rashid, one of the founding members of Egypt's pro-reform April 6 youth movement. Their intentions to stay were reflected in the number of tents that popped up in the square, the center of the revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak from power February 11. Five months after that historic event, Egyptians are disgruntled with the slow pace of change. Some protesters said they planned to remain in the square for 18 days, the length of the revolution. In recent days, anti-government demonstrations have raged, sometimes devolving into clashes. On July 2, armed men attacked protesters at the square. A group called the January 25 Coalition has issued a range of demands, calling for the removal of Cairo's head of security and an investigation into the violence at the rallies. The group, named for the day anti-government protests began this year, also called for the release of those detained after the demonstrations. The military-led government that took over when Mubarak resigned has been prosecuting several former officials accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters. A police officer accused of killing 20 protesters during a January 28 demonstration has been sentenced to death. Mubarak is scheduled to face the Cairo Criminal Court on August 3 on charges of corruption and deaths of protesters, officials said. At least 25 former Egyptian government officials have been referred to the Cairo Criminal Court with charges related to the February 2 attack in Tahrir Square, known as the Battle of the Camel, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor's office. They include former members of parliament, businessmen and members of the dissolved National Democratic Party. The suspects include Safwat El Sherif, the former head of the Shura Council, and Fathi Suror, the former speaker of the Egyptian parliament. Egypt's military rulers have set parliamentary elections for September. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.
a representation of the soul of this part of the Mississippi River Delta, where a body of water and centuries of history largely separate the rich from poor. Surely, he must have something to say about the American Dream. As I wandered around both sides of Lake Providence, the town and the sickle-shaped body of water that separates the rich on the north from the poor on the south, I looked for the man with the American flag at every turn -- on Lake Street, with its boarded-up businesses; at the Grab Bag, a local gathering point; near a cemetery, where locals go to scratch off lottery tickets; at the Dock, a restaurant with a cartoonish red crawfish on the roof and warning signs for alligators. I struck out, again and again. I began to wonder whether the man and the flag actually existed. There's that scene in every great Western film (and in a dream sequence in "Wayne's World 2") where the cowboy looks across the desert and sees an elder or shaman in the heat-rippled haze of the horizon. Maybe all of these people imagined the man and his flag? Maybe they wanted a source of hope in a place that's about as economically depressed and desperate as they come. About 40% of people in the parish live in poverty. There would be good cause for a mirage. A reason for an imaginary mascot. But then, five days into the trip, I saw him He was sitting on a metal parking barrier off Interstate 65. I was scheduled to interview the owner of My Dream Eatery, a rare new-business success story in a town that needs plenty more of those. But I knew I would miss him if I went to the interview. Hell, I was worried if I looked away, he would disappear. I peeked my head into the restaurant as quickly as I could to say that I was going to be a few minutes, sorry, but something had just come up. As I walked toward him across the parking lot, I tried to look nonchalant but also wanted to catch his attention by waving, which is an impossible combination -- one employed successfully only by Mormon missionaries or maybe sex offenders. I said hello -- hi, ahem, my name is John, and I'm from CNN. I'm working on this story, and I, well, I've heard about you. (!) I mean, I've heard about you. (...) George Estes, 59, was kind enough to speak with me. The American flag was neatly folded and wrapped around a backpack, not his shoulders. He was wearing several layers of clothing, a dress shirt, a tie, a tuxedo vest and a jacket. It felt like 100 degrees that day. Few clouds, if any. As we talked, he wiped beads of sweat from his face. But he looked completely and remarkably dapper for a person who walks five, six, seven, eight miles a day -- going nowhere and everywhere in particular. He wears a large backpack, he said, to stop his back from hurting. Estes' parents both died when he was relatively young, and he dropped out of school in seventh grade. He has struggled with mental health issues, he told me. He survives on government disability insurance. "I'd rather work than just be sitting here waiting on a check," he said. But there aren't many jobs here, and he's largely given up. I told him about the gist of my project. I was in East Carroll Parish because it has the highest level of income inequality -- the biggest rich-poor gap -- of any parish or county in the country. Lake Providence is the parish's largest town. Estes told me knows nothing about the wealth that exists in the parish. That's all on the other side of the lake, far away. But he knows about the poverty. "It's just like anybody else," he said. "Surviving's about the best you can do." He lives in a rental house owned by his sister Ann Newson. She's never understood why her brother walks so much. They have 12 siblings in all, and he's the only one who insists on walking the streets all day, sometimes into the night. There are many stories I could tell you about Estes, but I'll leave you with two, both about objects he carries with him at all times as he walks around Lake Providence. The first, inside his backpack, is a cornet. Estes used to play taps and did so at his mother's funeral. Now he marches up and down the streets playing his horn, but only if he feels that God wants him to. He hasn't felt that calling in weeks. His sister told a slightly different tale. "Everyone used to love to hear him blow it," she said later. "I'm sure they would love to hear it now, but he smokes too many cigarettes." In a nod to one my new favorite philosophers, John Rawls, whose 1971 book "A Theory of Justice" is a staple among inequality wonks, I asked Estes whether he thought his life would have been different if he were born on the other side of the lake -- if he were born into wealth rather than relative poverty. My heart broke when he answered. "I probably would have been a college graduate," he said. "I probably would ... I don't know what I would've been. (An) architect? But I've always been inclined to music, because everybody loves music. "I ain't got no teeth in the front, but I still blow my horn," he said. The second object is the flag. Estes found it crumpled up and discarded on the edge of Lake Providence, the symbolically named lake that's the barrier between rich and poor. "It was abandoned, and I was abandoned, and he seen me, and I needed it." He told me he was collecting money to have the flag dry-cleaned. He was embarrassed by how dirty it had become. A few weeks later, on a second trip to Lake Providence, I saw Estes walking by the cemetery. I stopped to say hi and asked about the flag. He revived my belief in humanity when he told me a local dry cleaner tidied it up, free of charge.
On a cool January morning, Israeli ambulances sped to the site of a simulated terrorist attack in Haifa, the country's largest port city. In keeping with the script for the long-planned civil defense exercise, emergency workers responded to a suicide car bomb with one element the country has not experienced in the dozens of real terrorist bombings over the years: this simulated attack dispersed nuclear materials, a "dirty bomb" laced with radioactive Cesium 137. While life went on around them in an otherwise normal day, paramedics rushed the "victims" to area hospitals, where doctors and nurses in protective gear moved to decontaminate and treat their injuries. Elsewhere, authorities assessed the public health effects and the psychological impact on the public of hearing the words "nuclear" and "bomb" used in the same sentence referring to an attack close to home. It was not a simulation of an atomic bomb, but of a "radiological dispersal device," a much less destructive conventional weapon with some nuclear materials in the mix -- enough to spread a small amount of radiation and a great deal of panic. Nobody talked about Iran during the event. But, as with so much of what goes on in Israel these days, thoughts of how the conflict over Iran's nuclear program might ultimately unfold lurked in people's minds. For all those involved in the exercise, it was an opportunity to prepare for another one of the many disturbing scenarios that come up whenever Israelis ponder what the future may bring. Dr. Lion Poles, one of the organizers from the Ministry of Health, called it "a hypothetical but plausible scenario." When word came out months ago that the Israeli military was preparing the exercise code-named "Dark Cloud" -- the first ever drill for nuclear terrorism in the country -- authorities tried to downplay its significance. Perhaps that's why Dark Cloud received so little media attention. But Defense Minister Ehud Barak has often said that the greatest risk from Iran's nuclear program is not that Tehran will launch an atomic bomb against Israel, but that it might send a dirty bomb to explode through cargo arriving at a crowded port. After years of worrying about Iran -- and about other threats in the neighborhood -- Israelis have developed a cool and tense fatalistic attitude. Conversations with every day people show a mix of resignation, bravado, fear and a suspicion that there may not be good options. In Jerusalem, Uri Margalit, a 57-year-old salesman, says he doesn't think Israel will attack Iran, but concedes that the uncertainty of what might happen has made him and his friends nervous. "Everybody's a little afraid," he admits. Others, like Hanna Ofner, are less pessimistic. "I count on the government to do the right thing," she says, adding that she believes Europe and the U.S. understand just how risky a nuclear-armed Iran would be for the entire Middle East and the rest of the world. Polls show the public is divided about whether or not Israel should attack Iran to keep nuclear weapons out of its hands. Given that Iran's leaders have openly proclaimed their wish to see Israel destroyed, most Israelis believe a war will happen. Some Israelis tellingly confess they have restocked their bomb shelters with fresh water and other supplies. The January 18 radiological drill barely made the news in a country where national exercises to prepare for conventional missile attacks, in addition to biological and chemical weapons, have become routine in recent years. The need to prepare more actively became clear after the 2006 war with Lebanon's Hezbollah, when Hezbollah's rockets -- many of them made in Iran -- hit a greater portion of Israel than ever before, forcing more than 300,000 Israelis to evacuate their hometowns and sending about a million of them into bomb shelters. Lebanon was also affected: at least a million people were displaced during the 34 days of fighting. If the conflict with Iran does escalate into open warfare, the widespread expectation is that Hezbollah, a close ally of Iran, will attack Israel from Lebanon, while Hamas, another friend of Tehran, will do the same from Gaza. The U.S. believes Hezbollah alone has an arsenal of about 50,000 rockets and missiles, some capable of reaching practically all of Israel. While the radiological drill did not garner a lot of attention, there was another exercise -- one that did not happen -- which made large headlines. The U.S. and Israel has been preparing to hold their largest joint military maneuvers in the history of their alliance, a missile defense drill code-named "Austere Challenge 12," in April. As military officials on both sides were busy arranging for thousands of American soldiers to deploy to Israel, word came out that the war games had been postponed. The circumstances behind the sudden change of plans remain something of a mystery, with officials offering reassurances that there is no reason for concern. For Israelis, however, one of the greatest fears is that they will be abandoned to face Iran without international support. It came as some comfort that President Obama just told Time Magazine that he "will take every step available to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon." Israelis hope that will be achieved without the need for war, but they believe it is a near certainty that a military operation against Iran would result in attacks against Israel by Iran's allies. Just in case, they are preparing for any conceivable scenario while carrying on with their daily lives and hoping for the best.

Paul McCartney has rescheduled the U.S. tour dates he had originally scheduled to begin in mid-June for October. His "Out There" tour will now resume in Albany, New York on July 5. The former Beatle is still recuperating from the virus that forced him to postpone several dates in Japan and South Korea. See the rescheduled dates, as well as McCartney's July and August dates, below. Paul McCartney trades dance moves with a robot in 'Appreciate' video "I'm sorry, but it's going to be a few more weeks before we get rocking in America again," McCartney said in a statement. "I'm feeling great, but taking my docs' advice to take it easy for just a few more days. Look forward to seeing you all soon." The 71-year-old postponed a string of dates in Asia in late May when he came down with a virus and was hospitalized in Tokyo. At the time, his rep said, "He will make a complete recovery and has been ordered to take a few days rest." Paul McCartney halts auctions of cape, suit and lyric sketch Prior to postponing the U.S. tour dates, this leg of McCartney's "Out There" tour was meant to wrap up in San Francisco, where he would play the final concert at the city's Candlestick Park.

Libyans celebrated late into the evening Saturday the reported capture of Moammar Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, nabbed in a desert gunbattle after an 18-day stakeout. Senior Libyan military officials said they believe the potential Gadhafi successor was trying to make his way to neighboring Niger, where a brother, Saadi, was granted asylum. Revolutionary fighters caught the man wanted by the International Criminal Court between the southwestern oasis town of Obari and southern town of Sabha, military commanders in Tripoli told CNN. The 39-year-old, the last Gadhafi fugitive, was taken to the city of Zintan in the western mountains. Top officials in the town rejoiced over the development. Saif al-Islam had been on the run since shortly after the fall of his father's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital in August. "I hope that this is the beginning of a state of freedom, transparency and lawfulness," acting Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib told reporters in Zintan. "In the name of the great nation, we would like to allay your fears and tell you that Saif and those who were with him will be tried fairly. They are ensured all their rights under the law. These are the same rights that our nation didn't have for 42 years." The ICC in the Netherlands wants Saif al-Islam for alleged crimes against humanity, including murder, committed during the uprising this year. But officials in Libya also indicated they would like to put Saif al-Islam on trial. Although he held no high-level government office, Saif al-Islam was considered by ICC prosecutors to be Moammar Gadhafi's "unspoken successor and the most influential person with his inner circle," according to an arrest warrant issued in June. The Gadhafi regime formulated a state policy that included quelling demonstrations by lethal force, attacking civilians and imprisoning hundreds, according to the warrant. Saif al-Islam "exercised control over crucial parts of the state apparatus, including finances and logistics and had the powers of a de facto prime minister." ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said the arrest was "good news." "That is very important because we consider him -- the judges consider him -- the principal, with his father Moammar, of the crimes committed in Libya after February 13," he said. "He's arrested, he's alive, and now he will face justice and that is the most important news." Moreno-Ocampo will travel to Libya next week to coordinate efforts to bring Saif al-Islam to justice, an ICC spokeswoman said Saturday. Who is Saif al-Islam Gadhafi? "The ICC has had indirect contact with Saif al-Islam Gadhafi through intermediaries during which they discussed what would happen if he surrendered. The last contact was 25 days ago," spokeswoman Florence Olara told CNN. ICC spokesman Fadi el-Abdallah told CNN that Libya has an obligation to surrender Saif al-Islam to the ICC. If Libya wants to conduct a trial, it needs to submit a request to judges and show its legal system is capable of properly handling such a proceeding. El-Keib emphasized that "we will deal with this under our legal system," but he said the country intends to communicate and work with the ICC. "We'll get to a point where we can take care of this issue easily," El Keib said. "We definitely are interested in respecting the will of our people and also the national interests that we trust that the world will also appreciate." Justice Minister Mohammad Al-Alagy said he doubts Libyan courts would want to try Saif al-Islam for crimes against humanity. "We will weigh out the accusations against Saif Al Islam al-Gadhafi. Afterward, we will know what crimes to try him with. He's charged with killing and taking the nation's money and ... hiring mercenaries. Those are crimes the Libyan nation will currently try him for. We can't move ahead of ourselves with inaccurate accusations. We will move forward with this investigation." Military commanders told CNN they want the National Transitional Council to ensure Saif al-Islam is tried in their country. Outbursts of celebratory gunfire, the honking of horns and cries of joy could be heard in Tripoli as reports of his capture spread. Othman Mliegta, commander of the Al Qa'aq brigades, said he had been told that Saif al-Islam was slightly injured in the clashes that took place when the fighters attempted to capture him but is in good health. A picture released by Libya's National Transitional Council purportedly of Saif al-Islam appeared to show him half-lying on a low bed with bandages wrapped around the fingers of his right hand. A military commander from Zintan, Fathi Al-Ayed, told CNN that the injuries had been sustained in previous clashes rather than the firefight that led to his capture in the early hours of Saturday. Al-Ayed, who was in Obari at the time, said fighters from the Zintan Brigades had been following a vehicle convoy. As they approached, the convoy tried to flee, firing on the fighters, who returned fire. When the convoy was eventually stopped, Saif al-Islam was arrested, along with up to six others. They were taken to Zintan. Mliegta said those with Saif al-Islam when he was caught did not include his father's former intelligence chief Abdulla al-Sanussi, also wanted by the ICC. French and British officials, part of the NATO mission that supported the rebels since February, welcomed the capture. "Saif al-Islam no longer poses a threat to peace and security in Libya," said British Foreign Secretary William Hague. "His arrest will allow the Libyan people to move on to the challenge of rebuilding their country." Time.com: The reformer who refused to reform The suspect's father, who ruled the country for more than 40 years, was killed last month near Sirte after his capture by forces loyal to the National Transitional Council. Asked about guarantees of Saif al-Islam's safety, Mliegta said he would be treated in the same way as any other detainee. National Transitional Council military liaison Abdelrahman Busin told CNN that any injuries Saif al-Islam had sustained would be treated. There was still some secrecy over his movements, Busin said, but he could guarantee Saif al-Islam's human rights would be respected if he is handed over to authorities in Tripoli. Giving his reaction to the news of the arrest, Busin said: "I think the Libyan people can finally actually breathe a big sigh, finally relax to some extent, because he has been threatening to come back with revenge for some time now. So, it's a close for many, many people." A glimpse into the Gadhafi family Once seen as a possible successor to his father and an advocate of reform, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi became a vocal defender of his father's brutal regime. His whereabouts had been unknown for months. At the end of August he made a call to Syria's Rai TV, in which he said he was speaking from a suburb of the capital, Tripoli, and urged Libyans to rise up against the rebels. Saif al-Islam, whose mother is Gadhafi's second wife, Safia, is the second-oldest son of the late strongman. He was educated at the London School of Economics and speaks fluent English.

Don't like the way airport screeners are doing their job? You might not want to complain too much while standing in line. Arrogant complaining about airport security is one indicator Transportation Security Administration officers consider when looking for possible criminals and terrorists, CNN has learned exclusively. And, when combined with other behavioral indicators, it could result in a traveler facing additional scrutiny. CNN has obtained a list of roughly 70 "behavioral indicators" that TSA behavior detection officers use to identify potentially "high risk" passengers at the nation's airports. Many of the indicators, as characterized in open government reports, are behaviors and appearances that may be indicative of stress, fear or deception. None of them, as the TSA has long said, refer to or suggest race, religion or ethnicity. But one addresses passengers' attitudes towards security, and how they express those attitudes. It reads: "Very arrogant and expresses contempt against airport passenger procedures." TSA officials declined to comment on the list of indicators, but said that no single indicator, taken by itself, is ever used to identify travelers as potentially high-risk passengers. Travelers must exhibit several indicators before behavior detection officers steer them to more thorough screening. But a civil liberties organization said the list should not include behavior relating to the expression of opinions, even arrogant expressions of opinion. "Expressing your contempt about airport procedures -- that's a First Amendment-protected right," said Michael German, a former FBI agent who now works as legal counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. "We all have the right to express our views, and particularly in a situation where the government is demanding the ability to search you." "It's circular reasoning where, you know, I'm going to ask someone to surrender their rights; if they refuse, that's evidence that I need to take their rights away from them. And it's simply inappropriate," he said. The TSA says its security programs are informed by real-world situations and intelligence. Indeed, the immigration agent who refused to let the alleged "20th hijacker" into the United States in 2001 later testified that the man's arrogant behavior contributed to his suspicions. Agent Jose Melendez-Perez told the 9/11 commission that Mohammed al-Qahtani "became visibly upset" and arrogantly pointed his finger in the agent's face when asked why he did not have an airline ticket for a return flight. But some experts say terrorists are much more likely to avoid confrontations with authorities, saying an al Qaeda training manual instructs members to blend in. "I think the idea that they would try to draw attention to themselves by being arrogant at airport security, it fails the common sense test," said CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. "And it also fails what we know about their behaviors in the past." The 9/11 commission's report says that "none of the checkpoint supervisors (on September 11th) recalled the (successful) hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening." But, it says, an airline ticket agent that checked in hijacker Mohammed Atta says Atta "reacted negatively when informed in Portland (Maine) that he would have to check in again in Boston." Atta "clenched his jaw and said ... with some irritation, 'They told me one step check-in,'" he recalled. The ticket agent recommended the United States hire "behavior profilers ... the way they do overseas," the report says. Rafi Ron, former director of security at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport, said an arrogant complaint about security is a legitimate factor to consider. But officials also should be suspicious of effusive praise, he said. "The other end of the spectrum is almost as bad, although it is maybe less offensive," he said. The TSA is expanding the behavior detection program, formally known as SPOT, for Screening Passengers by Observation Technique. Currently, some 3,000 uniformed behavior detection officers are deployed at about 175 airports. President Obama is calling for an additional 175 such officers in his 2012 budget proposal, and the TSA is expected to spend a total of $1.2 billion on the program over the next five years. In recent years, the TSA has also expanded the scope of the program. Originally intended to look only for suspected terrorists, the program now also seeks to ferret out possible criminals in airports. Many details of the program are publicly available. According to a Government Accountability Office report, uniformed behavior detection officers typically work in two-person teams at airport checkpoint lines, looking for behaviors that are on the SPOT checklist, each of which is assigned a numerical value. The officers sometimes initiate casual conversations with passengers, particularly if a passenger is exhibiting behaviors on the SPOT checklist. In most instances, the Accountability Office said, the conversation resolves the suspicion. But if both behavior detection officers agree that observed indicators exceed a predetermined numerical threshold, the person is referred to additional screening, which can involve more questioning and physical searches of a person or property. If the person's behavior escalates, accumulating more points based on the SPOT checklist, the officers can refer the person to local law enforcement for investigation. After the law enforcement investigation, the TSA officials determine whether to allow the passenger to board the flight. The Department of Homeland Security says the program is successful, telling Congress last week that, in a recent test comparing behavior detection officers to random screening procedures, the officers were 50 times more likely to refer people they checked to local law enforcement, and about 4.5 times as likely to identify people with prohibited items or fraudulent documents. Taken together, such officers are nine times more likely to identify "high risk" passengers than random screening, the department said. "SPOT identifies high-risk travelers at a significantly higher rate then random screening," Larry Willis of the department's Science and Technology Directorate testified. But one member of the study's Technical Advisory Committee said the study did not establish the program's scientific validity. "The advisory committee has not been asked to evaluate the overall SPOT program, nor has it been asked to evaluate the validity of indicators used in the program," Philip Rubin testified to Congress last week. Advisory committee members were not shown the list of behavioral indicators, he said. "My concern is that if I'm a member of the public and I hear (Willis') testimony, it sounds like the SPOT program has been validated," Rubin told CNN. He said that while large numbers of people were screened, very little criminal activity was detected, and the numbers may not be statistically significant. "The hit rate is so low on this, it could turn out to be a random glitch," he said. The Government Accountability Office also criticized the study, saying TSA's records are incomplete and the study is not designed to answer the big question people have about the program: Does it work? The study "is not designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used to reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a security risk," the agency said. Members of Congress also expressed concern about the number of "false positives" -- people flagged for additional screening that resulted in nothing being found. For every person correctly identified as a "high risk" traveler by (the behavior detection officers), 86 were misidentified, Willis said. At random screening, for every person correctly identified, 794 were misidentified. The TSA does not track the number of arrests, convictions or exonerations of people that are referred to law enforcement, he said. The ACLU's German, who has not seen the behavioral indicators list, said he fears the indicators "are being used simply as a proxy for racial profiling or other inappropriate police activities." The number of people arrested at airport checkpoints for immigration violations suggests the behavior detection officers are profiling, he said. Thirty-nine percent of the 1,083 people arrested during the first four and a half years of the program were arrested because they were illegal aliens, according to the Government Accountability Office. Experts agree that the fact that there is an extremely small number of terrorists makes it hard to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral observation programs. The Accountability Office said it looked at 23 occasions in which 16 individuals -- people later charged with terrorism-related activities -- passed through high-threat airports. None is known to have been identified. But it is not known if the behavior detection officers were working at the time, the agency said. Stephen Lord of the Accountability Office is recommending the TSA study airport videos of those instances. "We believe such recordings could help identify behaviors that may be common among terrorists, or could demonstrate that terrorists do not generally display any identifying behaviors," Lord said.
Federal safety officials want the Federal Aviation Administration to immediately ground a type of small sports aircraft, saying six of the planes have broken up in flight in the past three years, killing 10 people. The National Transportation Safety Board questions the safety of the Zodiac CH-601XL. In an urgent letter to the FAA, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board says there is "substantial circumstantial evidence" that aerodynamic "flutter" preceded some, if not all, of the fatal accidents, and that more accidents are likely to occur if action isn't taken. Flutter is a condition in which airflow around the plane causes unsafe structural vibrations. The vibrations can quickly cause the plane to break up if it is not sufficiently dampened, the safety board said. The aircraft involved is the Zodiac CH-601XL, a single-engine, two-seater that was designed by Zenair Inc. It is built by various manufacturers and also sold as a kit. In making its recommendation, the safety board said it reviewed six fatal accidents, including crashes in Spain and the Netherlands, and said flutter is the likely cause of the accidents. The board said it also considered other incidents that did not result in deaths. The NTSB said two other countries, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have grounded the aircraft. The FAA had no immediate response to the safety board's recommendation. A Zenair official did not immediately return a reporter's phone call. But the NTSB letter says Zenair contends that the flutter problem can be addressed by proper cable tension, and asserted that a November 2005 certification flight test confirmed the plane is protected from flutter. But the safety board said the type of testing used may not be adequate to uncover all susceptibility to flutter. The NTSB said the FAA certified the CH-601XL as a Special Light Sport Aircraft in 2005. This type of certification does not require that the FAA approve the airplane's design. Instead, the airplane model is issued an airworthiness certificate if the manufacturer asserts that the plane meets industry-accepted design standards and has passed a series of ground and flight tests. The safety board is asking the FAA to prohibit further flight of the Zodiac CH-601XL until the board can determine that the airplane is no longer susceptible to aerodynamic flutter. "The NTSB does not often recommend that all airplanes of a particular type be prohibited from further flight," NTSB Acting Chairman Mark V. Rosenker said in writing comments. "In this case, we believe such action will save lives. "Unless the safety issues with this particular Zodiac model are addressed, we are likely to see more accidents in which pilots and passengers are killed in airplanes that they believed were safe to fly." The safety board also found that the stick-force gradient -- a measure of the force applied to the control stick and the increase in lift that results -- was not uniform throughout the range of motion, particularly at high vertical accelerations or increased gravitational forces. The lessening of the gradient at high gravitational force could make the airplane susceptible to being inadvertently over-controlled by the pilot, which could create a condition in which the airplane is stressed beyond its design limits, leading to an in-flight structural failure.

Three men were convicted and sentenced Tuesday in Russia for masterminding and carrying out an acid attack on the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director, Sergei Filin. Star dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko was given six years in prison for masterminding the attack, while accomplice Yuri Zarutsky was sentenced to 10 years and driver Andrei Lipatov got four years, a reporter for the official Russian Legal Information Agency (RAPSI) who was in court told CNN. Prosecutors at the Moscow court had asked for Dmitrichenko to be given nine years in prison, RAPSI reported earlier. Filin was walking to his Moscow apartment in January when a masked assailant tossed sulfuric acid onto his face, leaving him severely burned and nearly blinded. He has spent much of the past year in Germany, where doctors have been working to save his sight. Curtain falls on Russian ballet director after tumultuous year The case, which has been closely watched in Russia and elsewhere, has exposed the tensions and intrigues simmering below the surface at the world-renowned ballet company. Dmitrichenko argued during his trial that he had wanted Filin to be punished in some way for failing to give him the roles he wanted; for example, by being beaten up. But, the dancer said, he did not expect Filin to be subjected to an acid attack. The power struggle tearing apart the Bolshoi In his evidence, Zarutsky told the court that the acid attack was his own idea and that he had not told Dmitrichenko about it.

BP said Wednesday that efforts to contain and clean up oil gushing from a ruptured pipe in the Gulf of Mexico have made a "measurable difference" even as Louisiana's governor announced that thick, heavy oil has begun polluting the state's wetlands and estuaries. Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, said at a news conference that the company is "very pleased" with the performance of an insertion tube that was put in place over the weekend to suck crude oil from the well and funnel it to a surface vessel. The flow rate from the tube has reached 3,000 barrels of crude (126,000 gallons) and 14 million cubic feet of gas a day, Suttles said, adding that crews hope to increase those numbers in coming days. He said favorable weather conditions have also played a major role in cleanup efforts. About 14,000 barrels of oily water was skimmed Tuesday, and 50 percent of that mixture was oil, he said, adding that crews continue to deploy boom and conduct controlled burns. But Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana says the efforts haven't stopped oil from reaching his state's coastline. Thicker, heavier oil than seen in previous days has blanketed some of the state's precious interior wetlands, he said, and he called for the Army Corps of Engineers to approve an emergency permit to dredge sand from barrier islands to create sand booms as another line of defense. "These are not tar balls, this is not sheen, this is heavy oil that we are seeing in our wetlands," Jindal said. Video from Pass a Loutre in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, showed oil with a syrupy consistency lapping against reeds in a small area of marshland after creeping past booms and barriers. "Everything that that blanket of oil has covered today will die," parish President Billy Nungesser said. "Imagine [this oil] on top of a turtle or on top of a frog," he said as he held a stalk of reed that coated his hands in oil. CNN iReporter Eileen Romero, touring the state's Chandeleur Islands by boat on Tuesday, described a "foamy sheen on top of the water" left by the oil and dispersants, and she said she counted between 10 and 15 dead Portuguese man-of-wars trapped in debris. "While we were out there, my nose and the back of my throat began to burn as I inhaled the putrid-smelling air," Romero said. Jindal compared the fight to head off the approaching oil to "knowing your body has cancer. ... We've got to stop this cancer from spreading [and] we'd much rather fight it on these coastal barrier islands than inland." "We need more than just boom or skimmers," Jinadal said. "We need multiple lines of defense." iReport: Track the spill, or share your story Meanwhile, BP said it is continuing to mobilize equipment and perform testing in preparation for the first effort to actually stop the flow of oil. Suttles said the first attempt at a "top kill" procedure could come as early as Sunday. In that procedure, a large amount of heavy "mud" -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore. If that succeeds, the well will be cemented shut, officials have said. Suttles cautioned, as he has with previous efforts, that the procedure will be performed at a depth of 5,000 feet, "which has never been done before." "We're absolutely holding out hope that top kill works," said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry. "Everybody is anxious to see success with this intervention. ... Let's keep our fingers crossed [and] let's all say our prayers." Oil has been leaking at an estimated rate of 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) a day for nearly a month after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig the Deepwater Horizon. The rig burned for two days and then sank, causing the ruptured pipe. Also Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said it has been in communication with Cuban officials over the possibility of oil reaching that country's shorelines. "The U.S. Interests Section in Havana today delivered a diplomatic note to the Cuban Foreign Ministry informing the Cuban government about the oil spill and what we currently know about its projected movement," the State Department's deputy spokesman, Mark Toner, told CNN. "We have had working level discussions with the Cuban government to keep them informed of developments." The communication came after reports of oil possibly reaching the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current. The current flows through the Yucatan Channel between Cuba and Mexico, and then northward, where it loops and exits the Gulf just south of the Florida Keys and travels to the west side of the western Bahamas. The European Space Agency issued a statement Wednesday saying satellite images show the oil is in the Loop Current. "With these images from space, we have visible proof that at least oil from the surface of the water has reached the current," Bertrand Chapron of Ifremer, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, said in the statement. Charlie Henry of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday that amounts of light sheen "are feeling the effects of the Loop Current and that oil is going to move slowly" with the current. "We actually expect that oil to dissipate," said Henry, adding it was "not an immediate threat" to Florida or other shorelines.
It was not the sort of meme Bill Cosby wanted to generate. On Monday, the comedian -- or whomever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of Cosby in a cap: "Go ahead. Meme me! #cosbymeme." The Internet immediately reacted, but probably not in the way Cosby expected. "Claire, have you seen my ... nevermind, found my raping hat!" tweeted Trill Withers over the cap picture. "My two favorite things (--) Jell-O pudding & rape," tweeted E.J. Coughlin over a photo of Cosby smiling. "Look at this wacky shirt I'm wearing (--) also I am a serial rapist," tweeted Jason Steele over a picture of a thumbs-up Cosby in a patterned shirt. By nightfall, Cosby's original tweet had been pulled from the Web, which led to this conclusion from Jensen Karp: "If anyone is looking for a job, the Social Media Manager position for @BillCosby is about to open up." But if Cosby's social media manager has gone underground, in the Internet age -- where nothing ever goes away -- the rape allegations, which Cosby has repeatedly denied, have stubbornly remained in the open. In late October, comedian Hannibal Buress bluntly attacked what he perceived as Cosby's "smuggest old black man public persona" by saying, "Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches. 'I don't curse onstage.' Well, yeah, you're (a) rapist, so I'll take you saying lots of m*****f*****s on 'Bill Cosby: Himself' if you weren't a rapist." A couple weeks later, Cosby was booked on Queen Latifah's talk show, but the allegations reportedly gave the staff "cold feet," according to TMZ. Cosby's booking was "postponed at his request," the website reported in an addendum. (Cosby did do interviews with Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon without incident.) Now comes the social media fiasco. For years, Cosby has denied the rape allegations. In February, after Newsweek ran an interview with one of the purported victims, Tamara Green, Cosby's representative said, "This is a 10-year-old, discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing." Nine years ago, when Green was interviewed by Matt Lauer on the "Today" show, his lawyer issued a statement: "Miss Green's allegations are absolutely false. Mr. Cosby does not know the name Tamara Green or (maiden name) Tamara Lucier and the incident she describes did not happen. The fact that she may have repeated this story to others is not corroboration." In the case of Andrea Constand, who sued Cosby in 2005 over an incident the year before, Cosby says the sex was consensual. CNN has reached out to Cosby's representative for comment on this story, but has yet to hear back. Lawsuit airs allegations At the time of Constand's lawsuit, Cosby had been in the news for a sexual affair once before. In 1997, a woman named Autumn Jackson claimed to be Cosby's love child. Cosby admitted to a relationship with Jackson's mother but denied paternity. Jackson was later convicted of extortion. However, it wasn't until Constand's lawsuit in 2005 that the comedian was accused of rape. Constand, a staffer for Temple University's women's basketball team, said in her suit that Cosby -- a Temple alum -- had become a mentor to her in the months since they met in 2002. In early 2004, he invited her to his house in suburban Philadelphia. Constand told Cosby she was feeling stressed and Cosby gave her three blue pills, which he described as "herbal medication," according to her suit, which was posted on The Smoking Gun. Then, her "knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious," the suit continued. Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested. "When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray," the suit said. Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but at the end of February declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. Cosby's lawyer, Walter M. Phillips Jr., told CNN the allegations were "utterly preposterous" and "plainly bizarre," but Cosby later acknowledged his role in the situation. "Looking back on it, I realize that words and actions can be misinterpreted by another person, and unless you're a supreme being, you can't predict what another individual will do," he told the National Enquirer in March 2005. "I'm not saying that what I did was wrong, but I apologize to my loving wife, who has stood by my side for all these years, for any pain I have caused her. These allegations have caused my family great emotional stress." Constand filed her civil suit in March 2005. Constand's lawyers said they found 13 Jane Doe witnesses with similar stories. However, Constand's suit was settled in November 2006, and the witnesses were never called. Terms have not been disclosed. Tarnished reputation As Mark Whitaker's recent Cosby biography makes clear, the man has his demons. He had affairs while on the road and there have been bumps in his long marriage to his wife, Camille. The influence of Bill Cosby But Whitaker, a former CNN managing editor, told CNN that he didn't feel comfortable airing the rape allegations. "Basically, I knew that I was going to have to be very careful in what I said about his private life. I felt that way as a journalist and also for legal reasons," he said in an interview about the biography. "In the case of these other allegations, basically because there were no definitive court findings, no independent witnesses, it didn't meet my standard for what I was going to put in the book." "I also was very aware that if I just did a she said-he said, and I printed allegations and denials without my own independent reporting, first of all it's not really in the spirit in the book, but also every person who then reviewed or reported on the book would be free to repeat those unconfirmed allegations just because they were in my book. And I just didn't feel comfortable being responsible for that." Still, the rape allegations are always just a mouse click away. Not long after Constand's accusations hit the media, Tamara Green went public with her claims on "Today." A few months later, another Jane Doe, Beth Ferrier, also spoke out. A third woman, Barbara Bowman, came forward in 2006. Green and Bowman both gave interviews to Newsweek in early 2014. How all the controversy has affected Cosby personally is unknown. He's still scheduled to star in an NBC sitcom next year, and his skills as a comedian appear undiminished. Last year's concert movie, "Far From Finished," earned mostly positive reviews, and his recent comedy tour has also received praise. On Saturday night, he appeared at the New York Comedy Festival and played to an appreciative crowd. "Over the course of a non-stop two hours, he proves himself yet again to be an extraordinarily skilled storyteller, a performer who is acutely aware of his audience and in full of control of the room from start to finish," wrote the Guardian's Elise Czajkowski. But his once-sterling reputation has taken a hit. The Washington Post, Salon and The New York Times have all mentioned the rape allegations in stories, criticizing Cosby to varying degrees. And comedian Buress, who later talked about the Cosby allegations on Howard Stern's radio show, said at a St. Louis show that he had asked fellow comedian Dave Chappelle for advice. Chappelle told Buress to talk to Cosby, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. But then Chappelle watched the Buress video. Maybe it's not a good idea after all, he said.
In the wake of another round of national protests against police killings of unarmed black men, many Republicans seem unable to identify with protesters or give credence to the goals of the #ICantBreathe movement. I empathize with the vast majority of cops who keep the peace on our streets and enjoy majority support from their communities across the country. These protests aren't about them. These protests are about citizens' rattled faith in the fair delivery of justice. In any civil society, there's a serious problem when confidence in the rule of law is shaken. Republicans who are committed to the stability of our society must acknowledge that these protests reflect real doubts in the equity of our criminal justice system. We all have a moral obligation to constantly improve it to the benefit of everyone. Whether you agree that the decision not to indict former Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown was correct (as I do), or if you think the slogan "hands up don't shoot" has been discredited because of witness testimony from the grand jury (I do), Republicans ought to accept that there's a broader problem. Look at the case of Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, or Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, and at least a half dozen others. As a reform Republican who works for the GOP to broaden its base and reach new constituencies, I see no contradiction between supporting law enforcement and the policy solutions highlighted by these protestors. More Republicans should champion the implementation of body-worn cameras on police officers, requested by Michael Brown's family and supported by Republican law enforcement proponent Rudy Giuliani. According to one study, body-worn cameras yielded a 50% reduction in use-of-force incidents, and complaints against police officers dropped precipitously. We should be advocating these technologies to help protect the innocent and convict the guilty. Consider that if Wilson had worn a camera, there could be remarkably less dispute over the details of that tragedy. Republicans should also champion "community policing" practices such as those employed by Camden, New Jersey, Police Chief Scott Thomson where creative engagement with community partners has reduced homicides by 50% and violent crime by 20%. Pragmatic and nonpartisan solutions will increase confidence in law enforcement and support good police while offering more transparency and accountability to citizens who have lost confidence in the justice system. Among the 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls, Sen. Rand Paul stands out on the issue of criminal justice reform because he's consistently reached out beyond the base to communities of color. More Republicans should follow his lead on policies ranging from reforming mandatory minimum sentencing and giving felons who have already served time the right to vote. On a recent Saturday afternoon, I co-hosted an opinion panel on CNN with my friends Sally Kohn, Sunny Hostin and Mel Robbins. While we usually represent contrasting perspectives on the week's top issues, we strive to disagree agreeably and forge common ground. That was the case this past weekend, when we jointly agreed to end the show with a salute to the ongoing #ICantBreathe protests. The photo of us four raising our hands was celebrated on social media by creative icons such as Shonda Rhimes, who tweeted, "Inspired to see @CNN opinion voices speaking out on left and right," and Russell Simmons, "Glad to see diverse and bold voices on @cnn. Beautiful statement of support for humanity." It was also condemned by conservatives who wondered why I, as a Republican, was supporting a discredited narrative. First of all, facts matter. I've made my support for the grand jury's nonincitement in the Ferguson case clear. But right or wrong, "hands up" has now fused with a larger movement -- bigger than Darren Wilson and Michael Brown. I believe we all have an obligation, especially Republicans, to engage the debate and propose solutions for improving our criminal justice system. CNN is and always should be the place that breaks through left/right, black/white divides and forges common ground on contentious debates. That's what we aspire to in our opinion panel. Our common ground broke through the tired divisions that too often dominate cable TV debates -- it sparked attention for the right reasons. It should be the beginning of a refreshing conversation about how we can come together and improve our criminal justice system.
At least 12 Chinese sailors have been killed after their cargo ships were attacked on the Mekong River in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai, the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Yunnan Province has said. The ministry's website stated that two Chinese cargo ships -- the Hua Ping and Yu Xing 8 -- were attacked with gunfire on October 5. According to the initial investigation, all six sailors from Hua Ping and six of the seven sailors from Yu Xing 8 were found dead, while one remained missing. Though still in the early stages of their investigation, Thai police say they cannot rule out the involvement of drug gangs in the killings. Chiang Rai police colonel Popkorn Khuncharoensuk told CNN that the two ships were raided by a joint task force of army, marine police, local police and paramilitary following the attack, and found almost one million amphetamines on the vessels. "This is the most gruesome incident I have ever seen," Popkorn said. According to Popkorn, one of the bodies was found aboard the Hua Ping, while the rest were found in the Mekong River near Chiangsaen port. Three of the bodies remained unidentified, and some were found with their hands cuffed or tied. "I can't rule out all possibilities, but initially there appears to be drugs involved," Popkorn said. "But we can't just quickly jump to the conclusion that it was carried out by drug gangs. The case is complicated, and we have to be very thorough." The violent incident has unnerved many of those who ply their trade on the river. "There are no cargo ships leaving or coming to Chiangsaen port," said Surachart Janthawatcharakorn, Chief of Chiangsaen Customs Office. "They have all halted their traveling because they are still frightened by the incident, and are still very concerned about their safety." The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and its consulate general in Chiang Mai were investigating the murders and were working closely with Thai authorities and other relevant countries to hunt down the criminals. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Haolan Hong contributed to this report.
China has banned dishes containing delicacies like shark fin and and bird's nest from official banquets as part of a government crackdown on official extravagance. Chinese authorities published new regulations that "explicitly ruled out dishes containing shark fins, bird nests and wild animal products in official reception dinners," the official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. Xinhua also said that cigarettes and up-market liquors are not allowed to be served at official dinners and officials below provincial level should not stay in hotel suites on business trips. The new rules aim to "regulate the use of public funding on receptions," Xinhua added. President Xi Jinping has made tackling official corruption a priority since taking power earlier this year. In September, the government announced that officials would not be able to use public money to send mooncakes as gifts - a traditional part of China's Mid Autumn Festival celebrations. Some hotels in Hong Kong and China have also removed shark's fin soup from their menus and airlines like, Cathay Pacific, have banned the product from cargo holds. Up to 73 million sharks are estimated to be killed each year, according to a 2006 academic study quoted on the website of campaign group Hong Kong Shark Foundation. Their carcasses are usually discarded and campaigners say the practice is wasteful and cruel. Shark's fin soup is widely served in restaurants in Chinese communities worldwide and is a dish often served at weddings to mark the importance of the occasion and impress the couple's extended families and friends.

Nigeria postponed its parliamentary election Saturday due to a "terrible unfortunate emergency" caused by the late arrival of voting materials, the head of the election commission said. Nigerians will instead go to the polls Monday, said Attahiru Jega, chairman of the Independent National Election Commission. "We cannot proceed with these elections if we want them to be free, fair and credible if there are no result sheets," Jega said. "We cannot bury our heads and say there are no problems. It is regrettable. It is unfortunate. It should not have happened." Jega said he takes full responsibility for the fiasco but he said a vendor that was supplying results sheets and ballots was unable to deliver them on time. The vendor, said Jega, cited the diversion of planes to carry relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Japan as the reason for the delay. Citizens of Africa's most populous nation were supposed to vote Saturday for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. They are scheduled to vote next Saturday in a presidential election and for state governors the following week. Before the logistical problems, the election, the most expensive in Nigeria's history, had already been marred by riots, bombings and assassinations. "The unprecedented levels of violence that have seen several people either killed, maimed, kidnapped or intimidated for political reasons pose the single most significant threat to the conduct of general elections," warned the Nigeria Elections Situation Room -- a forum of groups focusing on the upcoming elections. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 70 people have been killed in political violence in the run-up to the voting. The European Union described Nigeria's 2007 elections as the worst they had ever seen anywhere in the world, with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigeria had hoped to gain a cleaner image this year. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.
Manila's international airport is on high alert after authorities foiled an alleged bomb plot Monday, state-run media in the Philippines report. Counter-terror agents acting on a tip interrupted a group of men allegedly assembling improvised explosive devices in a white truck parked outside a terminal at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, said the Philippines News Agency, or PNA. The agency initially said four suspects had been arrested but later revised the number of arrests to three. The white truck had been parked outside terminal three of the airport when it was intercepted about 1:45 a.m. local time (1:45 p.m. Sunday ET), PNA said. The agents from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation also seized firearms from the men, it said. The names of the suspects have not yet been released, and investigators are trying to establish who was behind the alleged plot and their motive. The investigation is continuing. Rebel groups in the Philippines have been fighting to establish an independent Muslim homeland in the south of the predominantly Christian country.
The U.N. Security Council approved sanctions Thursday against Nigeria's Boko Haram. It added the terrorist group to the United Nation's 1267 sanctions list, a list of al Qaeda-linked organizations subject to arms embargoes, travel bans and asset freezes. "Today, the Security Council took an important step in support of the government of Nigeria's efforts to defeat Boko Haram and hold its murderous leadership accountable for atrocities," said Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. "By adding Boko Haram to the U.N.'s 1267 sanctions list, the Security Council has helped to close off important avenues of funding, travel and weapons to Boko Haram, and shown global unity against their savage actions," she added. Nigeria had asked the United Nations to make the move as attacks in Africa's most populous nation appear to be escalating, spreading beyond Boko Haram's hotbed in the rural northeast. Twin blasts killed at least 118 people Tuesday at a market in the central city of Jos. The explosions went off 20 to 30 minutes apart, sparking an inferno that sent crowds running and screaming, covered in blood. Nigerian authorities described the blasts as "terrorist activities" but declined to speculate on who might be responsible. In separate attacks in Borno state this week, at least 30 people were killed by members of the terror group, according to local residents. Boko Haram attackers swooped in on motorcycles Monday and killed 10 people in one village, residents said. A day later, gunmen stormed a nearby village and killed 20 others, residents said. During the attacks, Boko Haram set fire to homes and food stores, residents said, and fired machine guns. The group has not claimed responsibility for those attacks. Both villages are close to where more than 200 girls were kidnapped from a school last month. A Boko Haram leader claimed responsibility in a chilling video and said he was willing to free the girls in exchange for imprisoned militants. "The sanctions designation is the latest step in the international community's long-term effort to help Nigeria counter this terrorist threat," Power said. "We will continue doing everything we can to help the people of Nigeria bring back their girls, and we will work with the government of Nigeria to eliminate Boko Haram, including refuting their backwards and bloodthirsty ideology, because no child anywhere should ever be afraid to pursue a brighter future." CNN's Richard Roth, Nana Karikari-apau, Faith Karimi and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.
One of the men accused of gang raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus was found dead in his jail cell Monday. Police say Ram Singh hanged himself. But his lawyer and parents claim he was murdered. "There was no reason for him to commit suicide. There is some foul play," Singh's attorney V.K. Anand said. Singh was housed in New Delhi's Tihar Prison. Last year, the prison recorded 18 deaths, including two suicides, according to CNN affiliate CNN-IBN. "Ram Singh did not kill himself. He was murdered," Singh's father, Mangi Lai, told the affiliate. New Delhi's Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said she has ordered an inquiry. Authorties say Singh was the driver of the bus aboard which several men brutally raped a 23-year-old woman on December 16. The gang rape, and the woman's subsequent death from injuries, prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. Police charged Singh and four other men with murder, rape and kidnapping. Their trial began in February. If convicted, the men could face the death penalty. A sixth suspect is 17 and will be tried separately in juvenile court. The December rape gripped India and led to calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women. Most Indian women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.
Vivienne Westwood is as bald as a baby, the faintest hint of downy white hair sprouting across her naked scalp. Painted pink eyebrows sweep dramatically outwards. Wearing a sparkling, woven brown dress resembling an expensive hessian sack, she totters onto the stage at London's Southbank arts centre. Straining forward in her chair, the 72-year-old "grandmother of punk fashion" appears both vulnerable and fierce. Fragile and yet fearless. "The world was so mismanaged and we hated the older generation because they weren't doing anything about it," she says about forging Britain's punk aesthetic with then-boyfriend and Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren in the 1970s. "I don't hate the older people now -- I'm one of them. But I've been trying to do something to change things all my life." 'God Save the Queen' Decades after the couple started their radical new clothes shop in an area of London called "World's End" -- displaying ripped t-shirts, rubber curtains, and even a live rat in a cage -- Westwood has become one of Britain's most prestigious fashion designers. This is the woman who, after receiving an award from Queen Elizabeth II in 1992, famously twirled around for photographers -- without wearing any underwear under her skirt. The provocative lady is still there, though a little more frail-looking these days, speaking at London's annual Women of the World Festival. "Buy less, choose well, make it last," she tells a crowd of hundreds -- mostly women -- patiently listening to a lecture that meanders into climate change, banks, and social responsibility. Campaign culture Westwood appears almost reluctant to talk about the "superficial" fashion industry she has conquered in a career spanning four decades. "We face mass extinction," she says. "It's being hidden from us because our rulers still pursue their own vested interest, they've been trained to think that the people do not understand what's good for them." Her trademark head of fiery red hair has been shaved off, not for style -- but to draw attention to climate change. Westwood says she now plans to downsize her hugely successful clothing empire, in a bid to promote environmental sustainability. "I've got too much product," she says. "I'm trying to completely reduce the scale of operation. I'm concentrating on quality, not quantity." What about those people who can't afford her designer clothes? "It is difficult for people. But I think it's not good to just go to a supermarket and come back with bags and bags of cheap t-shirts." "All this consumption is not a real choice." Made in Britain Born in Derbyshire, in north west England, during World War Two, Westwood's mother was a weaver in a cotton mill, while her father came from a family of shoemakers. As a teenager in the 1950s, she would alter her school uniform into fashionable pencil skirts. Later, she worked as a teacher. But it was through meeting Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren in the 1960s -- who became the father of her son Joseph Ferdinand CorrÃ© in 1966 -- that she really embraced punk rock. The couple's south west London shop -- which at various times was named "Let it Rock," "Sex," and "Seditionaries - Clothes for Heroes" -- sold everything from rubber fetish gear to pirate outfits. "The country was a morass of beige and cream Bri-Nylon and their shop was an oasis," said Marco Pirroni of band Adam and the Ants. "It took great liberalism and bravery to wear rubber in the street. If you shopped there, you didn't go anywhere else." Noughties Westwood Cast your eye across the most glamorous red carpet events in the world today and you'll likely to see a Westwood design -- be it Lily Allen's princess dress at the BAFTAs or Pharrell Williams' cowboy hat at the Oscars. Regardless of her huge success, Westwood still talks of fighting the establishment. "I used my fashion as a platform to talk politics," she says. "When you're a fashion designer you sort of design in a capsule. This is how you want people to be, like they are at the moment, but better."
Spain's football duopoly of Real Madrid and Barcelona has become so dominant that sponsors have lost interest in backing other Spanish clubs. "Having two monsters like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, the world's leading concert in football, overshadows the other clubs," financial expert Jose Maria Gay de Liebana told CNN. "Sports sponsorship companies are more inclined to be the third or fourth sponsor of these two great clubs, Barcelona and Madrid, rather than be the first sponsor of a club without universal screening," he added. Gay de Liebana told CNN that the apparent advantage of having global brands in the top tier of Spanish football -- known as La Liga -- is in fact a serious detriment to many clubs. According to Forbes Magazine's 2012 rankings, Real Madrid is the richest club in the world by revenue -- $695 million -- and second only to Manchester United in market value. Burden Meanwhile, Barcelona -- widely recognized as the best football team in the world with a pedigree of stars such as Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta -- is the second richest club in the world by revenue. Gay de Liebana says the presence of these two football behemoths combined with billions of euros of debt - estimated at $4.5 billion for Primera Division teams -- and liabilities has meant Spanish football clubs can no longer cope with this burden. Traditionally local governments in Spain have had a role to play in the financial management of football clubs. In the past, teams such as Valencia and Madrid, as sporting institutions, have received subsidies from local authorities, according to Spanish football expert Sid Lowe. But in the current economic climate, state investment in football clubs is not a high priority for many politicians as the central government in Madrid grapples with a spiralling national debt and chronic unemployment of over 25%. Spain -- the eurozone's fourth largest economy -- is likely to be the next bailout casualty of the debt crisis in the 17-nation currency union. The government in Madrid has already requested a rescue package for its ailing banks, which require almost 60 billion euros ($76.4 million) in support following an audit in September. Real Oviedo's plea Further down the feeding chain of Spanish football the financial situation is even more dire -- so much so that one Spanish club in the third division -- Real Oviedo -- has turned to football fans for help. Earlier this month the Asturias-based team launched a campaign, whereby fans could effectively buy shares at approximately 11 euros [$13] each in exchange for a token stake in the club. Word of Real Oviedo's plight went viral on Twitter and football fans across the globe responded by purchasing shares and raising more than one million euros ($1.2 million) in nine days. Gay de Liebana argued that the current state of Spanish football clubs is the result of poor financial regulation and supervision. When asked whether other teams might also stand on the precipice of extinction, he said: "I absolutely know it will happen... The next few months -- and I hope I am wrong -- will be tragic for some clubs."
David Beckham is planning showdown talks with L.A. Galaxy teammate Landon Donovan, who questioned the English football star's commitment to the MLS team earlier this month. Landon Donovan, left, is unhappy with David Beckham's contribution at LA Galaxy. Beckham said the U.S. national captain was "unprofessional" for publicly voicing his opinions, which were reported worldwide from the soon-to-be-published book "The Beckham Experiment" by Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl. "In every football player's eyes throughout the world, it would be unprofessional to speak out about a team-mate, especially in the press and not to your face," Beckham said before watching the Galaxy's 1-0 win over Chivas USA on Saturday night. What do you think? Was Donovan right? "In 17 years, I have played with the biggest teams in the world and the biggest players, and not once have I been criticized for my professionalism. "It's important to get this cleared up, and I will be speaking to Landon either this evening or over the next couple of days. Me and Landon will talk, but that will be a private conversation." Donovan, who led the United States to the Confederations Cup final last month, said in the book that Beckham had been a negative influence since his high-profile move to the Major League Soccer outfit two years ago. He said Beckham, who brokered a loan move to AC Milan last season, had shown little interest in the Galaxy since coach Ruud Gullit resigned in August last year. Donovan, who leads the Galaxy in Beckham's absence, also cast doubt on the 34-year-old midfielder's leadership abilities. But last week he admitted that he should have brought up his grievances with Beckham earlier. "I don't apologize for what I said," Donovan told MLSnet.com on Thursday. "I just apologize for the way I did. I should have told him to his face. I've long told David since he's been gone and I've been gone that I want to sit down and talk with him about everything. "It's fresh in everyone's minds now, and it appears like everything has gone on in a short period of time, but this has been a long time coming. The timing of it makes it a little awkward and seemingly uncomfortable, but we'll be fine. We'll get through it. "I like David as a person and I think he's a very good player. The frustrating part was at some point something happened and he seemingly turned off at the end of the year. "Nobody knows what it was, and my fault is I should have asked him and approached him and I didn't. Instead I vented to a reporter, and I regret it."
eight of them children -- were killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. In the chaos, they were rushed to nearby Shifa Hospital. A TV news outlet run by Hamas showed live footage of the hospital. The channel blamed the carnage on an Israeli drone. Shifa Hospital had been hit, too. Two people there were injured, the ministry said. As before, Israel and Hamas accused each other of sending the bombs that killed people in Gaza. A short time later, Israel sent a text message to the media blaming Gaza "terrorists" for the attacks. "In the blink of an eye," a father said, "I found body parts and heads cut off, no arms, no legs. I started to collect limbs, heads I couldn't recognize, I couldn't recognize my own children." Though world leaders pleaded for a humanitarian cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a message on Israeli television Monday. "We need to be prepared for a protracted campaign in Gaza," he said. Calling life under the threat of death "inconceivable" for Israel, Netanyahu said the military will not end its incursion into Gaza until it has destroyed tunnels Hamas is using to attack civilians outside Gaza. Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said Israel will not negotiate while Hamas is still attacking. "We will not hesitate to expand our operation," he said. Deaths in Israel, too Ten Israeli soldiers were killed Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Five were killed fighting militants who tried to attack Israeli civilians using a tunnel shaft leading to the Nahal Oz community, the IDF said. Israeli soldiers stopped the attempted attack, killing one of the attackers, the military said. One Israeli soldier died in combat in southern Gaza. And another four were killed and eight were injured by mortar fire near Beeri, close to the Israeli-Gaza border, the IDF said. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for Gaza health ministry, said 1,101 people have been killed and more than 6,500 wounded in Gaza since the current conflict began. A total of 53 Israeli soldiers have died. The tunnels A central goal of Israel's military is to destroy tunnels that Hamas uses to smuggle weapons and launch attacks. CNN's "New Day" asked chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat what the purpose of the tunnels were. "I know the situation is so much complex -- I'm not saying I know the picture as a whole," he responded. But, he said, Gaza is now like a burning building. "We need to get the people out, and then we need to extinguish the fire, and then we sit down and talk." Erakat called for Israel to pull troops out of Gaza. Israel isn't acting in self-defense, he said. "They're the occupying power. They should be responsible for the human lives there." Erakat said U.N. figures show "90% of those killed are women and children." It was unclear what he was basing those figures on. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% of the Palestinians killed were civilians, including 226  youths and 117  women. More than 150 were members of armed groups, the United Nations says. UNICEF said Monday that about two-thirds of the children killed were 12 or younger. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying militants encourage people to stay in their homes despite Israeli warnings that strikes are coming. Militants also use civilian facilities such as homes, schools, mosques and hospitals to launch attacks on Israeli civilians and store weapons. Calls, hopes for peace The Gaza crisis was discussed Monday in a joint call involving U.S. President Barack Obama. British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela  Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. A statement from Cameron's office said the leaders agreed on "the urgent need for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and Israel, backing the efforts of the Egyptian government to achieve this." U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry returned to Washington after a trip to the Middle East and Paris, where he held discussions in an attempt to calm the violence. His efforts were criticized by Israeli media and Palestinian leaders. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday night that he was concerned the IDF had dropped leaflets in the northern Gaza Strip,  warning thousands of residents to leave their homes and evacuate to Gaza City. If true, this would have a "devastating humanitarian impact" on Gaza residents, he said. At a midnight meeting, the U.N. Security Council proclaimed its support for "a comprehensive peace based on the vision of a region where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders as envisioned in Security Council resolution 1850 (2008)." That fell short of Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour's desires. He wanted the body to pass a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. "The equation is simple," Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor said. "When it is quiet in Israel, it will be quiet in Gaza." Obama had another phone conversation with Netanyahu on Sunday, reiterating concern about the rising Palestinian civilian deaths, Israeli deaths and the "worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza." Israel: We're not responsible for last week's school deaths The Israeli military said it was not responsible for anyone killed last week when an "errant Israeli mortar" hit the courtyard of a U.N. school that was shelter to many Gaza residents. U.N. and Palestinian officials said 16 people were killed and hundreds were wounded Thursday when the school in northern Gaza was struck. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said militants had fired anti-tank missiles from the immediate area of the school, and the IDF fired several mortar shells back in that direction. "A single errant Israeli mortar landed in the courtyard in the school," Lerner said. "The footage we have shows the courtyard was empty." "We reject the claim that people were killed by the IDF mortar on the school premises," he added. But Lerner said there could have been people who were wounded by shrapnel. Israeli government spokesman, Mark Regev said, "The question is who is responsible, and for that we have to look at seriously and judiciously and make sure we get to the truth." A CNN team that visited the shelter several hours after the mortar attack saw evidence that people were badly wounded at the courtyard. The team saw blood and strewn possessions concentrated close to the edge of the courtyard along the wall of the building, the area that would have been shady around 3 p.m. when the school was hit. The IDF released a high-altitude aerial video of the round hitting the school, but it did not have high resolution and it is impossible to tell if anybody was sitting on the courtyard edge.

Evangelist Tony Alamo is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison after an Arkansas judge sentenced him to 175 years Friday on charges that included taking minors across state lines for sex, according to prosecutors. A jury convicted Alamo in July on 10 federal counts covering offenses that spanned 11 years and dated back to 1994, according to documents from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. Alamo, the 75-year-old founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries, will serve the sentences on each count consecutively, for a total of 175 years in prison, prosecutors said. In addition to his sentence, Alamo was fined $250,000, court documents showed. His lawyer filed an appeal Friday. Christopher Plumlee, assistant U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, welcomed the sentence. "Given the number of victims and the difficult type of testimony they had to provide in order to get to trial, it's gratifying for them to see him get this sentence," he said. "Not only did they entrust their lives to him, he did it in the name of God. And he betrayed their trust." Authorities in September 2008 arrested Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Hoffman, and raided his 15-acre compound near Texarkana, Arkansas. An indictment released in November 2008 accused Alamo of transporting five girls across state lines for sex. The criminal complaint included accounts from three girls, two of whom were 17 when the complaint was released last year, and one who was 14. All three said Alamo sexually abused them. In a phone interview last year with CNN, Alamo called the accusations a hoax. "They're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I'm a pornographer. Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will."
Cholera is an intestinal infection that's rare in the United States currently. But in the developing world it's a serious problem, with 3 to 5 million cases every year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The disease brings on diarrhea, which can kill a person if he or she is not properly hydrated. A tremendous advance in hydration was invented by David Nalin, along with his colleague Richard Cash. Nalin was working in Bangladesh during a cholera epidemic in 1968, when intravenous solutions were the only treatment. He knew that an oral method of rehydration would be much more accessible and cost-effective for the people who needed it most. This idea had been around before. Other doctors had tried oral methods but failed because they had the wrong proportions, and because they were focused on trying to give every person the same "magic bullet" dosage of therapy. Nalin recognized that the volume of oral rehydration therapy required isn't the same for every patient. Individual losses need to be replaced with equal volumes of the absorbable solution. What exactly did he deliver to patients? Essentially, a mixture of salt, water and sugar in the right proportions. This simple idea has saved millions of lives -- not just from cholera, but from any diarrhea. The Lancet, a prestigious British medical journal, called this "potentially the most important medical advance of this century." "The devastating conditions suffered by the Bangladeshi refugees as they fled the war with Pakistan offered ORT (oral rehydration therapy) its definitive test," according to an August 2003 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. "When the medical team ran out of intravenous fluids at the camp, oral glucose-salt packets were used to treat (more than) 3,000 patients, resulting in a reduction in the mortality rate from 30% to only 3.6%," the journal said. CNN's Edythe McNamee contributed to this report.
On the sweltering evening of April 12, 2009, as dusk deepened over the Indian Ocean, several hundred miles off the coast of Somalia, three shots rang out. All the bullets found their targets -- three Somali pirates in a small lifeboat bobbing on the darkening sea. For the past five days the pirates had taken hostage Richard Phillips, the American captain of the Maersk Alabama container ship. President Barack Obama had authorized the use of deadly force if Phillips' life was in danger. Unbeknownst to the pirates, days earlier a contingent from SEAL Team 6 had parachuted at night into the ocean near the USS Bainbridge warship, which was shadowing the pirates in their boat. The SEALs had taken up position on the fantail of the Bainbridge and were carefully monitoring Phillips while he was in the custody of the pirates. One of the pirates had just pointed his AK-47 at the American captain as if he were going to shoot him. That's when the SEAL team commander on the Bainbridge ordered his men to take out the pirates. U.S. terror raids: 2 operations. 2 outcomes. 5 questions Three U.S. Navy SEAL sharpshooters fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall, killing them all. Obama called Vice Adm. William "Bill" McRaven, the leader of Joint Special Operations Command and of the mission to rescue Phillips, to tell him, "Great job." In the eyes of Hollywood at least, the American public can't get enough of these kinds of operations. "Captain Phillips," a movie starring Tom Hanks playing the rescued sea captain, will be in theaters on Friday. The flawless rescue of Philips was the first time that Obama, only three months into his new job, was personally exposed to the capabilities of America's "Quiet Professionals," as they sometimes refer to themselves. They are the secretive counterterrorism units of special operations, made up of units including the Navy's SEAL Team 6 and the Army's Delta Force, whose well-oiled skills Obama has come to rely upon increasingly with every passing year of his presidency. African raids This was underlined over the weekend in Africa when operators from Delta and SEAL Team 6 carried out raids in Libya and Somalia -- more than 2,000 miles apart -- targeting a longtime alleged member of al Qaeda in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and the leaders of one al Qaeda's affiliated groups in the Somali port of Barawe. In Tripoli, Delta operators seized Abu Anas al-Libi, who is wanted for his alleged role performing surveillance on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, which was destroyed by an al Qaeda truck bomb in 1998, while in Barawe SEAL Team 6 operators went ashore to attack a house frequented by commanders of Al Shabaab, the group that launched the attack on the mall in Nairobi two weeks ago where at least 67 people were killed. The Delta raid in Tripoli went off flawlessly, but the SEALs encountered heavy resistance in Barawe and the SEAL team retreated. Details of what exactly happened during the Somali operation are still murky. The two raids over the weekend show that President Obama remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the United States is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups, just as he is comfortable with the use of CIA drones for the same purpose in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen. For the White House, part of the appeal of special operations and drones is that they do not, of course, consume anything like the blood and treasure that are expended on conventional military operations such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, the SEALS have had considerable experience working in and around Somalia in recent years. Six months after the rescue of Phillips, Obama's national security team authorized a mission to take out Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a leader of al Qaeda in Africa. Nabhan was killed by SEAL Team 6 in a helicopter raid on September 14, 2009, as he was driving south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. The SEALs landed briefly to take Nabhan's body, and after they had confirmed his identity through DNA samples, he was buried at sea. U.S. official: Raid's target was Al-Shabaab foreign fighter commander Home of SEAL Team 6 It is quite challenging to enter the SEALs, but an even greater challenge is to be selected for the SEAL's premier counterterrorism force, the innocuously named Naval Special Warfare Development Group based at Dam Neck, Virginia, near the bustling resort town of Virginia Beach. It's known inside the military as "DevGru" and more popularly as "SEAL Team 6" and is an elite within the SEAL elite. The men of DevGru, around 250 in total, are battle-hardened and are usually in their mid-30s. DevGru is divided into squadrons that are named by color: Red, Blue and Gold are the assault squadrons, Grey handles vehicles and boats, and Black is the sniper team. These squadrons scout other SEAL teams, which number around 2,000 men, for those with the particular skills they need. DevGru's base at Dam Neck does not announce itself. Behind the high wire fence that seals the SEALs off from the rest of the world is a large dog pound where the highly trained dogs that accompany the men on their missions live. There is a giant wall to sharpen climbing skills and a hangar full of exceptionally fast boats. Other hangars house experimental Mad Max-like dune buggies suitable for driving in the deserts of the Middle East and weapons rooms loaded with exotic firearms. 'Somalia-ized' SEAL Team 6's greatest coup, of course, was the 2011 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which Osama bin Laden was killed. However, SEAL Team 6's integral role in the war against al Qaeda and its allies would not have been easy to predict before the 9/11 attacks. Just recall the debacle that has come to be known as "Blackhawk Down." In Mogadishu, Somalia, in early October 1993 a daytime helicopter assault -- by pilots of the Special Operations Air Regiment and elements of SEAL Team 6, Delta Force and the 75th Rangers -- to snatch Somali clan leaders who were attacking U.S. troops stationed in Somalia turned into a fiasco in which two Blackhawk helicopters were shot down by rocket propelled grenades. Eighteen American servicemen died. Scarred by Mogadishu, the Pentagon was resistant to using SEAL Team 6 and Delta to take on al Qaeda in Afghanistan once the terrorist group had rebased itself there in 1996. Indeed, after the 9/11 attacks, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was deeply frustrated that the first American boots on the ground in Afghanistan were from the CIA and not the highly trained counterterrorism units of SEAL Team 6 and Delta Force. On October 17, 2001, ten days after the U.S. campaign against the Taliban had started, Rumsfeld wrote a secret memo to Gen. Richard Myers, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressing his irritation: "Does the fact that the Defense Department can't do anything on the ground in Afghanistan until CIA people go in first to prepare the way suggest that the Defense Department is lacking a capability we need? Specifically, given the nature of our world, isn't it conceivable that the Department (of Defense) ought not to be in a position of near total dependence on CIA in situations such as this?" Officials working for Rumsfeld commissioned Richard Shultz, an historian on special forces, to find out why special operations units were not deployed to hit al-Qaeda before the attacks on New York and Washington. After all, fighting terrorists was why these units were founded in the first place. Schultz concluded that in the years before 9/11 the senior officers at the Pentagon had become "Somalia-ized." Then-special operations boss Gen. Peter Schoomaker recalled, "Special operations were never given the mission. It was very, very frustrating. It was like having a brand-new Ferrari in the garage and nobody wants to race it because you might dent the fender." The attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon allowed Rumsfeld to push special operations to the center of the "Global War on Terrorism." And on September 6, 2003, Rumsfeld signed an order known as an "EXORD" that empowered Joint Special Operations Command to hunt al-Qaeda in as many as 15 countries. Wife: Captured 'most wanted terrorist' al Libi had left al Qaeda Military's own army In the decade after 9/11, JSOC became a small army within the military with its own drones, its own air force (known as the Confederate Air Force) and its own intelligence operations. The rise of JSOC was inextricably linked to the vision of Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a brilliant workaholic from a military family who was beloved by his men; during the Iraq War he who would go out with them on missions to capture/kill insurgents. It was McChrystal who took the special operations Ferrari out of the garage and drove it to become a killing machine of unprecedented agility and ferocity. JSOC went from mounting half a dozen operations a month in Iraq in the spring of 2004 to 300 a month by the summer of 2006. It was McChrystal's five-year command of JSOC between 2003 and 2008 that helped turn its core components of SEAL Team 6 and Delta into what is arguably the most agile and deadly force in history. One of the key officers under McChrystal was Bill McRaven, who took over command from McChrystal as head of JSOC when McChrystal went to take a senior job at the Pentagon. McRaven is a strapping, dark-haired, blue-eyed Texan in his mid-50s. In conversation as he chugs a Rip It -- a heavily caffeinated beverage popular with American soldiers in Afghanistan -- he speaks in well thought-out paragraphs, but he also peppers his speech with the occasional "doggone," as well as other, more robust swear words. A battle-hardened colleague says McRaven reminds him of the comic book superhero Captain America, while another says he "is reputed to be the smartest SEAL that ever lived. He is physically tough, compassionate and can drive a knife through your ribs in a nanosecond." Even as a three-star admiral, about once a month in Afghanistan, McRaven went out with his teams on snatch-and-grab missions. It was McRaven who planned the bin Laden raid down to the last details. Now he commands Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, which oversees special operations by the Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines. According to its mission statement, SOCOM's job is to "synchronize planning of global operations against terrorist networks." A sign of where the Obama administration is placing its bets about what it believes to be the future of warfare is that while there are major cuts planned for all four of the armed services, SOCOM is one of the few places in the military where the force is actually growing.
Malala Yousufzai, the Pakistani teenager who defied Taliban attackers to promote education for girls, says she's "feeling all right" after two weekend surgeries. Doctors attached a titanium plate to her skull and implanted a cochlear device to restore hearing to her left ear. Read more: The girl the Taliban wanted dead "I'm happy that both of the operations are successful," she said Monday from her bed at a Birmingham hospital. "I can walk a little bit and I'm feeling better." She hopes to be fully recovered in about a month, she said. Malala "has no long-lasting brain injuries" after being shot in the head by Taliban gunmen last October, her brain surgeon, Dr. Anwen White, said Monday. Read more: Malala's journey from near death to recovery "She won't need any further surgery," White said. The five-hour operation took place Sunday at a Birmingham hospital. After surgeons attached the titanium plate and inserted the implant, the 15-year-old Malala was "very focused and enthusiastic," White said. Shortly after the shooting, Malala's brain swelled dangerously, so doctors in Pakistan extracted a section of her skull about the size of a hand. Otherwise, the pressure in her cranium would have caused severe brain damage, likely killing her. Doctors then temporarily implanted the skull piece in her abdomen -- a common procedure to preserve bone fragments for later use. The skull piece would have no longer fit properly without the addition of some titanium parts, as her head and the bone fragment have changed. Titanium also has a low incidence of infection and can be handcrafted to near perfection, doctors said. Pakistan's Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid On Saturday, before the surgery, Malala credited her survival to "the prayers of the people." "Because of these prayers, God has given me this new life and I want to serve and I want every girl, every child to be educated," she said. "She's already talking about furthering her cause," said the hospital's medical director, Dr. Dave Rosser. The terrorists have said they will target her again. Malala had become deaf when gunfire from the attack broke the delicate bones that help turn sound into sensory impulses to the brain. The cochlear device will not allow her to hear completely naturally, Rosser said. But it will restore enough function to the damaged ear to allow her to hear things such as an approaching car, which obviously is important for safety.
which reused some campy Japanese programming -- a group of teens gets drafted to battle aliens.) "How is that any different from child soldiers, man? That's super f***ed-up," Shankar, the producer of "The Grey" and "Dredd," says in an accompanying video. "They're going to have PTSD, and they're going have the most f***ed-up lives." Hence, "Power/Rangers," which has been buzzed about all over the Internet. The less-violent version has picked up more than 6 million YouTube views in less than two days; the NSFW version has just slightly fewer. The video stars James Van Der Beek and Katee Sackhoff. Director Joseph Kahn, known as a music video powerhouse (Taylor Swift's "Blank Space," Britney Spears' "Toxic"), told HitFix that he was unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of the Power Rangers universe but liked the challenge. "The trick that I really wanted to do with this was to make that dark and gritty version that everybody keeps talking about, but really do it," he said. "Really see if I could totally accomplish it with essentially a really incredible incredibly silly property." The Internet was gobsmacked, of course. "Holy Hell This 'Power Rangers' Reboot Is Dark As F*ck," headlined Io9.com. But the video may be in for a legal battle. According to Kahn, the producer of the other "Power Rangers," Haim Saban, is "trying to shut 'Power/Rangers' down." A new theatrical film version is scheduled for 2016. Vimeo took down the NSFW video Tuesday, and Deadline Hollywood reported that it was at the behest of a copyright infringement claim. Kahn has fought back on Twitter. "Every image in 'Power/Rangers' is original footage," he posted in a series of tweets. "Nothing was pre-existing. There is no copyrighted footage in the short. I am not making any money on it and I refuse to accept any from anyone. It was not even kickstarted, I paid for it myself."
You would think that a black man born and raised in Georgia, who was a teenager during the civil rights movement, would understand the transition of African-Americans from voting overwhelmingly Republican to strongly supporting the Democratic Party. But the GOP presidential candidate clearly didn't have the common sense that he often speaks of having when he went on CNN's "The Situation Room" and accused many African-Americans of being brainwashed to vote Democratic. "Many African-Americans have been brainwashed into not being open-minded, not even considering a conservative point of view," Cain said. "I have received some of that same vitriol simply because I am running for the Republican nomination as a conservative. "So it's just brainwashing and people not being open-minded, pure and simple." Cain's off-base and historically ignorant comments have received widespread coverage. In some quarters, they have been criticized, while MSNBC's Pat Buchanan, who has a long history of racially offensive comments, didn't surprise many by coming to Cain's defense. It's not the first time I've heard someone question the reasons for blacks' allegiance to the Democratic Party, but history has to be taken into account. According to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank focused on African-American issues, in the aftermath of the Emancipation Proclamation, black folks who could vote in the United States quickly joined the Republican Party out of affection for President Abraham Lincoln. Check the political party affiliation of blacks elected during the period of Reconstruction and you will see a lot of R's after their names. The policies of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman, who desegregated the military, led more African-Americans to vote for the Democrats. Still, Dwight Eisenhower got 39 percent of the black vote when he ran for re-election in 1956; and Vice President Richard Nixon received 31 percent against the eventual winner, Sen. John F. Kennedy. The shift became more noticeable in 1964, when the Republican Party nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater as its presidential nominee. It was Goldwater's ardent stance against the Civil Rights Act that led President Lyndon Johnson to garner 94 percent of the black vote. What's interesting to note is the greatest threat to passage of the bill came from white Southern Democrats, known as Dixiecrats. Moderate Republicans played a crucial role in getting the Civil Rights Act passed, yet as the GOP began to go against civil rights, the national Democratic Party saw a chance to solidify the black vote. In 1968, Nixon returned to the national stage with his Southern Strategy, a detailed plan of racial politics that ignored, denigrated and dismissed black voters while playing up racial issues as a way to gain support from white voters. All of this was an outgrowth of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which led President Johnson to say his signing of the law would deliver the South to the GOP for the next generation. The Southern Strategy became the go-to play for Republicans over the next 40 years, as they virtually ignored the interests of black voters and catered to a largely white party. So on one hand you have a party that totally ignores black voters -- the GOP -- and then you have Democrats who see a chance to capture those same voters. If Republicans today are angry about a high level of animosity coming from black voters, they need to blame their white forefathers who wanted to see the racial divide continue over their refusal to allow African-Americans to be full citizens of the United States. The problem is that the GOP has done little to change the game since then, virtually ignoring African-Americans and advocating policies that blacks believe go against their interests. What is so shameful and asinine about Cain's "brainwashing " comment is that he assumes that African-Americans aren't smart and sophisticated enough to make their own choices. Just like whites, Asians, Hispanics, women, Catholics, Jews, Baptists, Wall Street bankers, or any other voting group, they look at the candidates, determine how they line up with their views, and make a selection. So when someone says that blacks don't vote with their brains, that's utterly false. Now, for all of the trolls who usually populate web sites comments sections saying I'm playing the race card, answer this: If I said that Southern whites were a bunch of brainwashed, dead heads who give the GOP their vote, how would you respond? U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that of the 10 poorest states in America, nine are mostly red states. The lowest when it comes to education? Mostly red states. The most obese? Worst health care? Mostly red states. So if the talking points suggest the Democrats advance poverty programs more than the GOP; push for more funding for education; and want a strong health care program, then why are these white voters in these mostly red states voting for the GOP? Have they been brainwashed by virtue of the Southern Strategy to keep voting straight ticket? The GOP has no real plan to even talk to black voters. They are afraid of them. Yes, afraid. If you want to put a Republican in the most uncomfortable position, then see them try to give a speech in front of a room of black folks. There is mistrust on both sides rather than straight talk on the issues. For years I have lamented the GOP's refusal to engage African-Americans. We care about housing, economic development, education, any host of issues. But in the minds of a lot of Republicans, it's all about welfare or affirmative action. African-Americans are largely social conservatives, but the GOP can't even figure out how to reach us even with God! I'm the host of Washington Watch, a weekly Sunday morning news show on TV One Cable Network, a lifestyles and entertainment network targeting African-Americans, and the GOP flat out refuses to even accept our invitations. For two years we've had an open invite for any House or Senate Republican to come on our show, no matter the week. Out of 80-plus shows, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia (twice) and Rep. Allen West of Florida (once) have accepted our invitations. West sat in my studio and told his press secretary to send an e-mail to every GOP press secretary in the House to tell them that my show was a great forum for them to talk to Black America. None followed his admonition. When Michael Steele was chairman of the Republican National Committee, he did my show several times. Steele told me he went to the GOP House and Senate leadership to tell them they should accept my invites, but none did. Now if the GOP is scared to even come on a TV show that targets blacks, do you actually think they'll show up in a black community? If the GOP wants black folks to consider voting for them, they their candidates will have to make an effort to reach out. The distrust is wide and great, but it can be overcome. But doing nothing will get you nowhere, other than guarantee that a strong voting bloc will do all it can to make sure you are defeated at the polls.

Marc Marquez tied the 1997 record of Australian legend Mick Doohan for most wins in a MotoGP season with victory Sunday in a thrilling Malaysian Grand Prix. It was the 12th win of the season for Repsol Honda's Marquez, who has already wrapped up his second straight world title. He had a race long battle with the Movistar Yamaha pair of Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo, who completed the podium in Sepang. The 21-year-old Marquez slipped to as low as ninth after a poor start from pole, but the Spaniard quickly worked his way back through the field, taking the lead for good on the 11th lap. Rossi, who won last week in Australia after Marquez crashed out, tracked him for the remainder of the race but finished 2.445 seconds adrift at the checkered flag. Italian legend Rossi has a 12-point advantage over his teammate Lorenzo in the battle for second place in the championship, heading into the final round in Valencia. Marquez will get the chance to beat Doohan's record on home soil and it is a prospect which thrills him. "I've equaled Mick Doohan's record, with one race left maybe I can beat it," he told the official MotoGP website. "If I had a bad result here the pressure in Valencia would be more. But now I am free in Valencia and I can do well for my fans and just enjoy it," he added. Marquez's teammate, Dani Pedrosa, saw his hopes ended by going off twice and he could not complete the race. The leading three were followed home, at some distance, by Germany's Stefan Bradl on a Honda and young British rider Bradley Smith on a Yamaha Tech 3. Smith's teammate, Pol Espargaro of Spain, came in sixth despite breaking a bone in his left foot in a fall during practice Saturday. Meanwhile, in the world rallying championship, Sebastien Ogier of France retained his global title with victory in the Rally of Spain Sunday. Ogier took the honors ahead of Volkswagen teammate Jari-Mari Latvala of Finland, the only man who could have denied him the title. Another Finn, Mikko Hirvonen, in a Ford Fiesta RS, was third. It was the seventh win in 12 rounds for the 30-year-old Ogier, who is only the fifth driver to achieve back-to-back title triumphs.
There's a courthouse adage: A person who represents himself has a fool for a client. When a defendant utters those tragic words, "I'm going to represent myself," judges blanch, attorneys snicker, and even the court reporters grimace. I've been on the opposite side of those who have chosen to represent themselves. It wasn't pleasant. Since 1975, when the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment "grants to the accused personally the right to make his own defense," many defendants have decided to take the law literally into their own hands. The most recent self-represented "client" is Anthony Pellicano, the Hollywood private investigator who's been on trial for 78 counts lodged against him and two co-defendants. Pellicano's jury has been out for a week, so it's not yet clear whether the outcome of his case will follow the conventional wisdom. The 64-year-old celebrity sleuth is accused of leading a criminal enterprise that raked in more than $2 million by illegally spying, allegedly using wiretaps and law enforcement databases, on Hollywood's rich and famous. He then dished the dirt to their rivals. If convicted of leading a criminal conspiracy, known as a RICO charge, he could spend up 20 years to life in prison. RICO, by the way, stands for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It's the law the Justice Department used to bring down the mob. Prosecutors have to prove that Pellicano and his co-defendants ran a corrupt enterprise that profited from information they obtained illegally. U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer granted Pellicano's request to represent himself, but she wasn't too happy about it. "If the U.S. Supreme Court didn't require me to let defendants represent themselves, I wouldn't do it," she said. Even without a law degree, Pellicano seemed to realize that getting the jury to acquit him of the conspiracy charge was important. During his 15-minute closing argument, he denied he led a criminal enterprise and insisted that he acted as a "lone ranger" while gathering information for his clients. He also told the jurors that he shared no information with colleagues as he conducted investigations and allowed others to learn only what he wanted them to know. "There was no criminal enterprise or conspiracy. Mr. Pellicano alone is responsible. That is the simple truth," he said, referring to himself in the third person. But unlike a seasoned attorney, he failed to address the evidence against him, including illegally taped conversations. Instead, he bragged about his career, while wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, saying of himself, again in the third person: "Perhaps his business card should read, 'I deliver,' because he did it over and over again." Courtroom observers said his "cross-examination" often consisted of little more than settling old scores. So is Pellicano a fool, or absolutely brilliant? Well, if history is our teacher, he would do better if he had a lawyer, even a bad one. If you have a bad lawyer and you get convicted, you can always argue on appeal that your lawyer was ineffective and get a new trial. The following self-appointed lawyers learned the hard way that they had fools for clients: In fact, I can't think of a defendant who represented himself or herself as well, or better, than a lawyer. So maybe I'm biased, but lawyers are trained professionals. We're trained in the art of trial war. Let us do our jobs.
Amazon may be coming out with its own smartphone, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The company reportedly is working with Foxconn to develop the hardware, which will likely run Amazon's version of the Android operating system. A phone isn't as far-fetched of an undertaking as it might seem for the company, which has never made a handset. Amazon already has many of the building blocks it would need to make money off a smartphone, including its own version of the Android operating system, an established app store and well-stocked content marketplaces that could make up a good chunk of revenue for the phone. It also has a pool of loyal customers who trust the brand. Amazon is relatively new to the hardware game. The company's first entry was the Kindle e-reader released in 2007, followed by its Android-powered big brother, the Kindle Fire tablet. Amazon has had more success than many other companies in the tablet market thanks to getting in early and a low price made possible by revenue from books, movies and music. However, the smartphone market is already filled with well-established competitors. Current market leader Samsung shipped 42.2 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2012, according to research firm IDC. Apple was a close second with 35.1 million smartphones, followed at a distance by Nokia and Research In Motion. There are also some challenges unique to selling smartphones. To build a decent device, Amazon will need the right patents so it doesn't end up on the receiving end of costly lawsuits. To that end, the company just hired a new general manager for patent acquisitions and investments, Matt Gordon. Dealing with carriers would be another hurdle. Ina Fried at AllThingsD floated an intriguing theory: Amazon could buy wireless service wholesale from the big carriers and bundle it with the devices, like it does for the Kindle. The rumor that Amazon would unveil a smartphone late this year surfaced in November 2011, when Citigroup's research department predicted the device based on its supply chain checks in Asia. The new report, based on two anonymous sources "with knowledge of the matter" supports the original theory floated by Citigroup.
"I may have spoken too soon," Bob Orsa said the other afternoon, with a sardonic laugh that didn't carry much mirth. He and I had first met exactly three years ago -- on September 18, 2008, toward the end of that frightening week when the American economy seemed to be on the verge of disintegrating. Lehman Brothers had collapsed, Merrill Lynch had been taken over by Bank of America, the stock market had plummeted, and the "too-big-to-fail" theory that would lead to the bailout of the major banks was forming. Things were a mess. Not that Bob Orsa was a player in those Wall Street and Washington machinations. He was a small businessman in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, a borough of about 18,000 people. Or -- more accurately -- he was about to become a small businessman in Chambersburg. In what would be described as the worst U.S. economic climate since the Great Depression, Orsa was getting ready to open the doors of a new restaurant on the town square. I'd been in Chambersburg interviewing longtime merchants about what rough financial times meant for them. And it was the new guy on the town square -- Bob Orsa -- who sounded, in the face of everything, optimistic. "Some time to open a new business, right?" he'd said as we had stood outside the restaurant looking at the old county courthouse across the way, as carpenters inside his building readied it for opening day. "But I feel good." Of the national economy, he'd said: "It'll all come back. History shows us that, doesn't it? It always comes back." I'd been thinking about him in recent days -- wondering how his restaurant had ended up doing, and whether he is as upbeat as he had seemed three years ago. I wanted to talk with him not because he is an expert in the intricacies of global finance, but precisely because he is not. He and small businesspeople like him are on the receiving end of the Wall Street decisions and convulsions that can lead to times as brutal as the ones the country has been dealing with. I just wanted to find out what was going on at his place on the Chambersburg town square. "I never thought the bad economy would be lasting this long," he said. The restaurant he opened is called Cafe D'Italia. It's not a big establishment: 36 seats, 11 tables, open for lunch and dinner. "I had thought it would take us two years to become solid and feel that we'd made it," he said. "Now I'm thinking it will take four years or more. People aren't eating out at restaurants as much as they would be in good times, because it's a way they can cut back on their expenses." He said he doesn't have to follow the stock market on a minute-to-minute basis to know how money worries and layoffs are affecting his customers. "The first thing you notice is that people will come in less frequently -- they'll still be loyal and come, but not as often as they might. This is a small town, and I know my customers. I know when I don't see them. "Going out to a restaurant is a luxury that can be scratched off. I'll see it in the individual dinner orders. A couple who would usually order two main dishes might order one and ask to split it. They'll skip the salad. Maybe they'll skip the dessert. I don't blame them -- it's a way to save a little more money." He finds himself in the same position as his guests: "People are pinching pennies out of necessity, and I am, too. I have 13 people working for me -- cooks, servers, hostesses, utility people. Ideally, I should have 17. But to warrant new hiring, I've got to have the right amount of business coming in, and I don't. "I just spent $18,000 to put in a walk-in refrigerator/freezer. That's a huge chunk of change for a small operation like mine. I waited 2 1/2 years to take that plunge. "Would I love to have another chef on staff? Absolutely. But my sales figures don't justify it. I can't afford it. I do the cooking myself two or three nights a week." Orsa is 56 and has been in the restaurant business for 30 years, he says, "and I'd be the first to know if I thought my quality was down, or the service was not what it should be. That's not it. Even in good times, if you have a good product, a good location, good service, making a business a success requires good luck, too. No one guarantees that you're going to make it. "But in this economy, with this kind of joblessness, making a go of a small business becomes even more of a challenge." He feels a little cynical about the too-big-to-fail mantra that bailed out the major banks. "There's no 'too small to fail' for businesses like ours. No one's going to save us if we can't make it." He said that since opening he has always met his payroll and always paid his vendors, but that with revenues about 20 to 25 percent less than what he would like them to be, "there have been more than a few weeks when I haven't been able to pay the last person who gets paid: me." When things are tough, he doesn't have to ask his customers to explain, because "I can see it. You know how people look when it's been raining for two straight weeks -- tense, a little down? That's the look, even when the sun is out." Yet the high hopes he had for his business when he and I met three years ago are still there, and so is the pride in what he -- like so many small business people across the country in this economy -- is trying to do: "Just being proud of what you've built. Being a part of the life of the town. I like it that I have afforded 13 people a living for almost three years now. Winter's coming, and sales tend to go down in the winter, at the same time the energy costs for heating this place go up. But that's all right. We've got a business right here in the center of town, and it wasn't here before we built it, and we're going to make it." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.
Baz Luhrmann is the type of director for whom the word innovative was invented. Luhrmann and his costume designer wife Catherine Martin, who is a long time collaborator. With a filmography comprising of just three full-length feature films, (and one currently in post-production) Luhrmann has produced a stunning and highly visual body of work that is loved and loathed in equal measures. His films have a tendency to suck the viewer up into a swirling vortex of lush imagery and a lavish production style, often with a frenetic pace that one critic described as being like "a madman on Benzedrine". But there is a method to Luhrmann's madness. The trio of films, "Strictly Ballroom," an adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" and "Moulin Rouge!" all form part of a specific filmmaking technique described by Luhrmann as "The Red Curtain" cinema. Luhrmann incorporates traditional theatrical conventions into his films and morphs them to create visual treats in stories set in heightened otherworlds. Simple devices like song and dance are then used to drive the action. He always surrounds himself with the same creative team for all of his projects. His wife, production and costume designer Catherine Martin, who is known as CM, is intrinsic to his striking visual style. In his directorial debut "Strictly Ballroom," Luhrmann injected dazzling colors and energetic dance moves into the stuffy world of ballroom dancing and was credited with making the genre hip again. Luhrmann himself was a ballroom dancer from the age of six, and the film reflects his affection for and intimate knowledge of that world. An intensely personal director who always draws on his own experiences, Luhrmann told CNN's The Screening Room: "Art and life cannot be separated, they feed each other and creative decisions are based on what will make life rich and what will enrich the story telling. What I make comes from a personal level." It paid off for "Strictly Ballroom," which became a global hit, winning eight Australian Film Institute Awards, three BAFTAs, and the Cannes Film Festival's Prix de Jeunesse in 1992. In 1996, Luhrmann worked his magic again in "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet," an MTV-style version of the classic love story set in latter-day Miami Beach, complete with warring gangs wielding automatic weapons. But it was in "Moulin Rouge!" that the Red Curtain's opulent and extravagant theatrical style would explode in, spectacular, some would say violent, fashion. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, it explored a young writer's foray into the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Following the film's box-office success Luhrmann landed a highly lucrative Chanel contract, making a Red Curtain-inspired 2004 film for Chanel No. 5, starring Nicole Kidman. At $36m, it is reputedly one of the most expensive adverts of all time. The maverick movie-maker began his film career as an actor, training at the prestigious National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney, but it wasn't long before he was employing his flamboyant and creative talent behind the scenes. What seems to drive Luhrmann is his huge passion and appetite for all art forms. He is a veritable Jack-of-all trades: a writer-director who has produced theatre and opera pieces, worked as a guest editor for Australian Vogue and in 1999, Luhrmann scored a surprise-hit single with "Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)." Following his Red Curtain trilogy, Luhrmann planned to move onto epic storytelling. He started work on a retelling of Alexander the Great, set to star Leonardo DiCaprio. But the film was set aside when Oliver Stone's version was released -- and flopped -- in 2004. ""My next great passion after musicals is the epic-- telling a recognizable universal story using a vast canvas of a far away place and historical events," he tells CNN. "I embarked on that in my exploration of doing Alexander the Great. At one stage, I was collaborating with DreamWorks and Steven Spielberg. "We were looking at sets around the world and studios were built in Northern Africa and Thailand. It got a long way down the road but for various reasons, not just because of the competing project, we walked away from it," he explains. "For where we were in our life particularly because we were embarking on a very personal part of our story to have children, it wasn't right. "It's all about the timing and what is right for your life in that moment in time. We walked away from that and I never regret that for a second." After a seven-year hiatus, during which he and CM have had two "magical, incredible children," Luhrmann has finally made his epic film, simply titled "Australia," with a budget of $130m, making it the expensive movie ever made in the country. "Australia" is a love letter to his home country. In it Nicole Kidman plays an English aristocrat who travels to 1930s Australia to sell a cattle ranch. A grueling journey across country with a rough drover (Hugh Jackman) ends with the pair witnessing the Japanese bombardment of Darwin at the start of the Second World War. "It's been a long time since we've had those huge banquet like motion pictures, when I was a kid, if a big epic was coming it was a big event and the whole family went," Luhrmann says. "It's big drama, comedy, landscape -- a huge banquet and I would like to invite the audience to this cinematic table." Luhrmann is unsure if the departure from his normal style is a good career move but is adamant "it's a good life move." "We found our inner spirit enlivened again," he says. Luhrmann, (unlike CM), has been thus far overlooked for an Oscar award, but "Australia," a big, bold movie with a vast emotional landscape is just the sort of film the Academy loves. Come 2009, it seems they will no longer be able to ignore Luhrmann's considerable -- and -- inimitable talents. What do you think of Luhrmann's cinematic style? Do you love it or loathe it?

Investigators involved in the case of serial killing suspect Elias Abuelazam went to Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday to retrieve two of his bags, Michigan police said. Abuelazam is suspected of slashing 18 victims in Michigan, Virginia and Ohio, killing five. He was arrested at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, last week as he was attempting to board a flight to Israel. Abuelazam has agreed to be sent back to Michigan to face charges, but he remains in custody in Atlanta. Michigan authorities have some two weeks to pick him up. As of Monday afternoon, police said they do not know how, or when, Abuelazam will be transported. He traveled last week from Detroit, Michigan, to Louisville, before heading to Atlanta, police said. The airline company misplaced his luggage and the bags never made it to Atlanta, they added. Michigan authorities said they took the two bags back with them. Lt. Steven Sipes of the Michigan police declined to say what was in the luggage, but he added the bags are now part of the department's investigation. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.
A prominent Thai political activist was shot and wounded Wednesday, the day after the national government declared a state of emergency amid violence-plagued protests in Bangkok, a police official said. Unidentified people in a pickup truck opened fire on Kwanchai Praipana, a local leader of the pro-government "red shirt" movement, outside his home in Udon Thani province in northeastern Thailand, said police official Col. Kovit Charionwattanasak. His wounds aren't life-threatening, Kovit said. Police suspect the shooting may be politically motivated, he said, but they haven't ruled out a connection to Kwanchai's "personal conflicts." The attack is likely to fan tensions in Thailand's political crisis. In Bangkok, demonstrations against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra have been hit by attacks with explosives in the past week that have killed one person and wounded dozens. The violence, whose perpetrators haven't been identified, prompted authorities to impose the state of emergency, which went into effect Wednesday and lasts 60 days. The emergency decree gives authorities the power to impose curfews, detain suspects without court permission, censor media and declare parts of the capital off-limits. Political divide The red shirts -- who draw their support from the populous, less affluent northeast of Thailand -- support Yingluck's government. On the other side of the country's political divide are the anti-government protesters, who are loosely allied with the opposition Democrat Party. Since the protesters began their campaign against Yingluck's government in November, at least nine people have died and hundreds have been wounded, according to authorities. In a bid to resolve the crisis, Yingluck dissolved parliament last month and called for new elections to be held February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters. They have called on Yingluck to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected "people's council," which would see through electoral and political changes. They want the elections postponed, and the Democrat Party has said it will boycott the vote. Protesters remain on streets Thailand's national security chief, Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathubut said the emergency decree had been considered because "we are predicting that (the) situation might get more violent" as the vote nears. "We are witnessing more gun shootings and bomb incidents on the streets of Bangkok," he said. Thousands of protesters have remained on the streets ahead of the elections. The latest round of demonstrations, which began last week, was aimed at shutting down Bangkok. They have succeeded in disrupting traffic at major intersections in the city, but their numbers have fallen significantly since the initial rallies. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. They say Yingluck is merely a puppet of Thaksin, a divisive figure who built his support on populist policies that pleased residents of the north and northeast. Yingluck has repeatedly denied her brother calls the shots in the government. The protest movement in Bangkok began as an angry response to a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for Thaksin's return. Thailand's worst bout of civil unrest took place in 2010, when the government -- run at the time by the Democrat Party -- ordered a crackdown on red shirt protesters, leaving about 90 people dead. CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.
Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year. The Michigan Republican made the announcement on Detroit's WJR radio station, saying he will host a syndicated radio program that will talk about national security issues and other news of the day. "I had a career before politics and always planned to have one after," Rogers said in a statement. "The genius of our institutions is they are not dependent on the individual temporary occupants privileged to serve. That is why I have decided not to seek re- election to Congress in 2014." Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House Speaker John Boehner, has been a staunch supporter of National Security Agency surveillance programs, which came under fire after leaks by Edward Snowden publicly disclosed their sweeping nature. This week, he and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland -- the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee -- came up with a plan for ending the NSA's sweeping collection of bulk telephone records. Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has stridently criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor. He also has acknowledged public worries about government storage of surveillance data. "That's really what we're trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs," Rogers said recently. Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek their temporarily renewal while Congress works on reform legislation, a senior administration official said. Rogers is also a favorite of Sunday public affairs programming on which he frequently criticizes Obama. He joins a cadre of House members not seeking reelection in November, but his seat in the 8th Congressional District is still considered relatively safe for Republicans. But the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report shifted their analysis of the district from "likely Republican" to "lean Republican" for the November election following Rogers' announcement. Democrats sought to tie together Rogers and Boehner. "Senior Republican committee chairmen continue to flee John Boehner's broken Congress rather than defend their indefensible record of siding with special interests over middle class families that has earned them record low approval ratings," Rep. Steve Israel of New York who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Rogers became a key figure in developing U.S. national security policy, informed by his experience as an Army officer and FBI special agent. U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8 "Mike has spent his entire life ensuring our country has been kept safe from threats both foreign and domestic," National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden said in a statement. "He never once let partisan politics stand in the way of doing what's right for our nation and its safety. I can't think of anyone who enjoys more respect from both Republicans and Democrats alike." Before Rogers became chairman, he issued an Intelligence Committee report "on Iran's nuclear ambitions, authored a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act," his Intelligence Committee biography said. "Mike Rogers is as solid as they come -- one of those patriots willing to go to the wall to keep the American people safe, no matter the strain or sacrifice," Boehner said in a statement. CNN's Jim Acosta, Tom Cohen, Lisa Desjardins and John Helton contributed to this report.
Havana, Cuba (CNN)Two weeks after the United States and Cuba agreed to thaw decades of icy relations, the U.S. State Department blasted the Cuban government for reportedly arresting at least six dissidents. There was no comment from Cuban authorities on the arrests that were reported by other dissidents and the U.S. State Department. "We are deeply concerned about the latest reports of detentions and arrests by Cuban authorities of peaceful civil society members and activists," State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said in a statement. Roberta Jacobson, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, wrote Tuesday on Twitter that "Freedom of expression remains core of U.S. policy on ‪Cuba, we support activists exercising those rights and condemn today's detentions." Jacobson is expected to travel to Havana in January to lead U.S. efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, U.S. government officials had previously said. The reported detentions came after a Cuban performance artist called for an open forum to demand changes from the country's single-party communist government. The event was due to take place in Havana's revolution square, the central plaza usually reserved for speeches from Fidel and Raul Castro and visiting dignitaries like Pope John Paul II. Cuban dissidents said the artist, Tania Bruguera, well-known for pushing the limits of freedom of expression in Cuba, was also arrested before the protest could begin. Bruguera had tried to convince Cuban officials to allow the event to go forward but on Tuesday the government-run union for artists and writers released a statement calling her proposal a "political provocation" meant to derail improving U.S.-Cuban relations. Government critic and blogger Yoani Sanchez wrote that she supported the event but on Tuesday tweeted that she was under house arrest and her husband had been taken away by police. CNN saw a police car and two uniformed police officers, as well as at least two men in civilian clothes who appeared to be security agents, outside the building where Sanchez lives on Tuesday. No one answered her door when the CNN crew tried to reach her for comment. Cubans have limited access to the Internet and despite a social media campaign to raise awareness about the event, the protest never materialized Tuesday. On December 17, Cuba released U.S. contractor Alan Gross, who'd been held since 2009 for smuggling satellite equipment onto the island. His freedom was part of a landmark deal paving the way for a major overhaul in U.S. policy toward Cuba. Cuba also freed a Cuban double agent who had worked as a U.S. intelligence source and who'd been held for more than 20 years, although authorities did not identify that person for security reasons. For its part, the United States released three of five Cuban intelligence agents convicted of espionage in 2001.
Has Gary Player found the secret to eternal life? The 78-year-old completes 1,300 sit ups every day, follows a strict and mainly vegetarian diet and sleeps on average nine hours per night. During a remarkable competitive career spanning six decades, Player won nine majors and 165 tournaments, adopting a grueling fitness and a practice regime to help underpin his game. "The more I practice the luckier I get," was his most famous quote in reference to his unerring ability to hole shots from green side bunkers. Player's forays on to a golf course are now confined to exhibitions -- "Jack Nicklaus and I were 10-under for a better ball three weeks ago," he says -- though he still regularly beats his age by several shots. "I was 12-under par (18 holes in 66 shots) recently," added the South African, who turns 79 in November. The day before this interview he'd hit 100 practice shots, so it's hardly surprising Player is still able to average about 70 shots per round, which is the mark he achieved during his professional career on the PGA then Seniors Tour, one of the best of all time. Nowadays Player is driven by a different mission. "I have a passion to save lives," he says, in reference to his desire to help confront the western world's growing obesity and type 2 diabetes problem. "Thirteen percent of the world is now obese," Player told CNN ahead of the British Open, which starts on Thursday. "We talk about wars, the number of people dying from diabetes and cancer and heart attacks -- in comparison to the numbers killed in wars are insignificant, but nobody cares about health or exercise. "I don't know why only one out of 20,000 people taka exercise and has a proper diet. How can governments allow it? Golf's "Black Knight" -- a reference to his trademark all-black attire he wore on the fairways -- doesn't expect the world to emulate his own punishing fitness regime, but he does have some simple tips to stay healthy. "My advice to fellow menfolk is every day to take you wife by the hand and go for a brisk 30 minutes walk, or get yourself a dog, they demand to be exercised! "Secondly don't go for all these fad diets, just eat half the portion of food that you originally dished up. It will change your life." The golf icon's foundation, run by his son Marc -- Player has six children and 22 grandchildren -- has raised over $50 million for underprivileged children in South Africa and around the globe. It aims to improve educational outcomes and Player is passionate that his message about health, fitness and diet reaches the younger audience globally. "We are not teaching children in school, that's a great frustration for me." Player with Nicklaus and legendary American Arnold Palmer revolutionized golf in the early 1960s and under sports management guru Mark McCormack earned the label of the "Big Three" as they dominated the majors and took the sport to a new television audience. Player had an unquenchable thirst for victory, racking up more air miles than any athlete in history as he competed in tournaments around the world. He is particularly proud of his nine 'senior' majors -- in competitions for golfers aged over 50 -- helping to raise the standard and profile of the events as he battled it out with the likes of Palmer and Nicklaus again. Don't dare tell Player that golf isn't a physically demanding sport. The South African recounts a story about basketball legend Michael Jordan, a low handicap golfer, telling him that 36 holes of golf in a day was pretty much as exhausting as playing in a match in the NBA Finals. A slight exaggeration perhaps, but judging by the number of nonagenarians who still inhabit the fairways the notion of Golf: "A Game for Life" -- the title of Player's latest instructional offering -- might not be too far amiss. In keeping with his reputation for supreme physical fitness there is a clip which shows him -- donned in black golf wear -- running at maximum speed on a treadmill -- to the astonishment of the accompanying interviewer. Watch: Player in incredible running demonstration It's a breathless demonstration that men several decades younger would fail to emulate but does back up Player's central theme about a healthy life. "I tell you, walk 18 holes, it's tremendous exercise and you can play golf for a lifetime," he said. On the evidence of Player's fitness -- a recent test showed he had a resting heart beat of 39 -- the South African will be gracing the fairways of golf courses for many years to come. But he clearly wants to leave a legacy stretching beyond his sporting fame. "I said when I'm a champion I'm going to change people's lives. "On my epitaph I want it to read: 'Here was a man who contributed to society and saved lives.'" So for now he continues his punishing schedule of travel to meet burgeoning business commitments,such as golf course design, real estate, a winery and farm, as well as work for his foundation, which runs four high profile tournaments each year. "Show me a busy man and I'll show you someone who gets things done." That work ethic was engrained in him from an early age, with his mother dying when he was just eight and his father having to travel away to earn a living in gold mining.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: One year after it became law, what is the reaction to the government's stimulus program? I'm Carl Azuz, and this is CNN Student News! First Up: Stimulus One Year Later AZUZ: An absolute success that's created or saved millions of jobs. A massive waste that has raised the country's debt. Two opinions on the very same subject: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Most folks just call it the stimulus plan. It was passed one year ago yesterday with a price tag of around $787 billion. That has since been re-estimated at $862 billion. The goal was to boost the country's economy by cutting taxes and through government spending. And that is exactly what President Obama says the stimulus has done. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: One year later it is largely thanks to the Recovery Act that a second Depression is no longer a possibility. It's one of the main reasons the economy has gone from shrinking by 6 percent to growing at about 6 percent. So far, the Recovery Act is responsible for the jobs of about two million Americans who would otherwise be unemployed. AZUZ: But other people disagree. In a recent CNN poll, nearly three-quarters of the people surveyed think that at least half of the stimulus money spent so far has been wasted. Earlier this week, Republican Representative John Boehner, the House minority leader, said that people, "aren't getting their money's worth from the trillion-dollar 'stimulus,' and struggling families and small businesses are rightly asking 'Where are the jobs?'" Blog Promo AZUZ: So in your view, has the stimulus worked? Got a few comments for you. Sean is saying: "Without it, we would be struggling in an even deeper recession." From Leisha: "What stimulus? Well, we have seen only more jobs cut and more schools closed in my state." And Sabrina writes that "the process takes a long time, so maybe the key points just haven't been fully recognized." What do you say? Blog with us from A to Z at CNNStudentNews.com. Toyota Troubles AZUZ: Another story we are following for you today: Toyota -- Japanese carmaker -- says it's going to hire more quality control workers, do more testing, and get an outside agency to help fix its cars' problems. The news comes in the middle of a massive recall of more than 8 million Toyota vehicles worldwide. Problems include sudden acceleration brake pedal issues, and some new complaints -- Toyota says fewer than a hundred -- involve the steering in some Corollas, Toyota's second-most popular model. Later this month, the U.S. Congress is planning hearings to ask Toyota about safety. The company says it will cooperate, and its president has repeatedly apologized. AKIO TOYODA, TOYOTA PRESIDENT [TRANSLATED]: Toyota is not perfect. But when we find a problem or are made aware of it, we act as quickly as possible. We are sincerely working on that. As VP Sasaki said, we never covered anything up or ignored any problems. I hope you understand this. TSA Swabs AZUZ: Get your boarding pass. Check in your luggage. Put out your palms. What? That last one could be what some air travelers hear. The Transportation Security Administration is trying out a new safety check, scanning passengers' hands for traces of explosives. Experts say there's a better chance of finding these kinds of materials if you check someone's hands rather than checking baggage. The goal, of course, is to help increase airline security. The government says that part of the way it does that is by using different kinds of technology, like these hand swabs. A privacy expert says this policy shouldn't violate passengers' privacy as long as the scans are conducted randomly. Fast Facts MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for some fast facts! Haiti and the Dominican Republic make up the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Spain controlled the island for a time, but Haiti became a French colony in 1697. The nation gained its independence from France in 1804. Today, Haiti is home to about 9 million people, and its capital is Port-au-Prince. Haiti Update AZUZ: France controlled Haiti for more than a century, but this week marked the first time that a French president ever visited the country. Nicolas Sarkozy, whom you see on the left here, was in Haiti yesterday. President Sarkozy met with Haitian leaders and toured some of the areas damaged by last month's earthquake. The French president was expected to announce an aid program for Haiti during his visit. This has been the scene at the airport in Port-au-Prince: planes being used to bring in relief supplies. That could change on Friday, though. American Airlines says it will start flying passenger planes into Haiti. All passenger flights were stopped after the quake hit. One company official said that offering transportation to and from the country will be a major step toward helping Haiti rebuild. Haiti Survivor Story AZUZ: Some Haitians have already left the country; they were evacuated to hospitals in the U.S. One of them, a classical musician, had injuries that could have affected his career. But as John Zarrella tells us, a gift from an American singer will help him keep making music. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For 18 hours, Romel Joseph lay buried in the rubble of his music school in Port-au-Prince. For 18 hours until his rescue, the concert violinist stayed alert and alive going over in his head, one by one, every concerto at every concert hall he'd ever played. Romel was badly broken. His legs crushed, bones in his left hand shattered. But the concrete that covered him would not, could not kill him. ROMEL JOSEPH, VIOLINIST: I thought my time was up under the ground, and God says no, you have things to do. ZARRELLA: Three weeks ago, we met Romel, who is legally blind, for the first time. He mentioned he'd like a keyboard to help strengthen the fingers in his left hand so that some day he could again play the violin. Stevie Wonder heard and answered Romel's request. STEVIE WONDER, SINGER/SONGWRITER: What better way to really express our God's love than to give something that is special to you to someone else who is in need. So, that's why I did what I did. ZARRELLA: Wonder's keyboard was packed and shipped, arriving Tuesday at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. Romel didn't know it was on the way. ZARRELLA: Romel. JOSEPH: Yes, sir. ZARRELLA: Hey, John Zarrella from CNN. How are you? JOSEPH: Oh, my goodness. ZARRELLA: It's so good to see you again. You look terrific. I think we have something for you. JOSEPH: Oh, it came? ZARRELLA: It came. It's coming in the door right now. JOSEPH: Oh, my goodness. ZARRELLA: Now, who sent this to you? Stevie Wonder. JOSEPH: Oh. ZARRELLA: As the keyboard was set up, Romel was carefully moved to a wheelchair. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The chair is over here. JOSEPH: OK. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, I'm going to have you go sideways. Keep your legs on the bed. ZARRELLA: He sat over the keyboard, his legs, one held together with metal rods, resting on pillows. JOSEPH: I'll play something. ZARRELLA: He began to play. Of course, a Stevie Wonder song. Even the fingers on his damaged left hand glided across the keys with a gentle touch. Romel will be out of the hospital soon. When that happens, he'd like nothing more than to play a concert for Haiti. He on the violin and Stevie Wonder on the keyboard. JOSEPH: I mean, you know, nothing is impossible. (END VIDEO) Shoutout TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. DeWerff's American History class at Pawnee High School in Pawnee, Illinois! How far above the Earth's surface is the international space station? Is it: A) 100 miles, B) 250 miles, C) 375 miles or D) 1,000 miles? You've got three seconds -- GO! The international space station orbits the Earth from an altitude of about 250 miles. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Room with a View AZUZ: The astronauts on that station have a brand new window to the world -- seven of them, actually. It's a new part of the ISS that was installed during a spacewalk yesterday, the third and last planned spacewalk of space shuttle Endeavour's mission to the international space station. You can see the window covers opening up here. They're on a cupola, the top part of a new section of the ISS. And this is the view it gives: Earth from 250 miles up. That center window is about 32 inches across. The cupola, designed to give astronauts a better view of spacewalks and other activities outside the ISS. Facebook Promo AZUZ: Well, the big night is tonight. I will be live on Facebook, 7:00 p.m. Eastern, 4:00 p.m. Pacific, answering your questions. Log on and ask away! The address: Facebook.com/CNNStudentNews. Before We Go AZUZ: Before we go, this might qualify as a half-baked idea. Everything seems calm at first, but then -- please, y'all, there's enough cake to go around. There's actually a matrimonial method to this madness. That is because one of these lucky ladies ended the day with a proposal: her boyfriend using the ring that she found in that cake. It's valued at around $3,100, which makes this a true karat cake. Goodbye AZUZ: Finding the ring is awesome. The on-the-spot proposal, just the frosting on the cake. CNN Student News returns tomorrow, but we hope to hear from you tonight at Facebook! I'm Carl Azuz.
The death toll from flash flooding in southern France rose to 25 Thursday as rain continued to inundate the region, authorities said. Up to 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) of rain fell in some areas overnight, the Var prefecture said in a statement. Despite the additional rain, most of the flood waters have begun to recede and cleanup has begun. Some 104,000 homes were without electricity across the region, and 20,000 homes were without phone connections, the 10prefecture said. Rescue operations officially ended Thursday and authorities were focusing on the distribution of food and water,clearing debris and assisting residents of Draguignan, which was hardest hit, authorities said. The city is about 27 miles west of Cannes. Are you there? Send us your pictures or videos? Authorities warned residents not to drink water that appears or tastes unusual. They were distributing tens of thousands of bottles of water, along with meals, in the Draguignan area, the prefecture said. More local thunderstorms were forecast for Thursday afternoon and evening, the prefecture said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was expected to visit the stricken areas next week, authorities said. The flooding, which began Tuesday, forced 2,000 people into shelters, officials said Thursday. Some 1,200 firefighters and 650 police officers have taken part in the rescue effort, the prefecture said. More than 1,400 people have been rescued by helicopter and 100 have been rescued by boat. The flooding also forced French authorities to transfer more than 400 inmates at Draguignan prison to other prisons in the south of France. Var includes the Cote d'Azur, a popular tourist destination along the French Riviera. CNN's Jim Bittermann, Saskya Vandoorne and Pat Thompson contributed to this report.
Slashing red tape or ignoring ordinarily required paperwork, officials in the United States and the Netherlands have cleared the way for scores of Haitian orphans to leave their earthquake-ravaged homeland, according to officials from the two countries. All of the children had adoptions pending with prospective parents in the two countries before Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, and government officials said paperwork was expedited or put on hold to make transfers happen on an emergency basis. 300 children have pending adoption cases with American families. Six children arrived in Florida Sunday night, met by their adoptive parents with hugs and tears of happiness. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs has chartered a plane to pick up about 100 children Monday, spokesman Aad Meijer told CNN. Dutch Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin over the weekend granted the children entry into the country, although their paperwork, including travel and adoption documents, was incomplete, Justice Ministry spokesman Patrick Mikkelsen told CNN. About 44 of the orphans' adoptions had yet to be approved by a Haitian judge, even though they were matched to Dutch parents, Mikkelsen said. Dutch officials may seek the remaining approvals from Haiti once the children have already settled in the Netherlands, he added. Haiti is home to about 380,000 orphans, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, and that number is expected to grow in the wake of Tuesday's earthquake. And those who lived in orphanages before Tuesday may be homeless now, as reports of destroyed orphanages have come throughout the quake zone. Full coverage of the earthquake in Haiti Some children who lost parents in the quake or were separated from parents are being relocated to the Dominican Republic, a child advocacy group said. About 50 orphaned and abandoned children will arrive in the border town of Jimani on Wednesday, Kids Alive International said. The efforts, coordinated with the governments of both countries, will eventually take the children back to Haiti. Some will be reunited with parents who lost communication with their children in the quake's aftermath, the group said.

Ambitious plans to build a revolutionary 420-meter shape-shifting skyscraper in Dubai have been unveiled by architects. The 80-story Dynamic Tower, described as the "world's first building in motion," will also be the first skyscraper constructed from prefabricated units, according to a press statement released by New York-based architect David Fisher's Dynamic Group. Each floor would be capable of rotating independently, powered by wind turbines fitted between each floor. "You can adjust the shape the way you like every given moment," Fisher said. "It's not a piece of architecture somebody designed today and that's it. It remains forever. It's designed by life, shaped by time."  Watch how the tower would spin and twist » Apartments will sell for about $3,000 per square foot, making each unit range in price from about $4 million to $40 million. Work on the tower is to be completed by 2010, according to Dynamic's Web site. Fisher said that plans to build a second rotating skyscraper in Moscow were at an advanced stage and that the group intended to build a third tower in New York. He said developers and public officials in Canada, Europe and South Korea had also expressed interest in the project. But some have expressed skepticism. Fisher has never built a skyscraper before. He says he has teamed up with reputable architects and engineers in the United Kingdom and India. Although he has received a development license for construction in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, he has not disclosed the site of the building. The Moscow mayor's office said that it was looking into the project and that a decision had not been made. Fisher has called prefabricated construction techniques the "future of architecture" and says they will radically transform 4,000-year-old "brick-on-brick" building methods. By using preconstructed parts, Fisher said each story could be built in just seven days, resulting in environmentally cleaner building methods. He said that just 600 people on an assembly site and 80 technicians on the construction site would be needed to build the tower, compared with about 2,000 workers for a traditional project of a comparable scale. "It is unbelievable that real estate and construction, which is the leading sector of the world economy, is also the most primitive," Fisher is quoted as saying on Dynamic's Web site. "Most workers throughout the world still regularly use trowels that was first used by the Egyptians and then by the Romans. Buildings should not be different than any other product, and from now on they will be manufactured in a production facility." Dubai is experiencing a construction boom, with the Burj tower set to claim the title of the world's tallest building when it is completed in 2009. It is already home to the world's largest mall, and despite being in the Middle East, it boasts the largest indoor snow park in the world.
The Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers will contest Super Bowl XLV  after securing narrow victories in the NFC and AFC championship games Sunday night. The Packers beat the Chicago Bears 21-14 to claim the NFC title, with the Steelers joining them in grid-iron's showpiece game with a later 24-19 defeat of the New York Jets to claim the AFC honors. The pair will meet at the Dallas Cowboys Stadium in Texas on Sunday February 6 with the Packers playing their first Super Bowl in 13 years. "This is a dream come true, incredible feeling. I am at a loss for words," Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers told the official NFL website. Rodgers scored a touchdown on the first drive of the game and B.J. Raji later crossed on a 18-yard interception return to put Green Bay 21-7 ahead. Chicago's starting quarterback Jay Cutler struggled to make any impression as he was hampered by a knee injury. Third string Caleb Hanie took up the mantle and set up Chester Taylor for their first touchdown, but it was his mistake that allowed lineman Raji to lumber into the endzone. Hanie then picked out Earl Bennett to cut Green Bay's lead to seven points with nearly five minutes left on the clock, but he was again intercepted and the Packers held on. The Steelers, inspired by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, later sealed their third visit to the Super Bowl in eight years and eighth overall, but like the Packers had to survive nervous late moments. Rashard Mendenhall, who ran for 121 yards, scored their opening touchdown with Roethlisberger and William Gay also crossing as they built a 24-0 lead. The Jets battled back behind their star quarterback Mark Sanchez, who threw a pair of second half touchdown passes, the latter to Jerricho Cotchery that pulled them to 24-19 with just over three minutes left. But Roethlisberger made sure the Steelers kept their lead as he connected with Heath Miller and Antonio Brown to seal a memorable victory.
More than eight out of 10 Americans think Barack Obama will do a good job representing their country to the world, according to a new national poll published as the U.S. president set off on his first overseas trip since taking office. Barack and Michelle Obama wave from Air Force One before their departure for Europe. Obama's itinerary includes Thursday's key G-20 meeting in London, followed by a NATO summit on the French-German border and visits to the Czech Republic and Turkey. Seven in 10 people questioned in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey, released Tuesday, believe that leaders of other countries respect Obama -- a figure in sharp contrast to predecessor George W. Bush's poll ratings at the equivalent stage of his presidency. Just 49 percent of Americans believed that foreign leaders respected Bush shortly after he assumed office in 2001. "Except for the period following the 9/11 attacks, that number never got any better for Bush," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "Even among Republicans, a majority believes that other world leaders respect Obama." Obama's popularity in Europe was highlighted last year during a pre-election visit to Germany, France and the UK when hundreds of thousands turned out to hear the then-presidential candidate speak in Berlin. His election success in November was widely celebrated across the continent. But analysts say Obama is now under pressure to deliver on that popularity -- and will be held to higher standards than previous White House incumbents.  Watch how Obama-mania gripped Europe » "If there is a trade war between America and Europe and, as a result, European jobs are lost, that would make Barack Obama unpopular," British political commentator Peter Kellner told CNN. "Secondly if there was a sign to return the type of arrogance, as Europeans see it, under George W. Bush and other U.S. presidents that would damage his popularity." The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted March 12-15, with 1,019 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
Archaeologists believe a desert site in Jordan may contain the ruins of the elusive King Solomon's Mines. Researchers using carbon dating techniques at Khirbat en-Nahas in southern Jordan discovered that copper production took place there around the time King Solomon is said to have ruled the Israelites. The research findings were reported in this week's issue of the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which came out Monday. King Solomon is known in the Old Testament for his wisdom and wealth and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem. The fabled mines entered popular culture in 1885 with the publication in Great Britain of the bestselling "King Solomon's Mines" by Sir H. Rider Haggard. In the book, adventurers in search of the mines find gold, diamonds and ivory. Since then, the mines have been the the subject of several films. Yet their possible location -- and whether they exist at all -- remains cloaked in mystery. Thomas Levy of the University of California San Diego, who led the research, said carbon dating placed copper production at Khirbat en-Nahas (Arabic for 'Ruins of copper") in the 10th century -- in line with the biblical narrative of Solomon's rule. "We can't believe everything ancient writings tell us," Levy said in a university statement. "But this research represents a confluence between the archaeological and scientific data and the Bible." Khirbat en-Nahas is an arid region south of the Dead Sea, in Jordan's Faynan district. The Old Testament identifies the area with the Kingdom of Edom. As early as the 1930s, archaeologists linked the site to the Edomite kingdom, but some of those claims were dismissed in subsequent years. "Now ... we have evidence that complex societies were indeed active in 10th and 9th centuries BCE and that brings us back to the debate about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible narratives related to this period," Levy said.
claims that fell apart once American troops began searching for them. Charles Duelfer, the former head of U.S. weapons inspection teams in Iraq, said the U.N. experts will be looking to collect evidence from witnesses and survivors of last week's attack, including samples that can be analyzed later. "They'll be looking for remnants of the munitions, which could be sophisticated munitions that a military would have -- or if it turns out, unexpectedly, to be the case that the insurgents had cobbled together some sort of CW capability, maybe they'll find that," Duelfer said. Duelfer said he expects the U.S. government has its own sources: "Presumably, the National Security Agency can listen to people besides the United States, so they may have data which the weapons inspectors may not have," he told The Situation Room. But while Washington's evidence may be solid, U.N. inspectors "provide credibility across the board." "When they say something, presumably all countries will say. 'OK, we can accept that, they don't have a dog in that fight,' " Duelfer said. U.S. officials have said they have no credible evidence pointing to opposition groups using chemical weapons. And the Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's attack before any U.S. military action would take place, a senior administration official said Monday. That evidence "includes but is not limited to" satellite images of activity at Syrian military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots, a senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told CNN. And Kerry said he had argued to Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem last week that if the government had nothing to hide, "then their response should be immediate: immediate transparency, immediate access, not shelling." "Failure to permit that, I told him, would tell its own story," he said. Opinion: How Al-Assad used chemical weapons to poison debate on Syria Al-Assad: It wasn't us The Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region, and Obama will be presented with final options regarding actions against Syria in the next few days, a senior administration official said Monday. But as U.S. muscle plows the waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, al-Assad on Monday repeated his government's denial that his army had anything to do with the use of poison gas. "The area of the claimed attack is in contiguity with the Syrian army positions, so how is it possible that any country would use chemical weapons in an area where its own forces are located?" he asked in an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia. Al-Assad accused the United States, Britain and France of exploiting the incident by trying to verify rebel allegations instead of verifying facts. The use of a large amount of chemical weapons would cross a "red line" and threaten U.S. interests in the region, Obama announced last year. Tabler, who has had extensive contacts with al-Assad, said the Syrian leader may have watched as Washington reacted cautiously to previous reports of chemical warfare and gambled incorrectly that last week's attack would draw a similar response. "I think he thought that he could push the envelope again and that he could actually show his own people that no one is going to come to their rescue," Tabler said. Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack Opposition accusations Opposition members say rockets with chemical payloads were among the ordnance government troops unleashed at the rebel stronghold of Ghouta early Wednesday. More than 1,300 people died, most of them by gas, according to opposition spokesman Khaled al-Saleh. The opposition backed up the allegations with gruesome video of rows of dead bodies, including women and children. They had no visible wounds, and some appeared to be bloated. The aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres said three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate reported having received about 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms on Wednesday morning. But according to Syrian state-run television's depiction of events, government forces came into contact with a gas attack on Saturday in Jobar, on the edge of Damascus. Several of the soldiers were "suffocating" from exposure to gases as they entered the city, according to state TV. "It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area," Syrian TV reported, citing an anonymous source. The government uses the term "terrorists" to describe rebel forces. Broadcast video showed a room containing gas masks, gas canisters and other paraphernalia that could be used in a gas attack. The army said it uncovered the cache in a storage facility in the area. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of video shown by the government or rebels. Intervening in the Middle East turmoil: mission impossible?
"Breaking Bad's" Walter White has been off the air since late September, but his legacy is still looming over Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the series was set and filmed. Fans seeking one last goodbye to the TV character, who transformed from a milquetoast chemistry teacher into a treacherous meth kingpin over the course of five acclaimed seasons on AMC, gathered in Albuquerque on Saturday for a mock funeral. CNN affiliate KOAT said ahead of the service that the plan was to bury a "small vault filled with memorabilia" as fans said their goodbyes. With a eulogy given by "Breaking Bad" set decorator Michael Flowers and a procession led by a hearse, the show's famous banged-up RV, and a few Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department deputies, the event was attended by roughly 200 people, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The faux service, held at Albuquerque's Sunset Memorial Park, doubled as a fundraiser for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless, as attendees paid to participate. According to the funeral's website, $20 bought entrance to the funeral "and a handful of earth to help bury Walter White." Yet for some who have laid actual family members to rest at Sunset Memorial Park, the fake grave site is, at the least, a nuisance. "It's going to be difficult to look up and see something going on over there that really shouldn't," resident Manuel Arellano told KOAT. "This is too much. I bring my family here to visit their grandpa and my wife to visit her dad ... What's going to happen come Christmas, come Thanksgiving on those hard days for me and my family? It's hard to come when we miss my father-in-law so much. It's going to be hard to see people over there decorating something for somebody that wasn't real." More than 900 people who agree with that sentiment have signed an online petition asking Sunset Memorial Park to remove the grave site, which includes a headstone. Officials at the cemetery told the Albuquerque Journal that the mock burial was in the clear as long as the cemetery could remove the grave if it became a distraction for others. "We are a cemetery first and foremost," Sunset Memorial Park general manger Vaughn Hendren told the paper. "Our allegiance lies with our families that have allowed us to bury their loved ones here." The online petition asserts that "the 'officials' should not put the family members through such disrespect during the process of deciding whether or not too many people are visiting the makeshift grave." For now, it seems the petitioners have won out. According to KOAT, the AMC character's fake grave has been moved, and the headstone is not being kept at the cemetery. While fans may not always have a physical place to mourn the loss of White, who was played by Bryan Cranston, they can always hold on to the obituary. The Albuquerque Journal ran a notice about White's "death," as constructed by a "Breaking Bad" fan group, in its October 4 paper.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that they will seek the death penalty for a 22-year-old man accused in the shooting death last year of Eve Carson, student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Police said UNC student body President Eve Carson was taken from her home and killed. A grand jury indicted Demario James Atwater on October 27 on federal charges of carjacking resulting in death, carrying and using firearms in relation to carjacking, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and possessing a short-barreled shotgun not properly registered to him. He also faces state first-degree murder charges in Orange County, North Carolina, along with 18-year-old Lawrence Alvin Lovette. "Both federal and state law violations are implicated in the tragic events of March 5, 2008, and we will vigorously prosecute the violations of federal law committed in connection with the death of Eve Marie Carson," said Anna Mills Wagoner, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, at the time of Atwater's indictment. An autopsy report showed that Carson, an honors student, had multiple gunshot wounds when she was found lying on a Chapel Hill street. The autopsy report listed six gunshot wounds but said two of the wounds were probably from the same bullet. Court documents released in the North Carolina case said Carson was taken from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with ATM access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of March 5. Applications filed for search warrants said a confidential informant told police that Atwater said he and Lovette entered Carson's home through an open door and forced her to accompany them in her car. The informant said she had talked with Atwater after a picture was shown on television of someone attempting to use Carson's ATM card at a convenience store two days after her body was found. The informant said the two men drove Carson to an ATM, obtained her PIN from her and then shot her. The witness told police that Atwater said the two got about $1,400 from Carson's account. Bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period, the documents said. Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall has said he also will seek the death penalty against Atwater, according to the Raleigh News and Observer. Authorities cannot seek the death penalty against Lovette because he was 17 at the time of the slaying, the newspaper said. Carson's death shocked the community and drew national attention. An estimated 10,000 people turned out for a service in her honor. The Athens, Georgia, native was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology. She was a recipient of the university's prestigious Morehead Scholarship and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, according to UNC.
A German tourist bitten by a shark while she was vacationing in Hawaii died Wednesday, a week after the attack, her family said. Jana Lutteropp was remembered by her mother, Jutta Lutteropp, and sister, Julia Broeske, as "a very beautiful, strong young woman who was always laughing, and we will forever remember her that way." "Jana fought hard to stay alive," her relatives said. "However, we are sad to say that she lost her fight today." Shark bites teen's legs in latest attack in Hawaii The woman, believed to be about 20 years old, was snorkeling about 50 yards off the Hawaiian island of Maui when a shark severed her right arm around 4:40 p.m. on August 14, authorities said. "The water was choppy with limited visibility" at the time, the county of Maui noted on its Facebook page. Two male friends, who were nearby in the water, and a kayaker carried Lutteropp out of the water. First responders found her unconscious and took her to Maui Medical Center, said Lee Mainaga of the Maui Fire Department said. She was initially listed in critical condition. Shark attack claims Brazilian teen's life The incident spurred authorities to shut down beaches one mile on each side of where the attack happened. By noon the next day, Thursday, the beach reopened, according to the county. Lutteropp had traveled to Hawaii after finishing her year as an au pair, according to Cultural Care Au Pair, the agency she'd worked with. The agency said Wednesday, on its Facebook page, that Lutteropp died "surrounded by her family." "Please join us in keeping them in your thoughts and prayers," Cultural Care said. This shark attack is the fourth in Maui this year, with two happening on the same day in February, and the other in late July. Four days after the Maui incident, in Pohoiki Bay on what's known as the Big Island, a gray shark bit a 16-year-old  across both legs as he was surfing, CNN affiliate KHON reported. While shark attacks have been on the uptick in recent years, according to the University of Florida, the fatality rate in the United States is just 2%.
Thursday was an important day for the rule of law in the United States of America. With a handful of signatures to executive orders, President Obama ordered the eventual closure of Guantanamo Bay prison and CIA "black site" prisons, and placed interrogation in all American facilities by all U.S. personnel under the guidelines of the Army Field Manual. In a season of transformational changes, these are among the most meaningful, because they send a powerful message that America's struggle against terrorism will once against honor some of the most cherished ideals of our republic: respect for the rule of law, individual rights, and America's moral leadership. The president understands all too well that the threat our nation faces from terrorism is all too real. And we should all agree that sometimes, in the name of national security, it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the American people. However, I and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security. In this global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaeda and its allies, too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons: the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority. Torture plays directly into a central tenet of al Qaeda's recruiting pitch: that everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the United States of America. From Morocco to Malaysia, people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and other overseas prisons. The result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide, particularly where we need it most: in the Muslim world. Once permitted, torture and lawlessness are not easily contained. Coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high-level terrorists at Guantanamo to low-level detainees at Abu Ghraib. Years later, images of abuse there remain fixtures across the Arab and Muslim world. And as John McCain has argued, the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well. Torture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it, but from those who seek to conceal it. After years of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing, what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general-designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true: that yes, "waterboarding is torture." As we move forward, President Obama is wise to "reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals" -- but the American people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy. Reclaiming Guantanamo and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former Vice President Dick Cheney called "the dark side" will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues. However, we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader. Countries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join Albania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies. Still, it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles, many handed over from the previous administration: looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries; and the fact that we already know some released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield. In some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the American people. And even as we embrace long-overdue change, we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited, the sacred responsibility to protect American lives which they strove to honor, and the humbling reality that there are no easy answers when it comes to such life-and-death matters. But the American story is one of perfectibility and striving for ever-greater fidelity to our ideals -- it is a journey from colony to republic, from slavery to freedom, from sexism to suffrage, from stark poverty to shared prosperity. The president himself famously said, "The union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected." It is true that today we face unprecedented, unorthodox, and vastly destructive enemies that respect neither borders nor rules of war. But this is not the first new challenge America has evolved to meet. Sometimes that evolution requires us to admit mistakes, learn from them and grow as a nation. The desire to do better has always been a core part of America's greatness. Last week Barack Obama and his administration wrote a new chapter in that old story. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kerry.
Burkina Faso's fairytale at the Africa Cup of Nations will have one more enthralling chapter after it overcame the might of four-time champion Ghana to seal a place in the final for the very first time in South Africa Wednesday. In a contest which was marred by a number of mystifying refereeing decisions, Burkina Faso survived the sending off of striker David Pitroipa and the ruling out of a seemingly legitimate strike to prevail on penalties. With the game ending 1-1 after extra-time, it was the Burkinabe which held its nerve to progress 3-2 on penalties and advance to Sunday's showpiece final against Nigeria. 'Super Eagles' end Ivory Coast's AFCON hopes The Super Eagles had earlier booked their place in the final with a convincing 4-1 win over Mali in Durban. Burkina Faso, which had not won a game away from home at the tournament before arriving in South Afirca, had endured a frustrating night with referee Jdidi Slim's display a constant cause of consternation. But it will now have to take on Nigeria without star striker Jonathan Pitroipa, who was harshly shown a second yellow card for diving when it looked as if he had been fouled. Pitroipa's 117th minute dismissal leaves the Burkinabe without its two star strikers following the injury to talented forward Alain Traore. Burkina Faso should have been given the chance to take an early lead when John Boye sent Pitroipa hurtling towards the turf inside the Ghana penalty area, but the referee wrongly waved away appeals for a spot kick. Instead, it was Ghana which was controversially awarded a penalty after the Jdidi adjudged that Christian Atsu had been fouled inside the penalty area. Mubarak Wakaso stood up to fire home from 12 yards and net his fourth goal of the competition. What can we expect from the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations? With both teams struggling to play on a terrible surface at the Mbombela Stadium, the game lacked any real sort of quality. But what it lacked in quality it more than made up for in drama and excitement as Burkina Faso continued to fight back against a perceived injustice. Ghana goalkeeper Fatawu Dauda produced a wonderful reaction save to deny Aristide Bance, while Asamoah Gyan hit a post for the Black Stars. But with an hour on the clock, the underdog finally got its reward as Bance was allowed time and space to fire home a deserved equalizer. Burkina Faso make giant strides With the game moving into extra-time, Burkina Faso appeared to have scored a dramatic winner when Prejuce Nakoulma beat Dauda to the ball and prodded into the net. But most of those packed inside the stadium were left in disbelief when Jdidi ruled the goal out for a minor clash with Kwadwo Asamoah. Worse was to follow for the Burkinabe when Pitroipa was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for diving , despite replays showing he was quite clearly fouled. In the end, the contest went to penalties and it was Burkina Faso which held its nerve with Bakary Kone, Henri Traore and Bance all scoring to send it through to the final. Burkina captain Charles Kabore told reporters: "The referee is human, all humans make mistakes, but he happened to make too many tonight. But we're not going to dwell on that, we've qualified." 'Super Eagles' end Ivory Coast's AFCON hopes In the day's early kick off, Nigeria reached the final for the first time since 2000 following a comfortable victory over Mali. The Super Eages scored three times in 20 first half minutes to take control of the contest and leave manager Stephen Keshi dreaming of repeating the triumph he pulled off as a player in 1994. Elderson Echiejile headed Nigeria ahead on 25 minutes before Brown Ideye added a second on the half-hour mark. Momo Sissoko then deflected Emmanuel Emenike's free-kick into the Mali net to leave his side facing an uphill struggle. And Ahmed Musa, who replaced the injured Victor Moses , inflicted further punishment on Mali when he ran through to score eight minutes after the interval. Mali, which famously came back from 4-0 down to draw 4-4 with Angola in the opening game of the 2010 finals, pulled one back through substitute Cheick Diarra in the 75th minute. Nigeria go through But that failed to take the shine off for manager Keshi, who is now hoping to become only the second man in the tournament's history to win the tournament as a player and a coach after Egypt's Mahmoud El Gohary, who won it in 1959 and 1998. "We won in 1994 after we had been together for five years," he told reporters. "But we have been together for five weeks. We met up for the first time in our training camp in Portugal before the tournament, and it was a young group. "We worked hard, the atmosphere was wonderful but you cannot compare this team to that. We did play very well today and I am very happy but we haven't won anything yet."
because it's so perfect, the regime maintains. The North Korean regime controls and monitors the usage of the very words. The concept is not even taught. I had never even heard of the term "human rights" when I was in North Korea. It also strongly denies the existence of the political prison camp system throughout the country. It maintains this position even though I was born in the most infamous, political prison camp in North Korea: Camp 14. Even now, there are people who are born into a life of an inmate in a political prison camp. North Korea also denies committing human rights violations, threatens and intimidates defector activists working to raise awareness of human rights issues, and attacking and criticizing those who have testified during the United Nations Commission of Inquiry's investigation, calling these defectors "human scum." North Korea has also launched personal attacks on me, labeling me "human scum" and releasing a statement that my testimony is all based on lies. The dictatorship in North Korea has never been honest or truthful for more than six decades it has been in existence. Could North Korea change? The North Korean dictatorial regime should not just emptily deny that these political prison camps exist. If they are truly honorable and fair they should immediately allow an international inspection delegation, comprised of myself and organizations such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch, or the United Nations, to be able to conduct on-the-ground visitations to the political prison camps. These delegations must include political prison survivors like myself and other defectors. Only recently did they concede that "labor detention centers" exist, but solely for the incarcerated to have their lives improved "through their mentality and to look on their wrongdoings." Earlier this year, the UN published a report on the human rights situation in North Korea, through the Commission of Inquiry that was established last year. It was followed by a special North Korean human rights side event during the recent UN General Assembly in New York in which U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, and the Foreign Ministers of Japan and South Korea demanded improvements in North Korea's human rights record. To counter this, and perhaps fearing a challenge to its stability and of losing the initiative, the regime adamantly opposed and obstructed any discussions at the UN of a resolution regarding its rights record, as well as the issue being brought up at the Security Council. I believe ultimately the regime is using diplomatic tactics to deflect pressures from the international community regarding its nuclear ambitions, missile tests and human rights violations. Regime travels freely as North Koreans starve Some say that the most recent actions and conciliatory gestures on the part of the North Korean regime can lead to the revival of six-party talks and progress on the nuclear issue. But these talks have happened many times before, and the regime still goes ahead and conducts nuclear tests in a bid to become a nuclear power. This has showed the abject failure of the objectives of the six-party talks to denuclearize the peninsula. Even if negotiations were to be restarted, the attitude of the regime must change first -- most importantly by ceasing its provocative behavior. PHOTOS: The scale of North's camp system However, though there may be a temporary détente in tensions if the regime were to participate in restarted talks, it would be difficult to expect a fundamental change in attitude on the part of the North Korean regime. Also, the human rights issue must be on the same level as the nuclear issue and dealt with together, and for this to happen, the human rights issue must be included as an integral part of six-party talks. The international community must show continued interest and become actively involved. The dictator's family travel freely, while ordinary North Koreans cannot enjoy any freedom of travel. People are dying of hunger while the North Korean dictator wastes money on building a useless golf course and earns money from Western tourism, which both angers and saddens me. The dictatorship in Pyongyang says its citizens chose the system in North Korea through their own will and that they are happy. But there is no place, no country on this Earth where the people would knowingly choose a system that starves and kills its own citizens and be happy. Footnote: The North Korean government website Uriminzokkiri released videos about Shin Dong-hyuk this week, calling his testimonies lies. The video featured a man, Sin Kyong Sop, whom Shin recognized to be his father. In the video, which has English subtitles, Sin denies they lived at a prison camp. In response, Shin Dong-hyuk released this statement: "My only 'sin' against the North Korean dictator is that I told the entire world about the suffering of the political prison inmates in the political prison camps. My only 'crime' against the dictator is that I escaped from the political prison camp. I love my father. Through this, I seek my father's forgiveness. The dictator is holding my father hostage. No matter what the dictator does to my father, they cannot cover my eyes; no matter what the dictator does, they can not cover up my mouth."
Karen Schlieve and her fiancÃ© were supposed to be married in July on a pavilion in St. Paul, Minnesota, against the backdrop of the Mississippi River. But Mother Nature had other plans. Today, that same pavilion is under several feet of water, in a surge of flooding that has swept through several Minnesota towns. At the height of wedding season, Schlieve must now find a different venue. "I never would have thought, never would have imagined this would happen," Shlieve told CNN affiliate WCCO. In several cities across the state, communities are moving fast to protect their neighborhoods from rising floodwaters. In St. Paul, residents are using pumps to remove water from their properties, said meteorologist Chris Franks at the National Weather Service. And along the Minnesota River -- a tributary of the Mississippi River -- the community of Henderson has only one road to get around town, Franks said. Residents of Prior Lake are continuing to pile sandbags up to 5 feet high to protect their homes and businesses. People, wading through the high floodwaters, are building dikes to prepare for the rain forecasted for Saturday and Sunday. "The summers is pretty much over," said Gil Roscoe to CNN affiliate KARE. "Nobody wants to swim in this now." A particularly wet year is likely to blame for the floods. With just over 25 inches of rain since the beginning of 2014, the Twin Cities are on track to have the wettest year on record, Franks said. And heavy rain continued to fall in several cities -- Prior Lake included -- through the start of the weekend. But there could be an end in sight. Though the torrential rains continue, they'll likely have little to no effect on water levels because the Minnesota rivers are starting to recede, Franks said. "It's a very slow process, but the water levels are indeed going out."
It doesn't have the brutality of rugby or the physical intimidation of a boxing match, yet sailing is still one of the most dangerous sports in the world. Capsized: This French catamaran flipped near New Zealand while attempting to win the Jules Verne Trophy. This danger is never more evident than in the epic Volvo Ocean Race. The round-the-world event which begins this month in Alicante, Spain, always throws up its fair share of drama as the crews face all types of conditions right through to the race finish around July 2009. To give an idea of the extreme dangers this year's crews will face over the coming nine months, here is a look at some of the worst tragedies to strike yacht racing. There's no question about it: this is no sport for the faint-hearted. September 2008 Régates Royales-Trophée Panerai Death toll: One Wilfrid Tolhurst was killed during the famous Régates Royales-Trophée Panerai yacht race off Cannes that sees the major classic yachts in the Mediterranean gather. Skippering the eight-meter yacht, Safir, in the coastal race, Tolhurst was struck by the boat's falling mast that broke off under the impact of a collision with another boat, Rowdy. Although rescue crews reacted quickly to bring the skipper ashore, nothing could be done to save his life. A police inquiry is currently in progress to determine the cause of the incident. September 2008 Sean Whiston Perpetual Cup Race Death toll: One Kenneth Jones (46) lost his life while sailing in a race from Wicklow to the Poolbeg Yacht Club in Dublin, Ireland. It was not clear what caused the incident, however, a mayday was issued by the yacht Allanah, stating that there was 'a man in the water.' Jones was lifted from the water and transferred to Tallaght Hospital where he later died. May 2006 Volvo Ocean Race Death toll: One During the seventh leg of the race Hans Horrevoets, 32, of The Netherlands was swept overboard from ABN Amro Two in heavy seas. Although he was recovered from the water, attempts to resuscitate him were not successful. The savage storm that hit the fleet could easily have claimed more lives. The crew of Movistar abandoned ship after the aft end of their keel pivot broke away from their hull in the night -- less than 48 hours after Horrevoets died. The crew transferred to ABN Amro Two which had been standing by and was escorted by HMS Mersey back to land. December 1998 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: Six One of the saddest events in yachting history began at Sydney Harbor on December 26, 1998, when the annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race set off. Fierce storms and violent winds battered the 115-strong fleet in the famously tough event off the eastern coast of Australia and only 44 boats made it to the finish line at Hobart. Met by the massive storms, five boats sank, 66 boats retired from the race, six sailors died, and 55 sailors were taken off their yachts, most by helicopter. Among those who died were; Mike Bannister (Winston Churchill), Glyn Charles (Sword of Orion), John Dean (Winston Churchill), Bruce Guy (Business Post Naiad), Jim Lawler (Winston Churchill), Phillip Skeggs (Business Post Naiad). The vessels; Winston Churchill, VC Offshore Stand Aside, Sword of Orion, Miintinta, and Midnight Special all sank. 1989 Whitbread Round the World Race Death toll: One Competing boat Creighton's Naturally suffered a serious broach in the early hours of one morning during the second leg of the race, at about three in the morning. Crew members Anthony (Tony) Philips and Bart van den Dwey were swept over board. Both were pulled back on deck and although Van den Dwey was successfully resuscitated, after three hours of trying, crew members could not revive Philips. Several days later, by radio agreement with his relatives, Philips was buried at sea. December 1989 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One Peter Taylor, crew member aboard BP Flying Colours suffered fatal head injuries when a runner on his vessel broke and the rig collapsed in gale-force south westerly winds. December 1988 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One In another grueling race 38 of the 119 starters retired, nearly half of them with broken masts or damaged rigging. Ray Crawford aboard Billabong was killed. December 1984 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One Wally Russell of Yahoo II died during the 1984 edition of the race, which was hit by a low pressure system that created two different swell patterns. August 1979 Fastnet Yacht Race Death toll: Fifteen Huge storms in the Irish Sea wreaked havoc on more than 300 yachts taking part in the biennial race, resulting in 15 deaths and one of the worst yacht race disasters of all time. The race was well regarded after being established in 1925, and in 1979 was the climax of the five-race Admiral's Cup competition. As the storms battered the fleet, naval ships, lifeboats, commercial boats, and helicopters from the west side of the English Channel were brought to aid what was the largest peace-time rescue operation. The rescue effort saw 125 sailors, whose boats had been caught in force 11 storm strength wind gusts, taken to safety, while 15 people could not be saved. In total 69 yachts did not finish the race. December 1975 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One Zilvergeest III's Hugh (Barry) Vallance was killed during the 1975 event, despite reasonably good sailing conditions. September 1973 Whitbread Round the World Race Death toll: Three The first race started off from Portsmouth, England on September 8, 1973. Seventeen yachts of various sizes and shapes took part. During the race three sailors were swept over board and died: Paul Waterhouse, Dominique Guillet and Bernie Hosking. Waterhouse and Guillet were never to be seen again.
A Pennsylvania wildlife officer investigating possible poaching was killed during an exchange of gunfire after making a traffic stop late Thursday, authorities said. David L. Grove, 31, was fatally shot in Freedom Township near Gettysburg, according to State Police Commissioner Col. Frank Pawlowski. Authorities detained Christopher Lynn Johnson, 27, early Friday, and were in the processing of bringing charges against him in the case, according to Adams County District Attorney Shawn Wagner. Johnson sustained a gunshot wound and was receiving treatment at a nearby hospital, Pawlowski said. "It is truly a painful day for the Pennsylvania Game Commission," said department spokesman Jerry Feaser. Grove was a "bright, highly educated conservation officer" who graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a degree in wildlife and fisheries science, he said. Grove is the first the game commission officer to be killed in the line of duty since 1915, and only the third since the game commission was founded in 1895.
Flashback to 1984: As a child, I am glued to my family's black-and-white television set for our daily dose of evening entertainment and news on India's national broadcaster. India holds its first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India on November 21, 1963. But this is no ordinary newscast: Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is speaking via videolink with astronaut Rakesh Sharma, who is aboard a space station. Indian pride soared as Squadron Leader Sharma, an Indian Air Force pilot, became the first in the nation to explore the celestial realm, part of a joint mission with what was then the Soviet Union. I don't remember what show it was, but it etched India's "astronomical feat" in the minds of those who watched it, including a 10-year-old like me. But the Indian connection to space was much older than that milestone. In the country's space calendar, November 21, 1963, is a key date: It marks the first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India. Nike-Apache, a two-stage sounding rocket imported from the United States, took off that day from Thumba, a site that eventually became a favorite location for similar experiments by international scientists. So far, there have been some 2,200 sounding-rocket launches from that facility, according to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center. But the South Asian nation's space program has been far more expansive -- the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has more than 60 events that it lists as "milestones" since 1962-63, which includes the successful use of polar and geosynchronous satellite launch vehicles.  See India's space odyssey in photos » Fast forward to 2008: The country launches its first unmanned mission to the Moon in what is being seen as the 21st-Century, Asian version of the space race between the United States and the USSR -- but this time the two nations involved are India and China. In September of that same year, a Chinese astronaut took a spacewalk, his country's first. A month later, India sent Chandrayaan-1 -- Chandrayaan means "moon craft" in Sanskrit -- on a two-year mission to take high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the lunar surface, especially the permanently-shadowed polar regions. The craft, carrying payloads from the United States, the European Union and Bulgaria, will search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks. Nonetheless, India maintains competition does not drive its space program. Vikram Sarabhai, seen as the father of India's space program, made this case for government funding of the program in the 1960s: "We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically-advanced nations in the exploration of the Moon or the planets or manned space-flight," Sarabhai said, according to ISRO's Website. "But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society," said Sarabhai, in what the agency described as a "vision" for India's space endeavors.   Earlier this year, the Indian government increased the federal budget for space research to around $1 billion from some $700 million, ISRO spokesman S. Satish told CNN, as scientists propose to send astronauts into space by 2015 on solely Indian missions. ISRO was also studying the feasibility of sending a manned craft to the Moon by 2020, Satish said, adding that plans for unmanned Mars missions in the coming years have not been finalized. The space agency dropped a TV-sized probe on the Moon last November that it said sent sufficient signals to the mother craft before a crash landing. But the country's space ambitions are not limited to public research endeavors, Satish said. "We have just entered the commercial satellite launch market," he said, including what ISRO noted is now the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites. These satellites, according to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, capture images of the Earth that are used in a range of applications -- agriculture, water resources, urban development, mineral prospecting, environment, forestry, drought and flood forecasting, ocean resources and disaster management. Another major system, or INSAT, is used for communication, television and meteorology. "We have mastered the space technology in these 40 years. We have already sent an unmanned mission to the Moon and now we look forward to sending a manned one there," Satish said.
The hostage situation at Nairobi's Westgate Mall has raised four fundamental issues. These are Kenya's thinking on security, its state of preparedness, state responsiveness and the regional security dimensions. Given the death toll, it is tempting to seek easy answers or adopt quick options, including perhaps withdrawing Kenyan troops from Somalia or scaling back Kenya's role in regional security matters. Kenya has no option but to remain the central cog in the struggle to restore normalcy in Somalia. There are historical reasons for this -- in addition to the fact that Kenyan defense forces are already entrenched in Somalia. For better or worse, history connects Kenya intricately with East Africa in ways that are difficult, if not impossible, to separate. Not only is Kenya the gateway to several East African countries, some of them are Kenya's main trading partners. Read more: Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with Nairobi attack Somalia's security and political history have become a part and parcel of Kenya's socio-economic reality. As an ethnic group, Somalis are separated into five different nations in the horn of Africa. Kenya has citizens of Somali ethnicity living in its north east, a historically marginalized part of the country that at one point preferred an irredentist option. Kenya's poorly policed border with Somalia is over 600 kilometers long. Some Somali are concentrated in Eastleigh estate in Nairobi while many others have spread across Kenya for trade and related purposes. Given the Somali refugee population in Kenya, it is difficult to differentiate citizens from non-citizens with certainty. Indeed, since Kenyan defense forces entered Somalia in October 2011, north-eastern Kenyan towns have experienced the highest number of attacks from Al-Shabaab -- to which there has been minimal government response. Read more: How Al-Shabaab picks its targets This complex regional story is apt for the current metamorphosis and connectedness of global terror networks. Over the years, terror networks have borrowed tactics across regions. Their attacks are increasingly synchronized and Al-Shabaab is no exception to this process. This means that the threat that faces Kenya is real and complex and withdrawal from Somalia is not an option. But can Kenya's response be different? The tendency in counter-terrorism action has been to borrow strategies from other places and deploy them locally. Kenya has borrowed extensively from the United States and relied on Uganda to mount a counter-terror programme in which security is thought of in military and defense terms. Here, the use of extra-judicial force is preferred and replaces intelligence and surveillance. Locally, the police still think of security as synonymous with secrecy. They therefore never mobilize communities as key pillars of intelligence gathering and community support for security provision. Kenya's main challenge is therefore to address the lack of a visible security strategy and/or policy framework. This was apparent in the state of preparedness (or the lack of it) and responsiveness to the attacks at Westgate mall. To be certain, Kenya's security establishment is well organized and impressively presented. The problem is the absence of a clearly articulated security vision and policy framework around which its citizens can collectively rally. Three layers of strategic response must pave the way toward a Kenyan strategy that can potentially deal effectively with Al-Shabaab. Kenya needs to think beyond defense or purely military approaches, to ensure coherent and better use of security apparatus, and to mobilize society around a unifying security consciousness. Read more: Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness Kenya's anti-terrorism plan is heavy with legislative action that anchors the military approach. This is important but hardly sufficient because there is an inherent danger in packaging security bills that polarize society into "us versus them." This is the problem that has stalked Kenyan's proposed anti-terrorism legislation. Civil society and political opposition have contended the proposed law contains provisions that might roll back hard won civil liberties and sanction the profiling of innocent people. This view had a valid basis given the arrest and rendition of people to Uganda where the anti-terror law is more draconian. But such extra-judicial approaches simply lead to a dead-end. The story of the Somali sketched above suggests there is obviously no place to chase "them" away to. Kenya needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats, to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in. This will require intricate work. But Kenya will not be the first country to think in such terms. Other societies have lived through decades of terror and collectively mobilized to challenge it.

Moments after returning from visiting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at the hospital, the congresswoman's six-time campaign chairman said Sunday that he is confident that she will survive, though the extent of her recovery remained unclear. "The doctors are pretty clear that we just have to wait and see," Mike McNulty told CNN in an exclusive interview. The impact on Giffords' family has been huge, he said. Asked how her husband, astronuat Mark Kelly, was faring, McNulty said, "He is a Navy combat fighter and he can take about anything, but this is a terrible experience." Asked about Giffords' ability to survive a 9mm slug to the head, McNulty said, "I can only think that God has more important things planned for her in the future." Even as he acknowledged that the motive for the shooting remains unknown, McNulty faulted Giffords' opponents in last year's elections for stirring up emotions in the campaign to an unacceptable level. "There were rallies around her office that seemed designed to intimidate her staff, which simply doesn't seem very American to me," he said, though he added that he never felt threatened. The rallies were organized by members of the Tea Party around Giffords' support for President Barack Obama's health care bill, he said. "There was a level of vituperation that no one has ever seen, and there was, you know, the famous incident of people showing up with handguns and losing control of handguns that just fall in the street and brandishing handguns." He added, "That's where the Tea Party, I think, went over the edge. They thought it was fun to talk about using your firearms to solve political problems, and I don't think that's fun." Tea Party advocates have condemned Saturday's shootings. "These heinous crimes have no place in America, and they are especially grievous when committed against our elected officials," said Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express. "Spirited debate is desirable in our country, but it only should be the clash of ideas. An attack on anyone for political purposes, if that was a factor in this shooting, is an attack on the democratic process. We join with everyone in vociferously condemning it." McNulty credited Giffords with having a special ability to work from the center with all sides in politics, a strength that served the Democrat well in an overwhelmingly Republican state. "If you look at the demographics, you would not think that she could get elected," he said. "The way she inspires people reminds me a little bit of when I worked for Mo Udall (the former Democratic Arizona congressman) and the people that worked for Ted Kennedy (the late Democratic senator from Massachusetts) -- people who would walk through a wall for the people they believed in. But, unlike them, she doesn't inspire by leading from one of the fringes. "She is a genuine centrist and being inspirational from the center is not that easy, but she can do it and she causes people to just simply love her." CNN's Drew Griffin contributed to this story
and pay. "The atmosphere should always be healthy, friendly and livable. We don't need buyers to tell us that," said Safina Rahman, director of Lakhsmi and one of just a handful of female owners in what is predominantly a male-run industry. "This is my duty. This is how I'd want my children to grow." But in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster when Bangladesh's extremely lucrative garment business has come under increased international scrutiny, Rahman and her workers worry about the effect the backlash will have on them. Retailers in the West are rethinking their partnerships as customers threaten to shop elsewhere. United Students Against Sweatshops, a labor rights group, is planning protests against clothiers it believes aren't committed to strict standards in Bangladesh. And the Obama administration may take away the tax breaks Bangladesh get for goods that the United States imports. The seamstress in the rubble All of which would have devastating consequences for Bangladesh. The garment industry has been a boon for this South Asian nation of 160 million. It pumps $20 billion a year into the economy. In a country where 31% of the population lives below the poverty line, the industry has been a salvation for 4 million people working in more than 4,500 factories. "More than 2 million people are working in this trade; maybe more," Rahman said. "If one (worker) has four people to look after in the family, that's almost 8 million people who are living off this trade." "If we are bloodsuckers, who is contributing to this economy?" she added. "It's become a big-time challenge for us. People like us." Contented workers Poppy Begum is a stitcher here, one of 2,000 workers spread across four floors.  She works nine-hour days, six days a week, helping create sweaters and other knitwear bound for Europe, Canada and Australia. In an industry where the turnover is extremely high, many of the workers such as Begum have been here for almost a decade. It's easy to see why: The starting wage is $51 a month -- higher than the industry average of $35. They are trained in first aid. And they appoint a representative who airs their grievances to management. In other words, the accusations that bedevil the industry now -- safety issues, workers rights, low pay -- are addressed here. "We get paid on time. If Friday is a holiday, we get paid a day earlier," Begum said. We spoke to several workers at Lakhsmi and asked them to speak freely about their conditions. They seemed content. It turns out that medium-sized factories such as this aren't the ones creating the headlines. They are tailored for the task, they meet safety standards and they pass inspections. The problem children are the many, many factories that have mushroomed in and around Dhaka that rent space in facilities where they have no business being: shopping malls or office buildings that aren't equipped to handle the heavy machinery the trade requires. Opinion: Stop cashing in on Bangladeshi workers Fly-by-night operations Until now, the government has turned a blind eye to the problem. After all, the factories were boosting employment -- even if they were doing so in spaces crammed to the hilt with workers with zero safety regulations. Since 2005, almost 2,000 garment workers have been killed in factory fires and structure collapse. And all of them have been at such small, unregulated factories. These facilities don't directly deal with Western clothiers. When a company in the United States places an order, it does so with a large or a medium-sized factory that most likely lives up to the company's standards for a decent wage and working conditions. But, just like a contractor working on your home will farm out parts of the job to others, these factories sometimes do the same -- to smaller, fly-by-night operations. And with business booming, with a greater demand for goods and with the need to keep costs down so the consumers in the West can continue to purchase cheap shirts, such passing-of-the-buck has become more commonplace. Changes afoot? But the Rana Plaza disaster may change all that. The shopping mall in the Dhaka suburb of Savar was built on swampland, with the owner adding four more floors to what was once a five-story structure, officials said. It housed five garment factories and generators on the fourth floor to keep them buzzing. It collapsed April 24, killing more than 1,100 and ranking as the deadliest industrial disaster in the country. The outrage over the disaster reached such a fever pitch that the government said it will form a committee to raise the minimum wage of garment workers. The Cabinet also approved the draft of a law that will allow workers to unionize and force factories to offer life insurance. For its part, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturing and Export Association said it too is taking additional steps. Until now, it had standards for workplace safety but not for the structural safety of a building. "Before this Rana Plaza incident, BGMEA did not have the technical know-how people to check the structural design. We didn't have any civil engineers," said Reza Bin Mahmood, vice president with the association. Those inspections have now begun. But with more than 4,500 factories, the task is daunting. "It's not an easy job. And we cannot finish it by overnight," he said, urging that the factories be improved and updated with money from retailers. Bangladesh vs. U.S.: How much does it cost to make a denim shirt? Spurred to action Some international retailers are doing just that. More than a dozen European clothiers signed on to a plan to help prevent fire and building collapses in Bangladesh. The five-year plan calls for independent safety inspections and for companies to publicly report the findings. It also requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements in factories with which they work. Companies who sign on will have to terminate business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety upgrades. But many U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart, have not signed on. Wal-Mart said it will perform its own inspections and provide every worker with fire safety. Over at Lakhsmi, the changes for the industry are welcome ones. Here, workers are assigned as fire wardens and extinguishers hang on the walls on each floor. "At times, I feel ashamed to be in this trade," Rahman, the factory owner, said. "Not for me but (because) somebody from this trade has done this irresponsible thing and took so many lives. "This is just not done. It should not be repeated again."

Rapper T.I. was arrested on federal gun charges just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards, according to federal authorities. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta. The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested in a federal sting Saturday after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement. Authorities said that Harris, 27, provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon. Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past. However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said Sunday he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that "a number of people" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were "two sides to every story -- sometimes three" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor. The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. ET Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was filmed. Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. The show went on without the self-proclaimed "King of the South," whose car and College Park, Georgia, home were searched following his arrest.  Watch a search of the rapper's home » Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, "including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console." At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. "Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated," said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. "The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns." The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement. The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said. The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said. On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said. Harris was supposed to pick up the guns after meeting the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said. Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation. "Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms," according to an affidavit. Harris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as "trap musik," the name of Harris' second album. A "trap" is Southern slang for a drug house. Harris will be held in federal custody over the weekend and will appear Monday before a magistrate judge, the Justice Department statement said. Harris soon will appear in the movie "American Gangster," starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The film is set to open November 2.

With three police officers dead and two others wounded, Justin Bourque had finally admitted "I'm done" and given up. Two months later, he made it official. The 24-year-old Canadian man pleaded guilty Friday to three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, his lawyer David Lutz said. He is set to be sentenced October 27. Bourque's submission stands in contrast to the brazen relentlessness he showed in June, when he embarked on a grisly rampage through Moncton, New Brunswick, some 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of Saint John. The carnage prompted people to shutter themselves in their houses and barricades to spring up around Moncton, a city of 140,000 people that had no homicides at all in 2011 and 2012. It ended early June 7, when Bourque was arrested after yelling through a window, a nearby resident told CNN partner CBC. "They (police) were screaming for about five minutes and they had their guns loaded," the resident, Michelle Thibodeau, told CBC. "And eventually Justin came out with his hands up and he yelled, 'I'm done.' And they collected him and brought him to my front yard, where he lay sprawled out. " The slain Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers were Constables David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40. Why did Bourque do it? A Facebook page that purportedly belongs to him has many posts with pro-gun photos and a few anti-police memes. There is also a photo where two men pose with shotguns in the snow. It was posted on February 25, six days after the Facebook page was created, and is used as the profile picture. According to CBC, the judge at Borque's hearing Friday told the defendant he could be facing consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole for 75 years for the three first-degree murder charges.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry called on the Obama administration Monday to deploy more resources to the United States' border with Mexico, two days after a bullet -- likely from a gun battle between drug traffickers and Mexican police -- struck an El Paso building. It's the second time in two months that bullets from shootouts across the border have strayed into Texas, Perry said. "By the grace of God, the stray bullets from these incidents have yet to injure or kill a Texan," he said. "It is unconscionable that the Obama administration is gambling with American lives, betting that escalating violence from these cartels won't eventually shed the blood of innocent people on U.S. soil." In Saturday's incident, a bullet struck a building on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso, the university's President Diana Natalicio said. No injuries were reported at the school. That same evening, a "major gun battle" between drug traffickers and Mexican authorities broke out in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, just 30 yards from the U.S. border at El Paso, a U.S. Border Patrol spokesman said. Three police officers were injured and one armed suspect was killed in the clash, Mexican federal police spokesman Ramon Salinas said. The bullet found at the university likely came from the shootout, border patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said. "We must ensure El Paso and other border communities remain a safe place for people to live, work and raise a family," Perry said. "It's time for Washington to stop the rhetoric and immediately deploy a [significant] force of personnel and resources to the border to protect our homeland." During Saturday's clash, U.S. authorities blocked off a four-mile section of Paisano Street, which runs parallel to the Rio Grande, the international border. Cordero said the closing was the first time authorities have been forced to take such action due to activity across the border. Natalicio said the university will consult with law enforcement and government officials about possible further security precautions. Cordero said his agency doesn't plan to change its security methods, saying border patrol agents are still maintaining the integrity of the border and operating as usual. The shootout took place less than two months after shots fired from a gun battle originating in Juarez crossed into El Paso and hit City Hall, damaging the building. CNN's Nick Valencia and Rick Martin contributed to this report.
Hundreds filled a small-town Michigan church on a chilly and overcast Tuesday to say a final goodbye to a teenage hero who died just after scoring a winning shot that lifted his high school's basketball team to a perfect winning season. Friends and family paid their last respects at a funeral for 16-year-old Wes Leonard of Fennville. The night before, his teammates charged into a gym, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with his number -- 35 -- and the phrase, "Never forgotten." Fans erupted in a standing ovation and wiped away tears during a moment of silence before the tipoff of Fennville High School's first game without Leonard as the point guard. The Blackhawks won their first state playoff game, 65-54,  before a crowd of thousands. "This was a game he would like to watch. There's no doubt his eyes were upon us," Fennville coach Ryan Klingler told reporters, choking back tears. Friends came to the game with homemade shirts and signs, saying he was their angel on the court, CNN affiliate WZZM reported. The teen's parents sat in the sold-out crowd of nearly 3,500 people. His brother sat beside teammates on the bench. "Wes was like a brother to us," Fennville player Xavier Grigg told WZZM. "We were all like family. We knew he would have wanted us to come out here and keep the streak alive." Leonard died moments after scoring the winning basket in overtime Thursday, securing a perfect season for the Blackhawks. He scored his team's last four points in the 57-55 victory. An autopsy Friday revealed Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, according to a statement from Dr. David A. Start, the Ottawa County chief medical examiner.
The woman who scrambled to safety after a small plane crashed into her Florida home gave thanks to God on Saturday for allowing her to escape without a scratch and for keeping her family safe. Susan Crockett stood in front of her one-story Palm Coast home, which now has a huge black hole where the four-seater plane went down Friday afternoon, killing all three people aboard. "God is good. He really is," Crockett told reporters. "I got out without a scratch on me. A little bruise from taking a tumble through the window, but other than that, I'm fine. I'm blessed. Truly, God was with me." The 1957 Bonanza H35 took off from Fort Pierce, Florida, and was on its way to Knoxville when the pilot reported engine trouble, officials said. "From what we've been told, the pilot was having some malfunctions in flight," said Chief Investigator Terry Duprie of the National Transportation Safety Board. The plane was diverting to Flagler County Airport, near the coast about 30 miles north of Daytona Beach, when it crashed a mile east of the airport, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said. Killed in the crash were Michael R. Anders, 57, and Duane L. Shaw, 59, both of Albany, Kentucky, and Charissee M. Peoples, 42, of Indianapolis, Indiana, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A preliminary NTSB report on the crash is expected in about 10 days, Duprie said, but the full investigation is expected to take many months. Investigators will try to figure out why the plane made such a steep descent into the home and whether the weather conditions -- light rain and low clouds -- played any role, he said. Tall pine trees surround the home, which is in a rural residential area home to many retirees. The crash caused an intense fire that incinerated much of the plane, something that will make the investigation difficult, Duprie said. But the pilot was talking to air traffic controllers in Daytona Beach, "and I think that will help us out quite a bit down the road." Crockett said she was getting ready to leave her house when something told her to stop. A few more feet, she said, and she would have been hit. Her college-age daughter, Jessica, who was home for the holidays, would have been lounging on a bed that's now "charred and mangled" if she hadn't decided to head back to school a few days early, Crockett said. Crockett's grandson often comes over to her house, where "he stands in front of the television that's now a big glob of metal," but his dad decided to take him to day care Friday, she said. Members of Crockett's church bought her clothes and shoes to wear, since she escaped the house with next to nothing. She did manage to rescue the folded flag she received after her sister, who was in the Army, died about three years ago. It's blackened, but intact, she said. "I'm just praising God that I'm alive," Crockett said Saturday.
A federal judge has allowed Arizona to enforce the most controversial part of its politically charged immigration law, the so-called "show me your papers" provision. In an order on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton upheld the section allowing authorities, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people who may be in the United States illegally. The Supreme Court in June tossed out most other aspects of the tough new law but said the part known by critics as the "show me your papers" provision could go into effect, at least for now. The hot-button immigration issue is a major attack line in this year's presidential campaign with Republicans, led by Mitt Romney, accusing President Barack Obama of failing to devise a comprehensive strategy to deal with illegal immigration. Arizona is the nation's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling. The Justice Department said Arizona's population of two million Latinos includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally, and 60% to 70% of deportations or "removals" involve Mexican nationals. The Pew Hispanic Center recently issued a report that found that Mexican immigration to the United States has come to a standstill. However, the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants -- from Mexico and other countries -- continue to live in the United States. Bolton's decision was in response to a suit that followed the Supreme Court ruling by a number of individuals and civil rights groups who said enforcement would lead to racial profiling. It would be up to Arizona to decide when to enforce the measure and there was no sign that would occur immediately. It was not clear if the coalition of civil rights groups and individuals would appeal Tuesday's ruling or wait to see how the law is enforced. What's next in the Arizona immigration battle? "There is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced," said Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in late June, making clear that Arizona authorities must comply with federal law in conducting the immigration status checks or face further constitutional challenges. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican who led the fight to pass the overall law, applauded the latest court order, saying it gives law enforcement "one more tool" to use "in collaborating with federal authorities to reduce the crime and other impacts associated with illegal immigration." She said the law "must be enforced efficiently, effectively and in harmony with the Constitution and civil rights." The American Civil Liberties Union, which had asked Bolton to block the provision, said it was prepared to continue challenging the law by documenting instances of racial profiling throughout the state, Alessandra Soler, executive director of the legal group in Arizona, said in a statement. The Supreme Court struck down other challenged parts of the Arizona law, upholding the broad authority of the federal government to set immigration policy and laws. Among provisions tossed by the high court was a measure that authorized police to arrest illegal immigrants without a warrant where "probable cause" existed that they committed a public offense making them removable from the country. The Arizona law generated immediate controversy after it was signed by Brewer in April 2010, prompting an Obama administration challenge. Supporters of the Arizona measure contend the federal government has failed to enforce existing immigration laws, leaving it to states to take their own steps to deal with mounting economic and social problems caused by illegal immigrants. Administration officials have said the Department of Homeland Security expects increased requests from Arizona police to check the immigration status of suspects. However, they said the department will get involved only in high-priority cases. Several other states followed Arizona's lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants. Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia, Alabama, Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. Arizona's appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court. At issue was whether states have any authority to step in to regulate immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government. In dry legal terms, this constitutional issue is known as pre-emption. The district court case is U.S. v. Arizona (10-cv-1413).

The Indiana State Fair reopened Monday with a public memorial service for five people killed when a concert stage collapsed during a storm. The fairgrounds were closed Saturday night following the accident, which occurred shortly before the country music duo Sugarland was to take the stage before an audience of about 12,000. "While we will never forget this horrific event and those who perished, may we Hoosiers find the courage to unify, rebuild and re-emerge with a stronger heart," said Indiana first lady Cheri Daniels, who attended Saturday's concert and was one of several speakers at Monday's ceremony. Audience members at the service honored victims with a moment of silence and later sang "Amazing Grace." Officials Monday were focusing on grieving with victims and beginning repairs to get the fair back underway, Gov. Mitch Daniels told CNN. "Our first instinct in Indiana is not to go rushing around, looking for scapegoats. It's to take care of business, take care of those who've been hurt and then, of course ... study to see if something could have done better and learn any necessary lessons," he said. On Sunday he described the stage's collapse as a "freakish accident." "I'm not saying that we're not going to find many things that could have been done differently," Daniels told CNN Monday. "I'm only saying that I know the people who run this operation. They think safety all the time, and I know that their hearts are broken that, in this case, this event took place as it did." Investigators on Sunday sifted through debris of the stage, trying to determine what caused the accident that also injured at least 40 people, authorities said. Metal scaffolding fell onto the "Sugarpit," a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most ardent fans, about four minutes after authorities took the stage to warn the crowd to seek shelter, according to a timeline of events released by investigators Sunday. Forecasters had warned heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through Saturday. The National Weather Service estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph. Video shows the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way, sending a heavy bank of stage lights and metal onto fans closest to the outdoor stage. The Atlanta-based Sugarland group -- along with its opening act, Sara Bareilles -- canceled their scheduled performance Sunday at the Iowa State Fair. According to the fair's website, "aside from coping with the magnitude of the accident, the ongoing investigation prevents the band from getting what may remain of their stage equipment." Jennifer Nettles, one half of the Sugarland duo, posted a statement on the group's website Sunday, saying "there are no words to process a moment of this magnitude and gravity." "There are only prayers for peace in the hearts of the bereft, and prayers of thanksgiving for those who were spared or safe. A piece of our heart is left in that grandstand," Nettles said. Bareilles, who had just finished her performance when the collapse occurred, tweeted Sunday she was "still thinking of all those affected." On her website, she wrote: "The accident at the Indiana State Fair felt like a bad dream. The weather changed in a matter of minutes and the stage collapsed in a matter of seconds. " She called the emergency response "incredibly quick." While most of the injured were treated and released from Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital, nine patients were admitted and were still being treated Sunday afternoon, the hospital said. Three children remained at Riley Hospital for Children, the hospital said. "We're all very much in mourning of the loss of the victims, and we are praying with their families," Cindy Hoye, the fair's executive director said. The Marion County, Indiana, coroner identified the three women and two men who died as: Tammy Vandam, 42, of Wanatah, Indiana; Glenn Goodrich, 49, of Indianapolis; Alina Bigjohny, 23, of Fort Wayne, Indiana; Christina Santiago, 29, of Chicago; and Nathan Byrd, 51, of Indianapolis. Vandam, Goodrich, Bigjohny and Santiago were dead at the scene, while Byrd died later at the hospital, the coroner said. Friends, colleagues and family gathered Sunday to remember Santiago at Chicago's Howard Brown Health Center, a health care organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, where she worked. "We have lost a fierce warrior, an amazing activist," said Rosa Yadira Ortiz, board president for Amigas Latinos, a group for lesbian Hispanics in Chicago that Santiago was involved in. "She really brought us all together." The families of two of those hospitalized released brief statements Sunday, each asking for prayers and privacy. "Jenny Haskell, a 22-year-old Ball State senior, is very critical at this time," her family said. A fifth-grader, identified only as Jade, is in critical condition, according to her family. Allison Hoehn, a concertgoer, said many attendees rushed to those trapped after the stage crumbled. "We tried to get down to help, but no one was moving," Hoehn said. "The storm came on so fast and the stage just snapped like a toothpick." Spectators grabbed parts of their seats to assemble makeshift stretchers, she said. "Everyone rushed to help, and we saw people searching and pulling people out," Hoehn said. Dust swirled just before a gust of wind rushed in and the stage crashed down, concertgoer Jenna Gioe told CNN Monday. "It was absolute pandemonium" as crowds rushed to get out of the grandstand, she said. Days after the stage collapse, Gioe said she was still struggling to understand the tragic turn of events. "It's absolutely baffling ... What actually happened, it's beyond all of us," she said. CNN's Alan Duke, Chelsea J. Carter, Leslie Tripp and David Williams contributed to this report.
She's traveled more than 35,000 kilometers hugging the equator, powered entirely by the sun. PlanetSolar, the world's largest solar powered boat, recently stopped off in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor as part of its 18-month journey around the world. Measuring 31 meters (102 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide, the catamaran is powered by 537-square meters of photovoltaic solar panels. On a sunny day they produce on average 94 kilowatts of power -- the equivalent to 127 horsepower. Seventy-five percent of the energy propels the boat that travels between 5 and 10 knots an hour. The remainder is used for everything else from flushing toilets to operating the boat's navigational systems. PlanetSolar is the brainchild of 39-year-old Swiss Raphael Domjan. While hiking in Iceland, the former ambulance driver was alarmed to see how quickly the glaciers were melting and decided to find a novel way to raise awareness of global warming. "If we can go out on the road with this boat, it's a huge boat, only on solar energy, and we live on this boat, everything is working the computer, the telephone, everything is on solar energy. It means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday," Domjan said. Built in Germany at the cost of $26 million dollars, this vessel tracks the sun thanks to state-of-the-art solar technology. "We can travel around three days with no light," explains Christian Ochsenbein, chief engineer aboard the boat. "But usually there is light everyday even if it's raining. So when we come in a bad weather situation we can expand this time, we reduce this speed and we sail for about 5 days before we run out of battery," he added. Planet Solar set sail from Monaco in September 2010 crossing the Atlantic, the Panama Canal and is currently in the Pacific. Next stop is Singapore. It will then travel across the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal before finally returning to the Mediterranean where it plans to dock back in Monaco in May next year. French captain, Erwann Le Rouzic (one of six crew members on board), says that while the technology has been faultless, Mother Nature has proven to be a challenge. "When you cross to the south of the planet you always find rain, strong winds and big waves, so we passed all this with lots of patience and humility, because you are always humble against bad weather," Le Rouzic explains. In every port, the catamaran and its message has been warmly received. It's hoped the shipping industry -- responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations -- embraces this technology the same way the public has. "One day we won't have any more oil anywhere. Maybe it's in 50,100, 200 years but one day we will have no more oil and we'll have to find another way to live," Domjan said. And if Planet Solar completes its mission, the crew says that will be proof that the sun, and solar power, is the answer.
The strongest contender to become the next Pakistani prime minister is hardly a newcomer to the country's political stage. Nawaz Sharif, 63, has had a long and rocky career that includes two stints as prime minister during the 1990s, ordering Pakistan's first nuclear tests, a showdown with the nation's powerful military, time in jail and years of exile. After spending the past several years in opposition to the governing Pakistani People's Party (PPP) -- which has struggled to tackle the country's crippling problems of militant violence, chronic power shortages and a flagging economy -- Sharif now has a shot at another stint in office. But observers say his positions on key issues such as Islamic extremists and relations with the United States remain vague, raising uncertainty about what kind of approach he would take if his Pakistani Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) were to succeed in forming a government in the national assembly following general elections this weekend. There is also concern about his relationship with the military's top generals, who still maintain a strong influence on Pakistan's foreign and security policies. Interventions by the military ended Sharif's terms as prime minister in 1999 when Pervez Musharraf, the head of the army at the time, overthrew him in a coup. In a dramatic fall from grace, Sharif ended up in jail, convicted of hijacking charges for trying to stop a plane carrying Musharraf from landing. He then went into exile in Saudi Arabia and didn't return to Pakistan until 2007, when he teamed up with the PPP to force Musharraf from office. "It's a big question whether he can coexist with the military," said Zahid Hussain, a veteran Pakistani journalist and author. "He hasn't forgiven or forgotten what happened to him." All about the economy Sharif's campaign has focused on the economy, which seems to matter the most to many Pakistanis. The nation ranks 146th out of 186 countries in the United Nations' human development index, a measure of living standards, health and education. Under the slogan "Strong Economy -- Strong Pakistan," Sharif is playing to his image as a flag-bearer for private industry and entrepreneurship. Part of a prominent industrial family, he took steps to liberalize the economy during his time in office in the 1990s through measures such as privatizing state-run companies. "Generally, the business lobby has more confidence in his ability to fix the economy and solve some of the trickier problems, particularly the energy crisis," said Raza Rumi, director of policy and programs at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani research organization. His party has built conspicuous infrastructure projects in recent years in its political stronghold of Punjab, which is home to more than half of Pakistan's 180 million people and the biggest source of elected seats in the National Assembly. It's also the country's industrial and agricultural heartland. The Taliban question While his economic credentials appear stronger than those of his main rivals, critics have picked up on his apparent reluctance to take a strong line against violent extremists, notably the Pakistani Taliban, who have carried out relentless, bloody attacks in the area bordering Afghanistan. "He criticizes terrorism, he criticizes the use of force, but he will not criticize a specific organization by name," said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst focused on defense issues. "He will not criticize the Pakistani Taliban by name." Sharif was not available for an interview for this article. But Irfanullah Khan Marwat, a veteran Pakistani politician who recently joined the PML-N, said that the party is in favor of holding talks with the Taliban. "We as a party oppose extremism, we oppose bloodshed," Marwat said. "And we think any and every solution lies with who is sitting across a table and coming to an understanding." The politics of fear Sharif's party's cautious stance on the Taliban and other militant groups results from political expediency and fear, according to Rumi, who is also the editor of The Friday Times, a weekly newspaper. Religious conservatives, some of whom sympathize with extremist groups, make up an important part of Sharif's core vote, Rumi said. During his time in office in the 1990s, Sharif caused alarm among more secular-minded Pakistanis by pushing through legislation that sought to introduce aspects of Sharia law. And since the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during campaigning for the 2008 elections, a lot of Pakistani politicians are afraid of well-organized, merciless militants like the Taliban, according to Rumi. The killing of Bhutto is still being investigated by authorities, but the Taliban and other militant groups have between them carried out dozens of deadly attacks on campaigners for the current elections. Uncertainty over relations with U.S. An unwillingness to continue the fight against insurgents could put a Sharif government at loggerheads with the military and also strain already difficult relations with the United States, a key prop for Pakistan's shaky public finances. Sharif has openly questioned Pakistani-involvement in the American-led "war on terror." But observers note he may adapt his approach if he becomes prime minister. "He had good working relations with the United States in previous terms," Rizvi said. "My feeling is he will still have good relations. Once he gets into power, then he has to change." For its part, the United States says it has no preferred contender in the elections. "We do not support any particular political party or any individual candidate, and we look forward to engaging the next democratically elected government of Pakistan," Patrick Ventrell, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said last week. A new approach to New Delhi? Sharif has also raised eyebrows by vowing to improve ties with Pakistan's archrival, India. The two nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars since their partition at the end of British colonial rule. One of those wars, in 1999, led to the military coup that drove Sharif out of office. In a recent interview with the Indian broadcaster CNN-IBN, Sharif said he would carry out an investigation into the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which killed more than 160 people. India blames the Pakistan-based group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for carrying out the attacks, accusing Islamabad of not doing enough to pursue its members. The group has denied responsibility. Democratic progress If a new Pakistani government is successfully formed from the elections this weekend, it will be the first time in Pakistan's history that the country has democratically transitioned from one elected administration to another. One of the reasons for that, analysts say, is that Sharif and his party took a pragmatic approach to being in opposition, despite their differences with the governing PPP and its leader, President Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower. It's a far cry from the 1990s, when Sharif and Bhutto worked constantly to undermine each other's governments, resulting in instability and interference from the military. The 21st-century Sharif, mindful of his overthrow and exile, appears more committed to upholding democratic, civilian government and not providing the military with an excuse to step in, according to Rumi. "That by itself was a very promising development," he said. The trouble with coalitions The big question, however, is how effective any government that emerges from the elections will be. Although several opinion polls have put Sharif's party in front, a great deal of uncertainty remains over how many seats it will end up with in the assembly. Observers say there's a strong chance that both parties will fall short of an overall majority, resulting in a scramble to form a coalition with smaller parties. The most prominent and potentially game-changing of the smaller parties is cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), a new player in national elections. Analysts are finding it hard to predict how many seats PTI candidates might secure, especially after Khan was seriously injured in a fall at a campaign rally this week. If his party wins enough seats, the former captain of the Pakistani cricket team could find himself the kingmaker in its parliament. But any coalition government may struggle to formulate strong policies on the critical issues Pakistan faces, even under an established figure like Sharif. That could leave other institutions with room to exert their influence. "Theoretically, the prime minister is in charge," Rumi said. "In practice, the military is more powerful."

Lindsay Lohan failed a court-ordered alcohol test last week, requiring her to go before a judge for a probation violation hearing Thursday morning, according to a source close to the case. Lohan's failed test, which the source said happened on June 13, comes while the actress is confined to her Venice Beach, California home because of a jail sentence imposed last month. The actress will appear before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner at 10 a.m. Thursday, the same judge who sentenced her to 120 days in jail after she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace, a prosecution spokeswoman said Wednesday. Lohan was allowed to serve a reduce sentence at home because, as a non-violent offender, she qualified a home confinement program intended to reduce overcrowding. But it is not likely Judge Sautner has missed seeing media reports showing Lohan socializing on the roof of her luxury home in recent days. "When my friends come over, they're not drinking," Lohan told an interviewer with Life & Style magazine. "Alcohol is not in my house, so it's just not a part of my life." That interview was given on June 18, five days after she failed test. The actress, who turns 25 on July 2, has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunk driving convictions, a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction. "Because of budget constraints and because we're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation, nonviolent offenders, lesser crimes, get 20% of their sentence," Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Without the latest violation, it was expected she would be released from home confinement in early July. She would then resume her work on 480 hours of community service the judge imposed. Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge, but Sautner made it clear in court last month that she didn't think drugs and alcohol were not the root of Lohan's legal troubles. "She's got other problems for which she self-medicates," Judge Sautner said. Lohan's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007. Since then, she's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehabilitation programs. A probation report released last month said the actress "appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues." "It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines.

For more than a month, a U.S. Marine and Afghanistan war veteran has been held in a Tijuana, Mexico, prison, fighting for his release after being charged with a crime he says he did not commit. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi said he accidentally crossed into Mexico around 10 p.m. on March 31 with three personal firearms while on his way to meet friends in San Ysidro, California. Tahmooressi, 25, had recently moved to the area to get treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder and was "essentially living out of his truck," his mother, Jill, told CNN. He is currently being held in the La Mesa penitentiary in Tijuana on a weapons charge and awaits a May 28 court date, according to the Mexican attorney general's office. "I accidentally drove into Mexico with 3 guns ... a rifle (AR-15), a .45 cal pistol and a 12 gauge pump shotgun with no intensions (sic) on being in Mexico or being involved in any criminal activities," Tahmooressi wrote in a statement of innocence to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter. "I have rights to all 3 weapons. They are under my name ... Please help me." Hunter, a California Republican, is among several lawmakers who have recently begun petitioning for Tahmooressi's release. Last week, Hunter wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, urging him to get involved. Also, in a bipartisan congressional letter addressed to Mexico's attorney general on May 8, Hunter wrote: "Mexico's Attorney General is in a position to deal with Andrew's case and ensure its quick resolution ... it is necessary that the AG intervene and expedite proceedings at the very least.  And so far there's been no validation from Mexico that Andrew didn't make a directional mistake at the border." The Mexican attorney general's office confirmed Tahmooressi's arrest on a weapons charge but could not offer more details about his case. "Mother's Day is Sunday. If I can have my baby home on Sunday, that would be the greatest gift a mother could ever ask for," Jill Tahmooressi said in an interview from Miami. "The brutality of being ... unjustly in a foreign prison is worse than any experience I had with him serving two tours in Afghanistan," she said. "He was willing to die for his country as a Marine. Where is his country now when he needs it the most?" It is difficult for the U.S. State Department to quantify how many arrests are due to accidental crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, a spokeswoman told CNN, but Andrew Tahmooressi's case is not all that unique. In 2012, former Marine Jon Hammar was on his way to a surfing trip with friends when he was arrested while carrying an antique shotgun across the Mexican border checkpoint in Brownsville, Texas. His mother told CNN that her son was arrested and held for more than three months even though he had registered his weapon with U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents before his trip. "The press coverage led to his release," Olivia Hammar said in a phone interview. "It's an illegitimate (court) process (in Mexico). There's no oral arguments. You're guilty until you're proven innocent. Unfortunately, the only way to deal with that is ... if the (U.S.) State Department is not going to do something about it, then you have to go to the public and force them to do something about it. In our case, that's what moved things along." In a daily press briefing this week, CNN asked State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki about Tahmooressi's case, but she declined to comment, citing "privacy concerns." Meanwhile, Tahmooressi's family is determined to secure his release. In the weeks since his arrest, they have held rallies across the United States, done media interviews and promoted a whitehouse.gov petition to draw attention to his imprisonment. "The affect (sic) of this unjust incarceration on a decorated combat Marine is despairing," the petition said. As of Thursday evening, it had garnered nearly 12,500 signatures, about 87,500 short of the 100,000 required to get a response from the White House.
Pakistan's foreign ministry Wednesday rejected concerns raised by the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief that the country's nuclear weapons "could fall into the hands of an extremist group in Pakistan or in Afghanistan." Mohamed ElBaradei, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief. fears for Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Mohamed ElBaradei's comments to Al-Hayat newspaper were "irresponsible" and "unwarranted," foreign ministry spokesman Mohammed Sadiq said at a news briefing on Wednesday. "Pakistan rejects the statement by Dr. ElBaradei, Director General IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), hinting at the possibility of its nuclear weapons falling into the hands of extremists," according to a ministry statement. "As head of the IAEA, which is a U.N. body, he has to be careful about his statements which ought to remain within the parameters of his mandate. "His remarks also ignore the fact that the strategic assets of Pakistan are fully secure and under multilayered safeguards and controls exercised by the National Command Authority." In an interview published in Al-Hayat Tuesday, ElBaradei said that Pakistan's recent political instability makes it more sensitive to susceptible to problems in other Muslim countries. "The effects of any new war in the Middle East and the Islamic world could have repercussions, not only in Iran, but what I fear most is the effect in Pakistan, a nation with many internal problems," ElBaradei said. "I fear a system of chaos or extremist regime in this state, which has 30 or 40 nuclear weapons." Pakistan has been in a state of political upheaval since the country's opposition challenged President Pervez Musharraf's tight grip on power, pushing him to step down as military chief and lift the emergency rule he had imposed in early November. The country further spiraled into chaos after the December 27 assassination of leading opposition figure and former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. In response to the IAEA director-general's comments, Pakistan's foreign ministry stressed in its statement that ElBaradei, "on several occasions, has been briefed about the structure and control mechanisms put in place to ensure complete safety of our nuclear assets." "Pakistan is a responsible nuclear weapon state. Our nuclear weapons are as secure as that of any other nuclear weapon state. We, therefore, believe statements expressing concern about their safety and security are unwarranted and irresponsible. "Pakistan attaches great importance to IAEA and has extended cooperation and assistance to the Agency on many important issues towards the fulfillment of its mandate. Our civilian nuclear program is under IAEA safeguards and we have always fully complied with IAEA obligations," the ministry said. E-mail to a friend
In watching Mitt Romney's painful -- and self-destructive -- gaffe about the "47 percenters," it at first seemed inexplicable, as if the man was writing off half of the electorate. Never mind that the self-declared "victims" he's talking about include seniors (who actually voted Republican in 2010) and veterans (many of whom might be inclined to vote for the GOP). Or that they're also people who work hard and pay their payroll taxes, and might be getting some tax benefits for their children. So what is it about Mitt Romney, who should know these things -- and probably does -- that makes him so gaffe-prone? Another way to ask the question: Why does a smart man say such stupid things? iReport: I'm the 47% but - You're WRONG Mitt Romney! I have a theory about this. In spending a lot of time this year thinking about Romney -- and speaking with those who know him the best, politically and personally while reporting a CNN documentary -- this much appears to be true: Romney has a businessman's approach to politics. Which means: He sizes up a situation (or an audience). He figures out what he needs to do to cut the deal. Then he does it, and expects it to work. Ergo, Romney speaks to a group of conservative GOP fat cats, and tells them what he thinks they want to hear so they will cough up the dough. Belief is almost beside the point. He was closing the deal. Here's something to know: While Romney was born into politics, he's not a natural-born politician. His father may have been a three-term Michigan governor, but he told his son to go into business first. So he did. And now Romney is a numbers guy who came to the ideological part of politics late. And it shows, especially when you are asking voters to trust what you believe to become president. Some politicians are hatched out of strong loyalty to a cause or a party. Romney is a businessman who came to politics out of a strong sense of duty -- and belief in his own ability to repair what's broken. Getting elected is what you have to do so you can do what you're good at: fixing things. (In an odd way, kind of like President Obama, who also believes getting elected is what you have to do so you can do what you're good at: transforming things.) Romney has had much success painting the self-portrait as a Mr. Fix-it. While he couldn't defeat Ted Kennedy, he did become the governor of the liberal state of Massachusetts in 2002, running as a pro-choice moderate. Opinion: How Romney really feels about Republicans Once in office, though, when confronted with the difficult issue of abortion -- and looking at a presidential bid in the ever more conservative GOP -- he flipped, explaining to me that it was a matter of conscience, tempered by the reality of political power. "I realized what sounded good in a campaign, when I actually became the governor and would be the person who would sign a piece of legislation which could take human life -- I simply couldn't do that," he told me. But there's no doubt about it: Romney had to move to the right to try and get the nomination, so he did in the 2008 campaign. And he did it again in 2012. In trying to explain Romney's jujitsu, former adviser Alex Castellanos told me that Romney's journey on social issues was the journey of a businessman who "mainly looked at governing as an economic proposition, all of a sudden confronting some social issues as a mature adult responsible for human life. And so he did evolve there." Fast-forward to the "severely conservative" candidate of the 2012 primaries. And to the latest fundraiser chat in which Romney says half of the American public believes it has been victimized, and the government needs to take care of them. CNNMoney: Romney's '47% All of which leads to this question: Does Romney believe any of this stuff? In the end, it's hard to know. But I'll subscribe to a theory advanced by David Brooks in The New York Times today: that Romney is a "decent man who says stupid things because he is pretending to be something he is not -- some sort of cartoonish government-hater." Maybe that's what Romney thought he needed to be to cut the deal. But the problem is, presidential politics isn't just business. It's personal.

(CNN)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will soon add Miami Seaquarium's killer whale, Lolita, to the endangered species list, but nothing will change for the longtime Miami entertainer. At 49, the senior whale will be added to the endangered listing for the Southern Resident Killer Whales found in the waters off Seattle, where Lolita was captured in 1970. The Southern Resident population was depleted between 1965 and 1975 because of captures conducted for marine parks, according to NOAA Fisheries.  The population's numbers remain low due to such environmental factors as pollution, oil spills and noise from passing vessels, NOAA says. As a result, the Southern Resident killer whales were added to the endangered species 10 years ago. Animal activists, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Animal Legal Defense Fun and the Orca Network see this ruling as a victory. "It's Lolita's chance of freedom," said Jared Goodman, PETA's director of animal law. "It's a huge step." Activists petitioned NOAA to include Lolita to the Southern Resident endangered list, saying they never had the right to separate her from designation for the Seattle killer whale population. About 17,000 comments were submitted to the federal agency in support of the endangered designation for Lolita. Animal rights activists want Lolita eventually released back into the wild if she can be rehabilitated to survive on her own after 40 years of captivity where she is hand-fed instead of capturing her own food. Websites such as SaveLolita (savelolita.org) and protests like one in Miami where hundreds marched for the release of Lolita. Activists say they have a plan to move Lolita from Miami to a privately owned cove at San Juan Island in Washington. There, Lolita could be rehabilitated from captivity and taught to forage for her own food, says Goodman. The activists admit Lolita might never survive a release in the open ocean for a number of reasons. Keiko, from the movie "Free Willy," died only three years after being returned to the ocean. Miami Seaquarium says Lolita's is not going anywhere. "Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," says Robert Rose, Miami Seaquarium Curator. "Lolita is healthy and thriving in her home, where she shares her habitat with Pacific white-sided dolphins," who perform two shows daily says the curator. Rose and NOAA say the endangered designation does not required the killer whale to be released back into the wild. Plus any such movement of a killer whale would need a NOAA Fishery permit and extensive review. "We are going to do everything to protect her (Lolita)," said the PETA attorney. That would include suing anyone who harms the endangered killer whale. What constitutes harm could ultimately be decided by a federal judge. Miami Seaquarium is one of the oldest marine parks in the United States, and activists say Lolita's  habitat is not big enough. They are suing the federal government for not enforcing the minimum size requirement. But the USDA tells the Seaquarium that the park exceeds minimum size requirements for the pool. PETA says even if Lolita can't be rehabilitated to return to the wild, the Washington state cove is much larger and her former killer whale pods will swim by her open water habitat. The Miami Seaquarium curator says there's no proof Lolita could survive in such a habitat. "It would be reckless to treat her life as an experiment and jeopardize her health and safety." Opinion: Can a killer whale be a slave?
Another day, another mass shooting in America. More blood, more tears, more knee-jerk rhetoric about finding a solution for a bunch of different problems. Those who knew Aaron Alexis -- the shooter who killed 12 and injured eight more at the Washington Navy Yard this week -- said he was a quiet, shy man. At one point he was studying Buddhism and meditated often. A little more digging, and we find he had several gun-related arrests and a pattern of misconduct in the Navy, but he was honorably discharged. Pieces of a puzzle we may never fully put together. But the fact that there is still so much we don't know about Alexis -- or the motive behind the shootings -- won't detour gun-control advocates from lumping his story in with that of Adam Lanza, the man police say is responsible for the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with the victims from gang- and drug-related shootings. This is why after the tears have dried and the blood washes away, little, if anything, will change. And because gun-control advocates so often try to cobble together every distinct narrative involving guns into a one-size-fits-all conversation, they are as much to blame for this merry-go-round as the gun lobbyists against whom they fight. Gun shops are illegal in Chicago. Opinion: What could have prevented carnage? The city has bans on both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And yet each week people continue to die in the streets from gunshot wounds. This conundrum is just one example why making note that more Americans have died from gun violence here at home since Newtown than in the nine years fighting a war in Iraq is the kind of factoid that grabs our attention but undermines the true goal: curtailing the violence. Not all deaths involving guns are the same -- therefore trying to address each incident from the same point of view is futile. Until we learn more about Alexis -- the events leading up to the shootings and the motive -- the tragedy in Washington should not be used as catalyst for a conversation about gun control. Instead, we should mourn and wait for more information. Far too often assumptions surrounding the details of tragedies such as the one in Washington are made, and well-intentioned stances fall apart when additional facts come to light. The guns James Holmes was charged with using in Aurora were purchased legally. Beyond the presence of a gun, the crimes committed in the movie theater are not at all similar to what happens in the streets of our large cities. And each time a politician or gun-control advocate tries to use these two very different examples interchangeably, the entire conversation and argument are compromised. This happened after Newtown. It happened after Aurora. And it will keep continue to happen until the advocates accept that ridding the country of guns is a hopeless -- and unconstitutional mission -- and that the real goal should be addressing the factors that lead to the various forms of gun violence: factors such as poverty, mental health and failing schools. Last month the nation breathed a sigh of relief after Antoinette Tuff, a bookkeeper in an elementary school in suburban Atlanta, prevented a man with an AK-47-type weapon and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition from hurting anyone. It was not the time to talk generally about gun violence in this country. It was the time to discuss specifics such as cuts to mental health and its impact on services, given that the suspect, 20-year-old Michael Brandon Hill, has a long history of mental disorders. Hill's storyline is similar to that of Lanza, and there are questions whether Holmes, the admitted shooter in the Aurora movie theater, is insane. Public debates with Wayne LaPierre and attacks on the National Rifle Association have proven to be an ineffective way to prevent gun violence. In the wake of the Washington Navy Yard killings, perhaps a new strategy, one that doesn't involve playing on the nation's emotions or challenging the relevance of the Second Amendment, should be employed. That's not saying the NRA has won -- in fact, I think LaPierre should step down because each time he opens his mouth, he steps in it -- but at the end of the day the organization is more of an agitator than the enemy. There is no one enemy. Thus there is no one solution. Because like it or not, the folks spraying our cities with bullets are not NRA members or legal gun owners. And despite the tendency to tie it all together, they have nothing to do with the Adam Lanzas of the world. And it's too early to know how Alexis fits in the conversation. According to a count by USA Today, more than 900 people have been killed in mass shootings since 2006. The thousands of other victims of gun violence over the past seven years died from many different circumstances, requiring different conversations. This is why gun-control advocates need to abandon the routine of using mass shootings to turn law-abiding citizens into social pariahs and instead focus on something that could work.

meaning no party will win an outright majority of seats. But this time neither Conservatives nor Labour look like being able to build a coalition government without doing deals with more than one other political grouping. Britain is likely to experience an unstable era of Scandinavian-style politics where the chief preoccupation of the political class is not solving the problems of the nation, but putting together deals to enable any decisions to be taken at all. Reckless was the second former Tory to resign his seat and win his way back to Parliament in the purple colors of UKIP after Douglas Carswell had done the same in Clacton in October. And although his roughly 3,000 vote majority will be less sustainable at a General Election than Carswell's crushing victory, it keeps UKIP on track for its ambition of winning enough seats next May to hold the balance of power. In Rochester, UKIP managed to resist a huge Conservative campaign that included five visits from Prime Minister David Cameron, who was desperate to stave off another UKIP victory that could call his effectiveness as the leader of the Tories into question. UKIP also won over a significant proportion of the former working class Labour vote -- aided by a Labour front-bencher's online posting of a photo of a house in Rochester draped in English flags with a white van in the driveway. Politicians of all stripes were quick to pounce on Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry's ill-judged tweet as snobbish and derogatory, and Thornberry resigned her position before the night was over. UKIP also reduced the Liberal Democrat vote to a derisory figure: some of their former protest votes on the Left are now going to the Green Party. The UKIP bandwagon is still rolling. Reckless was a confused candidate who at one stage was slapped down by Nigel Farage for suggesting that EU immigrants might be sent home, but the party that secured a mere three percent at the last General Election in Britain has become a significant political player. It is now the obvious receptacle for protest votes in the way that the Liberal Democrats used to be. But their participation in a coalition government with the Conservatives has shredded the Lib-Dems' political appeal. UKIP has successfully harnessed to its bandwagon to the common feeling of disillusion with the two major parties and the Westminster "establishment." As well as its anti-European stance, it has profited from bringing immigration to the fore as a political issue. This has spooked lawmakers in other parties who have demanded that their own party leaders must also get tougher on immigration -- a policy area on which few deal in facts but on which much emotion is expended. But the more that Labour and the Tories rush out new immigration policies, the more the public say: "We thought you told us that UKIP were a bunch of fruitcakes, but now you are agreeing they were right all along." Political strategists used to believe that UKIP were chiefly a threat to the Conservatives, taking the votes of right-wing Euroskeptics away from them. But in the recent Heywood and Middleton by-election in the greater Manchester area UKIP came within a few hundred votes of grabbing a Labour seat too. With the resurgent Scottish National Party threatening to grab 30 of Labour's 40 Scottish seats in the Westminster Parliament, and Labour's leader Ed Miliband proving the lowest-rated occupant of his position in polling history, Labour too are shivering at the UKIP intervention. So where do we go from here? UKIP will revel in its triumph and redouble its efforts to entice more Euroskeptic Conservative MPs to jump ship in order to save their seats at the next election. David Cameron, his authority badly dented after he promised to throw the kitchen sink at saving the Rochester seat, will be under massive pressure from his MPs to turn the political tide now with the major speech he has for some time been promising on immigration (and which he postponed for fear of having the Rochester result taken as a verdict on his efforts). He is handicapped because the Conservatives' pledge to reduce immigration to less than 100,000 a year has failed because of the EU's commitment to the free movement of people within its borders, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is heading Europe's refusal to reconsider that principle. That again plays into UKIP's hands. Right-wing Euroskeptic Conservative MPs insist that their party and UKIP are part of the same political family, and they will now try to pressure Cameron into some sort of electoral pact -- arguing that otherwise Labour will "win" next May's election with less than a third of the votes. Cameron will resist, but the irony for UKIP is that of all the possible election results, the only one that will bring about their chief political aim -- an in/out vote on Britain's membership in the European Union -- is victory for the Conservatives who have promised that referendum.
A witness sources have described as Aaron Hernandez's "muscle man" says he was with the ex-New England Patriot the night of a 2012 Boston double homicide that police say may be linked to Hernandez, said a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. The witness, Alexander Bradley, has filed a civil lawsuit accusing Hernandez of shooting him in the face during an argument after they left a Florida strip club in February. Bradley lost sight in one eye because of the incident, according to the lawsuit. In what could be a crucial account for the prosecution, Bradley is telling investigators that he was at Boston's Cure nightclub -- with Hernandez -- on July 12, 2012, before Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, were fatally shot in their car, the law enforcement source said. Bradley and Hernandez were also captured on the nightclub's security camera, the source said. Bradley has testified before a grand jury in Boston after being arrested last week because he failed to show up for a court proceeding about a grand jury subpoena. A Boston grand jury has been hearing evidence allegedly linking Hernandez to the double homicide, sources have told CNN. Among the evidence is a .35 caliber handgun sources describe as the murder weapon in the double homicide. In addition, a silver SUV driven by Hernandez was discovered covered with dust in his uncle's garage, law enforcement sources say. Law enforcement sources say the SUV is believed to be linked to the deaths. Hernandez's lawyers have not commented about the investigation. The SUV was found as investigators searched the uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut, in connection with another shooting death, that of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez is charged with Lloyd's murder and has pleaded not guilty. He appeared in court Wednesday for a pretrial hearing in that case. Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd's June 17 execution-style shooting. Authorities have said that Hernandez, Wallace, and a third man, Carlos Ortiz, picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before his death. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people. Lloyd was not among them.
One of Africa's most successful footballers, Nwankwo Kanu, has had a glittering career on the pitch. The 6 ft 5 in Nigerian footballer has used his sizable stature in the game to help many others. Winning a gold medal with Nigeria in the 1996 Olympic Games he has also won the European Cup with Ajax; the English Premier League Title and FA Cup with Arsenal in 2002, and in 2008 scored the winning goal for Portsmouth in the FA Cup Final. But off the pitch, Kanu has worked just as hard to improve the lives of others. He set up the Kanu Heart Foundation in 2000 that raises money to help children with hearth defects. It's an issue that Kanu is particularly connected to. In 1995, when he was already a double-European Cup finalist, Kanu was told by a doctor for Inter Milan, the club he had just signed for, that he a faulty value in his heart. He was told he could never play football again. However he spent 14 months rehabilitating and then moved to Arsenal in England and arguably had the most successful years of his career. Now nearing the end of his career, Kanu has set up another foundation. Founded in 2008, The Kanu Football Foundation aims to help advise young African footballer who can face all sorts of pressures when trying to become a professional football and avoid being exploited.
Roughly half the schedulers at multiple Veterans Affairs hospitals said they received instructions from supervisors to falsify data and hide the true time it took patients to be seen by a doctor after making an appointment, new details from an internal VA audit show. Schedulers said supervisors directed them to manipulate information so their centers could meet performance goals, which would help top officials get bonuses, according to documents obtained by CNN. The new information also provided to Congress this week includes updates from specific VA hospitals that were not included in an internal audit released last month by the embattled agency. The ongoing saga involves multiple investigations into delayed care, potentially with deadly results, alarming management shortcomings and a culture that was said to have compromised the mission of providing prompt and effective medical care to millions of veterans, some of them returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. New VA secretary confirmed VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned over the scandal in May. His replacement, Robert McDonald, was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday unanimously. The former corporate CEO and ex-Army officer has pledged to swiftly introduce reforms. Under pressure from constituents back home and most members facing voters in November, Congress is poised to approve a $17 billion bipartisan proposal before the week is out. It would allow the agency to hire more medical staff, lease new facilities, and give veterans the opportunity to seek care outside the VA system. It would also allow the VA secretary to more easily fire top officials. Details of delayed care were first reported by CNN in an investigation of two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since, CNN reporting has expanded to include more hospitals and details of delayed care and allegations that up to 40 deaths were tied to the problem. Congress comes up with a deal on veterans Greater range of problems While the Phoenix VA medical center has received the most national scrutiny, the new information shows in greater depth a range of problems affecting numerous facilities nationwide. VA hospitals in Montgomery, Alabama, Clarksburg, West Virginia, and White City, Oregon, were among the worst cited in the new information. About 50% of schedulers at those facilities reported being told by their superiors to falsify data. Moreover, schedulers in Washington, Richmond, Gainesville, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere used "outside tracking logs" to hide long delays in care by not properly recording information in the scheduling system, the documents showed. Numerous other VA medical centers may have improperly used "paper wait lists" or excel spreadsheets to hide delays, according to the new internal audit details. Data from the audit released last month found that 13% of schedulers surveyed nationally said they were directed by hospital administrators to enter appointment dates that were different from those requested by a veteran. But the newly released data showed 55 of the VA medical centers audited had more than 13% of schedulers reporting such direction, the documents showed. Bad VA care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans, senator's report says Coaching schedulers Scheduling staff training has been controversial throughout recent investigations of VA management. The audit also showed that half of schedulers surveyed could not remember the date of their last training. The findings also showed there were attempts to coach and prepare staff and schedulers in a number of cases before they were questioned by auditors. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said any VA administrator who ordered employees to purposely manipulate patient wait times should be immediately fired. "The environment in today's Veterans Health Administration is one in which some VA executives are so driven in their quest for performance bonuses, promotions and power that they are willing to lie, cheat and put the health of the veterans they were hired to serve at risk," Miller said. Gingrich Opinion: We owe our veterans real change VA takes action The VA said in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it had proposed "a series of disciplinary" actions against six employees in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Fort Collins, Colorado, as a result of the audit. "Employees who have been found to have manipulated data, withheld accurate information from their supervisors, and affected the timeliness of care veterans receive do not reflect VA's values, and their actions will not be tolerated," said Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson. Carolyn Lerner, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, said, "We are encouraged by the VA's action in response to Office of Special Counsel's reports regarding whistleblower disclosures of manipulated wait-time data that masked scheduling problems at the VA's Cheyenne and Fort Collins facilities." The office is charged with representing whistleblowers across the country. Who is Bob McDonald? Veterans waiting longer for cancer care 'Corrosive culture,' weak leadership cripple VA, report says
and have found lots of new ways it can help you stay healthy and look and feel younger. Here's the latest on what C can really do for you. Prevent wrinkles You can't pick up a beauty product these days without the label touting its antioxidants. There's a good reason: Antioxidants -- like vitamin C -- help turn back the clock. An October 2007 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who ate foods rich in vitamin C had fewer wrinkles and less age-related dry skin than those whose diets contained only small amounts of the vitamin. C helps form collagen, which smooths fine lines and wrinkles, according to Patricia Farris, MD, clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Tulane University in New Orleans. The key seems to be C's ability to fight free radicals, a by-product of cell metabolism in your body. Free radicals are thought to attack proteins, fats, and DNA and break down collagen. C also seems to guard against ultraviolet rays from the sun, which can lead to freckles and a mottled complexion. "Vitamin C does some repair and firming on the skin," Farris says. Health.com: Can you guess her age? What to do now: Use a topical vitamin C treatment daily after you wash your face and before you slather on moisturizer or sunscreen so it penetrates the skin. Farris recommends La Roche-Posay Active C facial moisturizer or SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic topical antioxidant treatment. Protect your heart Experts continue to argue about whether antioxidants like vitamin C can prevent heart disease. But some of the evidence is highly persuasive. When Finnish researchers looked at studies involving nearly 300,000 people over 10 years, they found that taking more than 700 milligrams of C supplements daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 25 percent. And a recent study from Harvard University researchers hints that women who take a combo of 500 milligrams of vitamin C daily and 600 IU of vitamin E (another antioxidant) can cut their risk of stroke by 30 percent. It's possible that people who take vitamin supplements simply have healthier lifestyles than those who don't, which could explain this finding. It's also possible, experts say, that C enhances the functioning of endothelial cells (which line the inside of all blood vessels), slowing artery clogging and lowering blood pressure. What to do now: Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, which are full of vitamin C as well as other healthy nutrients, and consider taking C and E supplements. Experts say there are essentially no risks, but first check with your doctor. Health.com: Get your C's here Keep cancer at bay A diet full of vitamin C--rich fruits and vegetables isn't just good for your heart, it may also lower your risks of bladder, esophagus, stomach, and lung cancers. Even though more research is needed to find out which compounds in fruits and veggies do the trick, researchers say the association is strong. Someday, C may also be used to treat cancer. High levels of C given intravenously seem to be toxic to cancer cells (studies on vitamin C taken orally showed no effect on cancerous cells). Intravenous C appears to trigger the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which kills some cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed, says lead study author Mark Levine, MD, chief of the molecular and clinical nutrition section and senior staff physician at the National Institutes of Health. Levine says doctors at the University of Kansas Medical School and Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia are trying this therapy on cancer patients. What to do now: "Strive for five or more fruits and vegetables daily, in a rainbow of colors," Levine says. "It's where the most benefit is. Health.com: CAn C fight off a cold? Boost brain power Pairing vitamins C and E is smart for another reason: It may lessen your Alzheimer's risks by as much as 64 percent, according to research in the Archives of Neurology. Just 500 milligrams of C and 400 IU of E appear to be enough. The brain's high fat content makes it especially vulnerable to free radicals, but these antioxidants may act as shields, says study author Peter Zandi, PhD, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. "Some studies suggest that vitamin E does its job reducing free radicals in the body, but then its capacity is depleted," Zandi says. "Vitamin C may recharge E."  Health.com: The best multivitamin for you What to do now: Try taking C and E supplements, and talk to your doc about your risks for Alzheimer's and dementia. Save your eyesight Vitamin C can't prevent the need for reading glasses around age 45. But anti-oxidants, including C, help prevent one of the leading causes of blindness: age-related macular degeneration (AMD). More than 3.5 million Americans are thought to be in the early stages, and the disease strikes more women than men. A major clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute showed that a daily supplement of 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, 15 milligrams of beta-carotene, 80 milligrams of zinc, and 2 milligrams of copper reduced the risk of moderate or severe AMD-related vision loss by up to 25 percent. The antioxidants neutralize damage to the retina caused by, you guessed it, free radicals. What to do now: If you're at high risk for AMD (you're overweight or have a family history), check to see if your multi-vitamin contains the study's amounts of C, E, beta-carotene/vitamin A, zinc, and copper. Chances are, its C and E levels fall short, but additional supplements will do the job. (Caveat: Don't follow this advice if you smoke; this level of beta-carotene may up your lung-cancer risks.) Help you live longer You've probably heard that green tea boosts the body's defenses against toxins. That's important because toxins are thought to contribute to cancer, heart attack, stroke, and lots of other maladies. In fact, one to two cups a day may reduce a woman's risk of dying by about 20 per-cent, Japanese researchers say. What's the vitamin C connection? Citrus juices (lemon, lime, orange) may supercharge the immunity-boosting power of green tea. A new Purdue University study found that mixing citrus juice with green tea allowed 80 percent of the tea's anti-oxidants to stick around after simulated digestion, making the pairing healthier than thought, says study author Mario G. Ferruzzi, PhD, assistant professor in Purdue's department of food and nutrition. What to do now: Add at least an ounce of citrus juice to your green tea -- or try Tazo Lemon Green iced tea or SoBe Green Tea 3G. Both drinks are stocked with vitamin C.

The father of a New Year's Day baby pleaded guilty Thursday to killing the infant by violently shaking him. Camryn Jakeb Wilson was the first baby born in 2008 in Summit County, Ohio, arriving at 12:33 a.m. January 1. Craig Wilson's guilty plea in Akron, Ohio, to murder and child endangering charges ended a yearlong saga surrounding the death of Camryn Jakeb Wilson, the first baby born in Summit County, Ohio, in 2008. "This type of crime is always difficult to understand, but today I do hope that Camryn's mother has some closure and that today is one step toward healing," Summit County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said. Camryn's mother, Crystal Wilson, had left the 10-week-old infant in his father's care on March 12, 2008, while she attended a meeting. When she returned to their Cuyahoga Falls home she found Camryn in a baby swing, listless and breathing abnormally while her husband of 10 months sat on a couch. Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital quickly determined that Camryn had suffered traumatic brain injuries and bleeding in his eyes that could only have been caused by violent shaking.  Learn about shaken baby syndrome » Camryn died in his mother's arms, surrounded by other family members, on March 25, 2008, shortly after being removed from life support. Craig Wilson, 29, confessed to police that he was frustrated after an argument with his wife over his ex-girlfriend and a child he had with her. He shook and squeezed Camryn before laying him in the swing but hadn't intended to hurt the infant, he told police. The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome estimates that as many as 1,400 babies annually are injured or killed by shaking. Despite the confession, the case dragged on for a year after an autopsy showed Camryn had suffered broken ribs prior to the fatal shaking. The finding raised the possibility that another person had previously abused Camryn and perhaps contributed to his death, said Jonathan T. Sinn, Craig Wilson's defense attorney.  See photos of the family » Craig Wilson's trial was scheduled to begin Monday. Sinn had hoped to negotiate a plea deal with prosecutors that would send Craig Wilson to prison for a flat 20-year term, but in the end, prosecutors wouldn't budge. "From the moment my client was arrested, he took responsibility for his actions and for the killing of his child," Sinn said. "From a human perspective, that's very admirable. From a defense perspective, it makes it difficult to mount a defense when somebody acknowledges completely their guilt." Judge Lynne Callahan sentenced Wilson to 15 years to life. He is unlikely to be paroled in less than 20 years, Sinn said.
Bayer Leverkusen regained second place in the Bundesliga on Sunday, with a 4-2 win at home to struggling Stuttgart. Stuttgart twice battled back from behind, but goals in the last ten minutes of play from Stefan Reinartz and Stefan Kiessling ensured victory for coach Jupp Heynckes' side. The 2007 German champions Stuttgart now find themselves joint bottom-of-the-table with Monchengladbach, who inflicted a surprise 2-1 defeat at home to Champions League side Schalke. A goal from Peer Kluge gave mid-table Schalke a second-minute lead, but Gladbach leveled through Marco Reus before Mohamadou Idrissou scored to give his team their first home-win of the season. Just five points now separate the bottom five teams in the Bundesliga, with Stuttgart and Monchengladbach level at the foot of the table with just 19 points. Although up to second place Leverkusen still lie 10 points adrift of league leaders Borussia Dortmund -- who extended their lead with a home win over St. Pauli on Saturday -- but have a three point cushion over third-placed side Bayern Munich.
A family of six survived two days in wintry Nevada mountains by starting a fire and then bringing warm rocks into their overturned Jeep, preventing frostbite to the couple and four small children, local residents said Tuesday. When three residents finally found the family and their vehicle during a massive search, the family had little food left, so resident Salvador Paredes pulled a candy bar from his pocket and shared it with them, Paredes said. In a search involving 200 people, rescuers finally located the family on Tuesday after they had gone missing two days earlier during a playful outing in the snow in mountainous northwest Nevada. Temperatures on Monday morning, hours after the family disappeared, were about 21 degrees below zero, officials said. Winds were relatively light. The group was found safe in an area called Trinity Canyon, according to the Pershing County Sheriff's Office. They were discovered from a distance by a volunteer searcher using binoculars to scan mountainsides, the sheriff's office said. It wasn't immediately clear which of the three residents made the discovery. All six were in stable condition with "no frostbite, just some exposure issues," said Patty Bianchi, CEO of Pershing General Hospital. The family consists of a man and woman who have two children together; the woman also was traveling with her nephew and niece, the sheriff's office said. The adults "did a fabulous job keeping them warm," Bianchi said, referring to the children. Dr. Doug Vacek said all six were doing "very well," but he had no timetable for their release. "They just expressed that they're really happy and they're going to enjoy this Christmas" more than usual, he told reporters. Their Jeep softly rolled onto one side while on a dirt road, went down an embankment and landed in a crevice about 15 miles from Lovelock, said Sheila Reitz of the Pershing County Sheriff's Office. It was upside down when rescuers arrived. Chris Montes, another of the rescuers, told CNN on Tuesday night that "obviously they knew what to do. They kept those kids safe 48 hours in subzero temperatures." The group apparently ran out of food on Monday, he said. The children, ages 3 to 10, Montes said, "did not seem too bothered. They were in good spirits. They just figured they were camping." Joining Montes in finding the family was Paredes and his fiancee, who will marry this weekend. Survival expert Joseph Teti said the adults "made all the right decisions." It's the little decisions that add up to an enhanced chance for survival in brutal conditions, he said: Staying near the vehicle, telling people where you are traveling and refusing to panic. "Mother Nature will not allow you to make too many mistakes at all," said Teti, co-star of Discovery Channel's "Dual Survival." The discovery came about midday Tuesday as more than 200 people scoured a vast frozen range of Nevada spanning 6,000 square miles. Officials remained undaunted despite the fact they no longer received pings off the cell phone of the missing persons, Reitz said. On Monday, authorities had been encouraged when they were able to receive a couple of pings from the phone of James Glanton, 34, officials said. Cell service is spotty because the area is so remote. Also rescued were Glanton's girlfriend, Christina McIntee, 25, along with their two children -- Evan and Chloe -- and McIntee's niece and nephew. They all set out to play in the snow in the Seven Troughs mountain range Sunday. A massive search for them involved vehicles, planes and helicopters, Reitz said. The Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, said its cell phone forensics experts "played a critical role in helping rescuers narrow the search area," according to a statement by the patrol. "The cell phone forensics team pinpointed where they could not possibly be," Nevada Wing Commander Col. Tim Hahn said in a statement. The forensic efforts "were very time-consuming," he said. "This morning they provided a key clue that redirected the search and led to the rescue," Hahn said. One of the CAP crews spotted the family's silver 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee about the same time that the searcher with binoculars found the lost group, the patrol said. The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center will award the Nevada Wing with six saves, Hahn said. The children's ages are 10, 4, 4 and 3, the patrol said. Amanda Fitzpatrick, mother of 10-year-old Shelby Fitzpatrick, one of the missing children, joined the search in the bitter cold. "It's been extremely hard, probably the hardest 24 to 36 hours of my life," she earlier told CNN's Piers Morgan. "It's my baby girl." The family's disappearance was among the most dramatic developments in the Arctic-like weather shocking much of the Lower 48 states. Big flakes of wet snow and ice snarled travel across the country Tuesday and hit major airline hubs in the Northeast, with about 1,200 flight cancellations reported by Tuesday evening. Temperatures in storm-stricken parts of the country are expected to stay about 10 to 20 degrees below normal for the rest of the week, the National Weather Service said. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Holly Yan, Miguel Marquez, Carma Hassan, Sarah Aarthun, Chuck Conder, Shane Deitert, Stephanie Elam, Randi Kaye, Chuck Johnston, Judson Jones and Casey Wian contributed to this report.
Next year's college applicants have some difficult choices to make. Is it better to go to state school or private? Stay close to home or ship out to Abu Dhabi? Western students receiving their education in the UAE is not as far-fetched as it might sound as some of the world's most respected collegiate brands have set up outposts in the Gulf region. Dubai hosts 52 universities while Qatar has set up Education City, a sector that houses a number of U.S. colleges including Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Georgetown, and Northwestern. Next year, the first students admitted to New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi will graduate; a benchmark almost as significant as the scheduled completion of the university's new Saadiyat Island campus. "There are lots of exciting signs that the region is heating up and getting more dynamic in terms of higher education," says Phil Baty, the editor-at-large of Times Higher Education. "There's recognition (in the Gulf) that they need to prepare for the post-oil world, and they realize that a knowledge-based economy ensures growth in the future." Several local universities have stepped up their game, too, building state-of-the-art research facilities to attract students from abroad. Even Saudi Arabia is getting in on the act. This year witnessed the completion of Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University (PNU) in Riyadh -- a 2,000 acre site and the largest all-female university in the world. In several instances, investment in education in the region has paid off. One of the most prominent collegiate success stories is NYU Abu Dhabi, which started accepting students to its UAE hub four years ago. Read more: Seven-star satire in Dubai Despite initial fears from critics that the new campus could potentially water down both the brand and the quality of its degree, the Abu Dhabi facility is one of the most selective schools in the world, admitting 150 out of 9,000 applicants per class. Prospective students often have to decide between NYU Abu Dhabi and top tier universities like Oxford and Yale. In recent years, the school has been dubbed "the world's honors college". NYU president John Sexton -- the brainchild behind the project -- has lofty goals. "Our mandate is to create in NYU Abu Dhabi a school that educates the leaders of global civil society, from every sector of the world, and in every sector of society," he says. Though the Emirates outpost has, according to Sexton, "done a great deal to help NYU elevate its game," other universities in the area have met with more mixed results. A cheating scandal at the Dubai campus of Edinburgh's Heriot-Watts University earlier this year underscored the concerns that universities with operations overseas are not able to maintain their standards. Other institutions, such as the University of Waterloo in Dubai, had to close because of a lack of enrollment, while Michigan State University curtailed it undergraduate program and now only offers six Masters degrees. "There have been some examples of market failure, of universities embarrassing themselves and getting it wrong, rather than planting their flag abroad," says Baty. "The issue is, how much are they invested? Are they just about pushing the global brand abroad, or are they genuinely on the ground, creating an infrastructure that will last?" Even with the success stories, the moral implications of doing business in states with limited freedom of speech and mixed human rights records has left some critics feeling uncomfortable. Infographic: Press freedom in the Middle East Earlier this year, LSE pulled out of a conference in the UAE (and subsequently witnessed one of its scholars barred entry) after the authorities restricted the inclusion of sensitive topics. Back in Manhattan, some of NYU's faculty members have also expressed concern about the UAE's stance towards gays (illegal) and Israelis (unrecognized). Sexton, however, is unperturbed. "My experience of the Emirates is that it's a very open society. Now, it's not Greenwich Village but as you move through the world you have to adapt to local customs. My daughter doesn't dress the same way in Istanbul as she does in New York; when I'm in the UK, I'm not as free to criticize public officials as I am in the U.S. You just have to be aware of rules and regulations," he says. Leah Reynolds, a senior at NYU Abu Dhabi, agrees with Sexton. Her experience, she notes, is about getting exposure to a wide cross section of cultures, not about imposing her own. "In my classes, every country we refer to has a case study right there; chances are, someone in the classroom that will have had that experience, no matter what it is," she says.
After shooting several people at the home of his former in-laws, police say Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, still dressed as Santa Claus, sprayed gasoline throughout the home intending to set it on fire. Police carry the homemade device they believe Bruce Jeffrey Pardo used to set the home on fire. But his plan went awry. The home exploded, windows were blown out, and part of Pardo's Santa suit melted onto his skin. He suffered third-degree burns. That's why police say he decided to kill himself rather than use the airline ticket to Canada that was in his pocket. Pardo killed nine people, police said. Three others were injured, including an 8-year-old. A 16-year-old girl was wounded by gunfire and was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. A woman who jumped out a second-floor window broke her leg and was hospitalized. None of the victims has been identified. Police said Pardo showed up at the home dressed as Santa and had $17,000 cling-wrapped to his legs and inside a girdle.  Watch police talk about what was found on the gunman's body » He knocked on the door. And when the 8-year-old ran to greet him, he shot her in the face.  Watch police describe the girl's injuries » Terrified people inside the home called 911. "Stay away from the window!" a woman can be heard pleading, "Please come immediately ... he's shooting! He's shooting!"  See photos from the scene » Some fled the house any way they could. Others sought shelter inside, some ducking under the dining room table, one witness said. Pardo was targeting his ex-wife's family, police said, shooting some of them "execution-style." Afterward, he prepared to set the home on fire using a homemade device designed to spread fuel.  Watch investigators at the burned-out home » After the home exploded, Pardo removed his Santa suit, put on street clothes and began to knock out lights in the area as he fled the scene, according to a witness on a recording of a 911 call. Pardo fled to his brother's home in nearby Sylmar, California, police said. When Pardo realized his brother wasn't home, he broke in and eventually shot himself to death, police said. Police later found his rental car with the remnants of the Santa suit on the seat. It was rigged to explode if the costume was removed. During a search of Pardo's home in Montrose, California, police found five empty boxes for semiautomatic handguns, two high-powered shotguns and a container of "racing fuel." Police said they recovered four handguns at various locations.  Watch how the massacre unfolded » Investigators have yet to identify the charred remains recovered from the burned house. Ed Winter, assistant chief Los Angeles County coroner, said the intense fire caused the top floor of the two-story house to collapse. Winter said the bodies were "severely burned and charred," and dental and medical records and X-rays will be used to establish identities. Police said they have not accounted for Pardo's ex-mother-in-law, ex-father-in-law and ex-wife. Police suggested marital problems as a motive for the attack and said Pardo and his wife of one year settled a contentious divorce last week. Covina Police Chief Kim Raney said Pardo's former in-laws regularly have a party Christmas Eve and that one neighbor always arrives dressed as Santa. This year that neighbor was away, police said.
Humorist Dave Barry is back with a new book. The prolific writer shares parenting stories in "You Can Date Boys When You're Forty: Dave Barry on Parenting and Other Topics He Knows Very Little About." He has written more than 30 books, but this is the first that headlines his role as a parent. Despite the title, Barry explains, it's not purely a parenting book. "I wouldn't want anybody to think that this is a book where they're going to learn useful information about parenting," he said. "Or, really, anything else." Like many of his books, this is a collection of essays sharing his opinions on a wide range of issues and experiences. Readers will learn about his impressions of "Fifty Shades of Grey," his tips on how to cook a steak and his hatred of his mail. The 66-year-old also shares personal stories about his kids, Rob, 33, and Sophie, 14. He reveals that he "made the ultimate sacrifice" for his daughter: He took her to a Justin Bieber concert. Barry received a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his nationally syndicated humor column. For nearly 30 years, he has lived in Miami, which has provided plenty of fodder for his fiction and nonfiction books. "If you want to write humor, just come here," he said. "You don't really need a sense of humor at all. You just write down what people actually do here, and it strikes everyone else as outrageously funny." Barry spoke to CNN about his new book, his daughter's changing musical tastes and his plans for his next project. Below is an edited transcript. CNN: What parenting advice would you offer? Dave Barry: I'd say lighten up. I think a lot of parents get pretty intense. As far I can tell, more it's the moms than the dads, partly because the dads, let's face it, are irresponsible scum and don't even necessarily know how old their children are or what their names are. It's the moms who are doing everything. But they sometimes get a little hovery. A little intense. And a little too determined to actually control the outcome of their child's lives, which you really can't do. But there seem to be parents who believe they can. CNN: Have you modified your parenting style having a daughter versus a son? Barry: Absolutely. Girls turn into women, and they do it really fast and dramatically and terrifyingly. Suddenly -- boom! -- they are women. And then, boys come around. I didn't worry about sex or social life or anything like that. With Sophie, I'm really aware of boys, because I happen to be one, or I was one. I'm a male, and I know we're scum. We're all scum. We know it. When they show up, they're nice to me, because I'm the dad. But they're not fooling me. I know they're scum, deep inside. I want them to go away. It would be nice if I could get a humane trap, a boy trap, that I would put on the lawn. It would be baited with something that boys like, like fireworks, something insane. When I hear it clang shut, I would go out and take the boy and release him humanely in the Everglades. CNN: How does Sophie feel? Is she OK with waiting until she's 40 to date? Barry: No. She would completely disregard anything I would tell her about boys. She is so entrenched. She is in this world. They are so connected, these kids. She is close, personal best friends with basically every young teenage girl in North America. They are all connected on Twitter or Instagram or whatever it is they're on now. She is constantly communicating with at least 17,000 people at once. She is part of this matrix of girls. So she has no interest at all in what I have to say. She doesn't have time, really, to communicate with me, other than, "Would you prefer waffles this morning or Fruity Pebbles?" That's my main communication. I make her breakfast. Her interest in my opinion about boys is, I would say, close to zero. CNN: Aside from the Bieber concert, what other sacrifices have you made as a parent? Dave Barry: The bad news is, (Sophie) is on a travel soccer team. Instead of watching her dance, now I watch her play soccer. I like it, but it's the travel part that I don't get. We'll drive 400 miles to watch our team lose. I'm thinking, why couldn't we just stay home and play somebody that can beat us? Why do we have to go to all that effort to lose? I like being a parent, but there are sacrifices. CNN: Do you have any advice for Justin Bieber, who has been in the news lately for the wrong reasons? Barry: He should listen to somebody beside whoever he's listening to now. I don't think he's getting a ton of guidance. My main advice is to him is, "Just stay away from my daughter, Justin Bieber. She doesn't like you any more anyway." She likes One Direction. I think. As of this morning, anyway. CNN: What is your next project? Barry: I wrote a book called "The Worst Class Trip Ever." It's about an eighth-grade class trip that goes really wrong. I was a chaperone on a class trip with my daughter. Nothing went particularly wrong; it's just, I thought, "Man. This would be a good opportunity for a book. Things could go really wrong." You have a bunch of kids and a bunch of parents who are basically rank amateurs, wrangling children in a strange place. Things could go really wrong. That was my idea. It's a class from Miami, based on my daughter's middle school really, that goes on a class trip to Washington. Five kids get involved in a seriously bad situation. High jinks ensue. Dave Barry's latest book of essays, "You Can Date Boys When You're Forty: Dave Barry on Parenting and Other Topics He Knows Very Little About," published March 4.
Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked police in eastern Afghanistan Tuesday morning, leaving five officers dead, police said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack that occurred in the city of Jalalabad. Six or seven civilians were also injured in the violence and five of the attackers died, according to Mohammad Sharif Amin, a local police spokesman. This attack comes a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Afghanistan for a trip to help repair strained relations with President Hamid Karzai. Kerry landed in Kabul on Monday afternoon and met with Karzai at the presidential palace. The attack, early Tuesday morning, happened some 145 kilometers (90 miles away) from Kabul. At least eight attackers stormed a police station in Jalalabad, authorities said, igniting two car bombs and firing at officers. The Taliban, which is known to inflate numbers of the dead in past attacks, said as many as 40 officers and 15 foreign trainers were killed. That tally was not verified by Afghan police.
Police in India have charged 63 people with murder in the beating death of a company boss who fired them. Labor minister Oscar Fernandes was criticized for saying Chaudhary's death was warning to management. The 63 were among 137 people police had rounded up by Wednesday -- two days after a mob of fired employees attacked L.K. Chaudhary, the chief executive of an Italian car parts manufacturing company. The others were charged with disturbing the peace in the Monday incident in Noida, located in the outskirts of the capital New Delhi. More arrests are likely, said R. K. Chaturvedi, the senior superintendent of police in Noida. The former employees of Graziano Transmissioni had gone to meet with company management over their reinstatement, said Noida police Inspector Manoj Pathak. The meeting turned violent, and the mob attacked Chaudhary with iron rods, Pathak said. On Tuesday, India's labor minister, Oscar Fernandes, drew sharp criticism after he said Chaudhary's death should serve as a warning to management, according to CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN. "The workers should be dealt (with) with compassion and should not be pushed so hard that they resort to whatever that had happened in Nodia" CNN-IBN quoted Fernandes as telling reporters. The minister later apologized, telling CNN his comments had been taken out of context. He said the murder of the boss could never be justified. The Italian Embassy said the company had, for several months, been facing "violent forms of protest by self-proclaimed workers' representatives." "The situation had been repeatedly brought to the attention of the competent Indian authorities, both at central and local level," it said in a statement. Business groups condemned the killing with the Confederation of Indian Industry calling it "tragic, unwanted and gory." "Such instances of industrial violence cannot be a solution to any problem and must not be tolerated," said Salil Singh, chairman of the group that promotes industrial growth. Meanwhile, authorities sought to appease businesses that police were aggressively investigating the case. "The legal course will be followed and all culprits brought to book," Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said. "This stray tragic occurrence would not be allowed to mar India's position as an investment-friendly destination." CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.
Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet have been evacuated as the bay turned black from an oil spill over the weekend. Authorities estimated that around 5,000 liters of crude oil have washed up on the island, having leaked into the ocean from an offshore pipeline belonging to PTT Global Chemical, Thailand's largest petrochemical producer. The total leakage is estimated at 50,000 liters. Due to its beautiful beaches and proximity to Bangkok -- the travel time from the capital is a little less than four hours by bus and then boat -- the island has long been a popular Thai weekend destination. Tourist activities on the island are largely ocean-oriented and include jet-skiing, snorkeling and banana-boating. Gallery: Oil spill on Koh Samet Effect on tourism It's still unclear to what extent the spill will affect local tourism, but the damage was initially reportedly limited to one beach, at Ao Phrao. There are 14 beaches on the island. "We've had some hotel cancellations on Samet," Rayong province tourism authority director Chuchart Oncharoen told the Bangkok Post. "Whether this has a long-term impact on the island depends on how quickly PTT cleans up the mess." The affected beach is on the less populated Western part of the island, where resorts have closed and tourists have been evacuated to hotels in other areas. The island is currently in its tourism low season -- the high season is from October to April. "By far the majority of tourists who go to Koh Samet stay at resorts and hotels on the eastern side of the island," Thailand travel blogger Richard Barrow told CNN. Gallery: Oil spill on Koh Samet Spill 'worse than thought' However, an opposition MP has suggested the damage from the spill may be worse than first thought, reports Australia's ABC. "If that (50,000 litres) was the real amount, they should have already eliminated it -- they should have solved the problem fast enough before it reached Samet island," said Sathit Pitutacha, from Thailand's Democrat Party. The environmental group Greenpeace also called the spill "massive," according to the ABC, and called upon the Thai government to end oil exploration in the Gulf of Thailand. Some travelers to Phrao Bay have already posted about the unexpected change in their itineraries. "The oil completely covered the beach when we woke up in the morning," wrote Tripadvisor reviewer MatJens about his curtailed stay at Lima Coco resort, one of the popular hotels in the area that has been closed. "We rebooked to a hotel on Ko Chang and the personnel at Lima Coco were very helpful getting us there. We also got a voucher covering the days we paid in advance," wrote MatJens on Monday. A statement from PTT Global Chemical said the company had deployed booms to contain the oil as well as oil spill dispersant. It added that the Thai navy and approximately 300 workers from PTT Global Chemical are continuing to clean up the area.
Two Italians have been kidnapped by Maoist insurgents in eastern India, the local authorities said Monday, in what is believed to be the first abduction of Westerners in the region. Italian nationals Bosusco Paolo and Claudio Colangelo have been held hostage by left-wing rebels in the eastern state of Orissa since Wednesday, said Rajesh Prabhakar Patil, the top administrator of the state's Kandhamal district. "As of now, the government has expressed its willingness to negotiate" to secure the Italians' release, Patil said, noting that the kidnappings came to light Sunday. Anti-Maoist operations, part of a decades-long conflict, have been suspended in the troubled Kandhamal area, and the authorities are in the process of appointing a mediator for talks, he said. It was not immediately clear what the kidnappers were demanding in return for the release of the Italian tourists. Patil said unconfirmed reports from some local journalists had suggested that the fighters wanted government troops to pull out from the region and for charges against their fellow rebels to be withdrawn. "Demands will be clear and confirmed once talks begin," he said. Meanwhile, the Indian external affairs ministry has briefed the Italian government about the matter, ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said in a post on Twitter. The Maoist rebels have been battling the Indian government in several eastern states in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s. They say they are fighting for the poor and the dispossessed. The authorities have said they suspect the Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities, but also among youth and intellectuals. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people the Maoists call "class enemies," the insurgents also are believed to have carried out attacks on infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.
The Rev. Billy Graham, the 88-year-old legendary Christian evangelist, was hospitalized in North Carolina early Saturday for evaluation and treatment of intestinal bleeding. Evangelist Billy Graham speaks at the Billy Graham Library dedication on May 31, 2007, in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was admitted to the Mission Health and Hospitals in Asheville, North Carolina, near his home in Montreat, and is listed in fair condition, a hospital spokesman said in a written statement. "Mr. Graham's physicians said the illness does not appear to be life-threatening, as Mr. Graham's condition had stabilized over the hours following admission and treatment. "An upper endoscopy and a bleeding scan showed no areas of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The physicians say the bleeding may have come from diverticuli, small pouches that can form in the lower intestine. These may become irritated and bleed. A diverticular bleed often begins suddenly and may stop on its own." Graham's wife, Ruth Bell Graham, died in June. E-mail to a friend
A post-9/11 law that sets federal standards for state driver's licenses and identification cards is under fire from the head of the agency enforcing that law, the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano, here last week in San Pedro, California, wants to replace the Real ID. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano this week said she is working with governors to repeal the Real ID Act, which was passed in 2005 and went into effect last year. The bill is popular in Washington, but is scorned by many governors who bear the responsibility and cost of validating that holders of driver's licenses are citizens or legal residents of the United States. Napolitano, former governor of Arizona, said she has met with governors of both parties recently "to look at a way to repeal Real ID." She said she wants to substitute the federal law with "something else that pivots off of the driver's license but accomplishes some of the same goals. And we hope to be able to announce something on that fairly soon." Napolitano made her remarks Tuesday in response to a question at a conference of the Anti-Defamation League. On Wednesday, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, a sponsor of the law, said he was "angered" by Napolitano's comments. "Real ID is a necessary program for keeping America safe. It is the will of Congress and also a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission," Sensenbrenner said. "When the Democrats took over the majority in the 110th Congress, they said they wanted to implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. I am highly disappointed that they are going back on their word by repealing this important recommendation, and substituting it with a weaker, less safe program that provides terrorists with too many avenues to attack." While Napolitano is looking for ways to repeal Real ID, her department's Web site continues to espouse the law's merits. "Raising the standards of state-issued identification is an important step toward enhancing national security," the Web site says. "Because a driver's license serves so many purposes [access to federal buildings, nuclear power plants, boarding aircraft, etc.], terrorists actively seek fraudulent state-issued identification. The Real ID rules will make it more difficult for them, while making it easier for law enforcement to detect falsified documents," it says. The law, which requires all states to enforce specific identification requirements for driver's licenses and identification cards, went into effect last year, but the federal government has given states until the end of this year to implement it. States can get extensions until May 2011 for implementation if they meet certain benchmarks.
A 16-year-old girl pleads with her parents not to barter her into a marriage. Komol, from India, dreamed of continuing her education, going to college and providing a better life for her parents. But what she wanted counted little. She became pregnant with her first child at age 16, in a marriage she did not want. "Since then, I have hardly ever been allowed to step out of the house," Komol was reported as saying, in a United Nations Population Fund report released Wednesday. "Sometimes, when the others are not at home, I read my old school books, and hold my baby and cry." "She is such an adorable little girl, but I am blamed for not having a son." One in every five girls (about 19%) gives birth before she turns 18 in developing countries, according to the report. Of the 7.3 million girls who give birth every year, 2 million of them are under the age of 14. The report states that pregnancies -- especially for these girls -- "are not the result of a deliberate choice" but rather "the result of an absence of choices and of circumstances beyond a girl's control," affecting their health, education and future job opportunities. "For these very young adolescents who do not have a say in whether or when they will become pregnant, their futures are destroyed, and their basic human rights are violated," said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund in an e-mail. Countries with the highest percentage of reported births before age 18 were mostly in West Africa, in countries such as Niger (51%), Chad (48%), Mali (46%) and Guinea (44%). Globally, adolescent births are declining. But they are increasing in three regions -- South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. How it relates to child marriages Underlying factors for early pregnancies include poverty, sexual violence, lack of access to reproductive health and education, and child marriages. In some countries, girls are used as bargaining chips to strengthen alliances, pay family debts, leading to child marriages. Families "may want to divest themselves of the burden of having a girl," said the report. "In extreme cases, they may want to earn money by selling the girl." This could stem from poverty, pressures from their communities, partners and even their own families. Police: Mom sold daughters' virginity Despite near-universal commitments to end child marriages, one in three girls in developing countries is married before age 18, according to the report. In Bangladesh, Chad and Niger, more than one in three girls is married before she turns 15. Niger has the highest child marriage rate and adolescent birth rate, according to the annual report. Why young pregnancies are so dangerous Every year, 70,000 girls die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to UNICEF. They may lack proper nutrition or health care. And girls who are pregnant at age 15 or younger are also at higher risk for eclampsia (seizures), anemia, postpartum hemorrhage and puerperal endometritis (uterine infection). Girls who are not fully physically developed are at risk for prolonged labor, which could result in obstetric fistula. This condition, marked by a hole in the birth canal, usually results in the death of the baby and makes the mother incontinent. It's not just developing countries... While the vast majority of teenage pregnancies happen in the developing world, the developed world is not immune to such issues. About 5% of teenage births (680,000 out of 13.1 million) occur in developed countries. The United States leads the developed world in teenage births. But teen pregnancy rates there are declining; in 2011, the number of babies born to women aged 15 to 19 was at a record low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rural America has a teen pregnancy problem Even in countries with low teenage births, ethnic minorities and marginalized groups grapple with socio-economic issues leading to early pregnancies. In Serbia, the teenage birth rate among the Roma minority is more than six times the national average. In Bulgaria, half of Roma girls give birth before turning 18, highlighting the problems of exclusion, child marriage and lack of reproductive health care. What needs to change? Pregnancy prevention campaigns are aimed at changing girls' behaviors, implicitly blaming the girl for pregnancies at a young age, according to the report. "Such approaches and thinking are misguided because they fail to account for the circumstances and societal pressures that conspire against adolescent girls and make motherhood a likely outcome of their transition from childhood to adulthood," wrote Osotimehin. The report makes recommendations to "build girls' human capital" and offer "opportunities so that motherhood is not seen as their only destiny." It cited a study that found when Kenyan schools began providing children with uniforms free of charge, the dropout rate decreased by 18% and pregnancy rates fell 17%, showing that access to education was an effective tool. In Guatemala, Mayans are the country's most disadvantaged group, with problems of child marriage. A support network for rural Mayan girls provided safe space and taught leadership skills. Results showed girls in the program stayed in school and had much lower pregnancy rates than the national average.
Arriving at the London premiere of his self-titled mockumentary dressed in an enormous bearskin hat, cropped red army tunic and barely there hot pants, flamboyant Austrian fashionista, "Bruno," paid sartorial tribute to the British as only he knows how. Bear-ing all: British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen's latest comic creation Austrian fashionista, Bruno, hits the red carpet. Waxed to perfection and flanked by a group of muscular black men dressed like a camp Queen's Guards, the gay fashion reporter flounced down the carpet to greet his public. "Vassup CNN! Lookin' hot," Bruno said to CNN. "I don't want any attention; I'm not here to promote my movie." "Bruno," which hits cinemas in most territories next month, is the latest comic creation of British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who last shocked, insulted and delighted audiences in 2006 with Borat, Kazakhstan's "Most Famous Broadcaster." Bruno continues the unique approach to comedy Baron Cohen honed with characters like uneducated, loutish jungle music fan Ali G and then homophobic, anti-Semitic Kazakh journalist Borat.  Watch "Bruno" on the red carpet » His specialty is characters who say the unsayable: like Bruno's carpet quip that his new film is "the most important movie starring a gay Austrian since 'Terminator 2,'" in joking reference to the married (and firmly heterosexual) Austrian Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, now Governor of California.  In pictures: Bruno offers fashion advice to CNN » Baron Cohen puts his creations in real-life situations and uses them to draw unsuspecting participants into letting well-hidden prejudices slip out, engage in embarrassing behavior or contradict themselves. Characters like Bruno and Borat "essentially work as a tool," Baron Cohen told UK paper The Observer in a rare out-of-character interview: "By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice." Baron Cohen's approach courts controversy. "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" opened to a wave of outrage from race-relations campaigners. This time it is gay-rights campaigners who are up in arms. "Sacha Baron Cohen's well-meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others," Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation told the New York Times. While some critics may suggest that his films may reinforce prejudices, others disagree. "It is difficult to accuse Cohen of making films that are racist or homophobic," Aubrey Day, Editor-in-Chief of Total Film magazine told CNN. "He takes characters and exaggerates them for broad comic value, but I don't think there's any credence in the idea that he supports any of those ideals." But Baron Cohen certainly knows how to manipulate the media. The 37-year-old has been whipping up anticipation for "Bruno" with a series of attention-grabbing, hilarious stunts. In September last year, he brought chaos to the hallowed fashion shows of Milan when he stormed the catwalk of designer Agata Luiz de la Prada's show dressed in a Velcro suit with clothes from backstage stuck all over it. Most recently, he descended from the ceiling at the MTV Movie Awards wearing nothing but a pair of angel's wings and a skimpy thong before "falling" onto irate rapper Eminem's face. Eminem stormed out of the awards but later admitted he knew about the stunt beforehand. "Borat" debuted at number one in the U.S. box office and went on to gross $300 million in box office and DVD sales. Industry experts are predicting an even bigger return for "Bruno." The secret of the Baron Cohen comedy phenomenon may lie in his combination of laughs with something a bit deeper: namely his ability to highlight prejudices and hypocrisies. "What he does very well is hold a mirror up to a lot of society's current ideals and expose them for what they are," Day told CNN. "That is one of the joys of his films. "You can enjoy them on a simple level, in that they are very funny, but hopefully you also come away thinking, or maybe re-thinking some of your attitudes."
Power outages in Connecticut, rail service disruptions in Washington and warnings to conserve electricity in New York City mark the second day of the Northeast heat wave. As many as 9,000 customers of Connecticut Light and Power in Stamford were without electrical service Tuesday, according to the power company's website. A heat-related transformer failure at a substation in Stamford caused the outage, according to a spokeswoman for the utility company. Temperatures reached 100 Tuesday in Stamford, according to the National Weather Service. In Washington, at least one rail line was delayed when Metrorail officials found a "heat kink" on the Red Line. A kink occurs in extremely hot weather when overheated tracks expand but can't be constrained by cross ties or ballast, and when a kink is found, train speed is reduced to ensure passenger safety, Metro said. Track inspectors will continue to monitor all conditions should other tracks become affected. New York  residents -- advised by Con Ed Power to conserve electricity during the heat wave -- did just that, company spokeswoman Joy Faber said. "No usage records  were broken in the city or  the state," she said Tuesday. Earlier in the day at  a media briefing with reporters, a Con Ed official had feared that  Tuesday's usage rate would surpass  the record of 13,141 megawatts set in August of  2006. Faber said later that usage peaked Tuesday -- as New York temperatures hit 103 degrees in some places, according to the National Weather Service -- at 12, 963 megawatts. Even without a record-setting day, residents were still being encouraged to cut back  on electricity consumption, officials said. "Postpone using  large appliances, turn out lights, use fans instead of air conditioners, or  if you have to use an air  conditioner, set it at 78 (degrees)," said Con Ed spokesman John Miksad. "This is a team effort," he said. "We will get through this." As many as 400 cooling stations have opened in New York's five boroughs, according to the Office of Emergency Management. OEM Commissioner Joe Bruno urged people to utilize the center, and advised neighbors to check on neighbors to make sure they are well. "This is a significant health emergency as well as a heat emergency," Bruno said. The heat wave has claimed one life. A 92-year-old woman was found dead in her home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to the medical examiner's office. The woman, who was found by a neighbor, had opened a few windows in her home but did not have air conditioning, said a medical examiner's spokesman. Heat advisories remain in effect through Wednesday evening for much of the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service, which also issued an additional "excessive heat warning" to be in effect until 8 p.m. Wednesday for Philadelphia; Trenton, New Jersey; and parts of Delaware. Weather service officials are advising people to stay indoors as the prolonged heat and humidity creates a "dangerous situation." "Be sure to check on your elderly relatives and neighbors. Coaches, trainers, camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke," the weather service warned.
Contrary to the Hollywood image in movies like "Minority Report," technology hasn't served law enforcement particularly well over the years. Fragmented and complex operating systems have challenged police officers to manually enter information into multiple programs. And yet officers still struggle to retrieve the information they need -- especially in the field, where it can be a matter of life or death. A large number of law enforcement agencies are still hindered by antiquated technologies. But agencies that have upgraded their operating and investigative systems have been tremendously effective in ensuring the safety of their citizens. Police forces like the Guardia Civil in Spain and An Garda Siochana in Ireland were early technology adopters and now benefit from some of the most efficient police operations and investigative systems in the world. These are the police forces of the future -- the ones that others will be modeling themselves after in the years to come. Accenture recently studied police forces from around the world and found that in every region, police are hungry for new technology. They see tech such as analytics, biometrics (identification of humans by their characteristics or traits) and facial recognition as keys to effectively fighting crime and maximizing the time officers spend in the field. Despite the reality of reduced budgets, law enforcement agencies that adopt new technologies can prevent crimes more effectively and solve crimes faster. ACLU raises privacy concerns about police technology tracking drivers Video analytics What many people don't know is that there's a solid infrastructure of closed-circuit TV in most cities. Historically, these CCTV cameras -- both publicly and privately owned -- have been used retrospectively to examine crime scenes for evidence. Images from street cameras along the Boston Marathon route helped identify the two bombing suspects there last April. In California, the San Diego Trolley Corporation now safeguards light-rail passengers with a video-analytics system that can alert security guards when it spots suspicious behaviors, such as an unmarked vehicle in a pedestrian zone. Cities such as London and Singapore also are testing pilot programs to apply predictive analytics to video feeds. Singapore's government and economic leaders recently launched a one-year "Safe City" pilot program to bring automated analytics to existing CCTV infrastructure across the city. The program will apply predictive analytics to video feeds to detect which of a multitude of street incidents, such as crowd and traffic movements, pose real concerns for public safety. These video feeds also will identify environmental threats to public safety, such as fire or flooding, as they arise. When a serious incident is identified, an alert will be sent to the authorities. This program enables real-time information sharing and will give law enforcement deeper insight into public safety across Singapore's densely populated urban landscape. It also will increase police ability to anticipate and respond to incidents as they occur. Police embracing tech that predicts crimes Data mining and predictive analytics Other cities are using statistical analysis and predictive modeling to identify crime trends and highlight "hidden" connections between disparate events. This helps police gain a more complete picture of crime, predict patterns of future criminal behavior and identify the key causal factors of crime in their area. Police in Richmond, Virginia, adopted an advanced data-mining and predictive-analytics program in 2006 in an ambitious campaign to reduce crime. In the first year of use, the city's homicide rate dropped 32%, rapes declined 19%, robberies fell 3% and aggravated assaults dropped by 17%. Police in Memphis, Tennessee, also applied predictive analytics -- which relies on data-analysis software to predict where crimes will likely take place -- and saw immediate results. Serious crime in that city fell 30% between 2006 and 2010. Such technology also has been hailed for helping to lower crime rates in Los Angeles since its introduction by the LAPD in 2011. And Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, uses an analytics model that brings together location-based crime and traffic-crash data to develop effective methods for deploying law enforcement and other resources. Using geo-mapping to identify "hot spots" -- areas with high rates of crimes and car accidents -- the parish saw the number of fatal drunk-driving crashes fall from 27 in 2008 to 11 in 2009, with a corresponding increase in drunk-driving arrests. Biometrics and beyond Next on the horizon of law-enforcement technologies is biometrics, including facial recognition. The same software that has been used to identify high rollers and cheats in casinos, for example, can now be used to single out people banned from football stadiums or terrorists on a watch list at key border-control points. Similar biometrics, including iris recognition, are now used to match passengers to their digital images on e-passports at border crossings all over the world, something that was unthinkable a decade ago. While not all police investigations resemble "CSI" today, the potential for technology to reduce crime is real and proven. Although reduced budgets are making it harder for some police forces to adopt new tech tools, all law enforcement agencies must prepare their officers to embrace new technologies as they become available. Our future safety depends on it. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ger Daly.

One of the women who tried to assassinate President Ford 32 years ago was released on parole Monday from a federal prison in California, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesman. Sara Jane Moore, 77, was released in the morning from the federal women's prison in Dublin, outside San Francisco, according to Mike Truman of the Bureau of Prisons. There was no immediate comment from the prison facility, where Moore had been Inmate No. 04851180. Officials said she had a recent parole hearing, but they did not know what prompted her release. Nor was it clear what her plans are or where she is headed. The former nurse and mother of five had been trying for 20 years to gain her freedom. Moore was arrested in September 22, 1975, outside the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco after firing a single shot at  Ford. A bystander had grabbed Moore's arms just before she fired a .38 caliber revolver and was credited with probably saving the president's life. The bullet missed Ford's head by inches. Seventeen days earlier Ford survived another attempt on his life by Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, in Sacramento, California. Moore pleaded guilty to attempted assassination and was sentenced to life in prison. At the time she had been married and divorced seven times. In recent interviews Moore said she regretted her actions, which she said were motivated by radical revolutionary politics. As an inmate she worked as an accountant in the prison drapery factory. Ford died December 26, 2006, from natural causes. E-mail to a friend
Iraq's Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who fled the country months ago, was sentenced to death Sunday, an official said. The verdict came on a day when a wave of violence across Iraq left at least 79 people dead and 270 wounded. Together, the death sentence and the violence raise questions about the stability of the country just nine months after U.S. troops were withdrawn. Al-Hashimi was sentenced to hang "because he was involved directly in killing a female lawyer and a general with the Iraqi army," said Abdul Sattar al-Berqdar, a spokesman for Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council. "There are many other charges against al-Hashimi, but this is one of the charges he was convicted of," al-Berqdar said. Al-Hashimi denies the charges, which include the accusation that he ran death squads. He called the accusations part of a "black comedy" in February. Attacks on Iraqi police, army kill dozens "Everybody knows that my case is a political case, from beginning to end, and that the charges against me are fabricated and far from the truth," al-Hashimi said in May. The death sentence raises the stakes in the controversy around Iraq's top Sunni Muslim politician, who accuses the country's Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of pushing the country towards a religious divide. The arrest warrant for al-Hashimi was issued soon after his Iraqiya party announced it would boycott Parliament, saying al-Maliki was cutting it out of the decision-making process. His Sunni-majority party has since ended its boycott, though al-Hashimi remains a fugitive. One of his political allies said Sunday that he did not receive a fair trial because he was not in Baghdad for it. Nada al-Jabouri, a lawmaker in Iraqiya bloc, also criticized the timing of the sentence, as "Iraq is preparing for a big national reconciliation in the near future in order to achieve stability in this country." "This will not help," al-Jabouri said. Iraq's Central Criminal Court sentenced al-Hashimi's son-in-law Ahmed Qahtan to death alongside the politician. Qahtan is not in custody either. The death sentences are not final and can be appealed, Judicial Council spokesman al-Berqdar told CNN. Interpol issued a "red notice" for al-Hashimi in May, "on suspicion of guiding and financing terrorist attacks in the country." The notice calls on the 190 countries that belong to the international police organization to help locate and arrest him at the request of the Iraqi authorities. No apparent action has been taken to arrest him since the notice was issued four months ago. Al-Hashimi is now living in a Turkish government guest house in Istanbul. Before that, he lived in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region and also traveled to Saudi Arabia and Qatar at the invitation of those governments. In February, Iraq's top judicial committee accused al-Hashimi's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians from 2005 to 2011. Al-Hashimi said the nine-judge council was under the control of the Shiite-dominated central government and denied the charges. Charges against al-Hashimi appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men, identified as the vice president's security guards. Iraqi state television aired video of the confessions in December, but CNN has not been able to verify the men's identities independently. Among the confessions was one by a man who detailed roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009. The person speaking said orders at times came directly from al-Hashimi and at times through his son-in-law, Qahtan, who is also a senior member of his staff. Al-Hashimi did not immediately respond to the sentencing on Sunday.
Media magnate Rupert Murdoch will meet journalists at his News International subsidiary in London Friday, to take charge of the crisis surrounding the embattled Sun newspaper, with some speculating whether he will "sacrifice" UK staff to prevent the controversy from spilling across the Atlantic. "At the moment it appears he is ready to sacrifice the journalists and journalism in London to do whatever it takes to be seen to be cleaning up his act there so that it will play better in the United States," Andrew Neil, a former editor of Murdoch paper The Sunday Times, told CNN. "The consequence of that is quite amazing -- The Sun, which is the most loyal newspaper Murdoch has ever owned -- now believes it is being hung out to dry and the Sun journalists are turning against them." Murdoch issued a personal assurance to one of his executives that he'll continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Allegations of pay-offs to public officials by Sun employees -- five of whom were arrested Saturday -- threatens to bring the UK crisis across the shores to the U.S., where the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prevents companies from paying bribes overseas. "This is for Rupert Murdoch no longer about journalism. This is about defending News Corp., his American based parent company, from judicial action and investigation in the United States," Neil said. Such actions could put broadcast operations, the most profitable part of the News Corp. operations, in jeopardy, said Porter Bibb of Mediatech Capital Partners in New York. "If it can be proven that anybody working for News Corp. bribed or gave money to an official of a foreign government -- i.e. the UK -- that's a clear violation and the Justice Department will start the wheels in motion, and I think that's what Rupert Murdoch has been gearing up for in the past few months," Bibb said. All of the Sun employees were released on bail, and none so far have been charged. A wave of scandals This latest controversy surrounding Murdoch newspapers in the UK also raises a larger issue of journalists protecting confidential sources and paying to get information. If the case moves to the U.S., it raises the specter of anti-bribery laws in a showdown with the First Amendment, which protects freedom of the press. "It's really ironic that the greatest threat to freedom of the press in Great Britain today, and around the world today perhaps, has come from Rupert Murdoch because of his excesses," said Carl Bernstein, the Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist who, along with Bob Woodward, broke the Watergate series of stories that eventually led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The arrests of the Sun employees comes after Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World was found to have hacked into private voice mails of a widespread range of public officials, celebrities and victims of crime. The phone-hacking scandal prompted Murdoch's son, News Corp. executive James Murdoch, to shut down News of the World in July. The best-selling British newspaper was 168 years old. So far, News Corp. and its subsidiary companies have paid more than $200 million in legal fees and settling of 59 of 60 lawsuits that have been filed in the phone hacking case. Phone hacking: How the scandal unfolded James Murdoch is now facing new e-mail evidence that would have made him aware of widespread phone-hacking at the newspaper. The younger Murdoch has appeared twice before a UK investigatory committee and said he has no knowledge of the practice. While Murdoch started in newspapers, the UK division of his News Corp. empire -- which includes movie studio 20th Century Fox, the Fox Broadcasting Company and Harper Collins Publishers -- is only a $1.6 billion slice of the $32 billion empire. Dark side of the Sun "I can't imagine a corporate crisis that is larger than this," said Michael Wolff, a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and author of "The Man Who Owns the News: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch." "There are essentially two parts of the company: There's the American company which comprises most of the assets and earnings, and then there is the British company that is composed mostly of newspapers," Wolff told CNN. "That's kind of a legacy company. It's one of the places where Murdoch got his start and one of the places where his heart is. "Most of the News Corp. executives in America have been saying for a long time, `why do we have newspapers?'" Wolff said. "The legal jeopardy of his son and heir, James Murdoch, gets more and more dire every day. I think they need to do something big and final, and I think it's going to be getting rid of his UK business." The Sun's editor, Dominic Mohan, has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million. Paying for stories The arrests of journalists have spread alarm, and prompted an editorial by the Sun that police dawn raids against its journalists were part of a "witch-hunt" that had left Britain behind former Soviet states on press freedom. But there is a sense that the practices that helped Murdoch build his media empire are now threatening to bring it down. "This is a system that Rupert Murdoch set up, these are his values that the Sun has practiced, let's not kid ourselves about it any more than the atmosphere in the Nixon White House was about his aids and underlings," Bernstein said. "It's both a tragic story and story of real corruption -- institutional corruption, moral corruption of a journalistic institution, but at the same time we need to protect the principal of protecting sources." "Rupert Murdoch had tabloid view of journalism, probably still does, that you do whatever it takes to get the story. The end will justify the means. You've got to destroy the competition," said Neil, who worked with Murdoch for 11 years. Bernstein said there are circumstances where paying for information is permissible. "Such as if you are in Bosnia and you say to somebody, 'take me to a mass graves, I want to see the mass graves site'. (But) is it permissible while following the royals around to say, 'here's 100 pounds, tell me what the royal family was doing last night'? No. But at the same time, these bums ought to be protected along with those who practice real journalism.

ballooning by more than 150,000 since Sunday's miraculous win at Augusta. He still has some way to go to catch Tiger Woods, who has more than two million followers on both networking websites, but it could herald a brave new social media era for golf stars -- one which experts say may open the sport's doors to a previously ignored younger generation. "Golf has always been seen as a safe game. It's not overly flamboyant and I think it's still largely viewed as an elitist sport," Christian d'Ippolito, group head of international sales at UK-based social video advertising company Unruly Media, told CNN. "The fact that there is this guy who is quite an eccentric individual -- everything from his name, his dress sense, his pink driver -- certainly sets him apart from the crowd. "It's great because much like snooker, golf desperately needs that attention from a younger audience. And social media is an effective way of getting it. Every sport should have its personality, and football has been very good at that. I think Bubba is golf's answer to that personality." There's no denying Bubba's intriguing character. The devout Christian tweeted "To God be the Glory!" in response to his Masters win and bawled on his mother's shoulder after hitting an astonishing shot from the woods onto the green to take the title. Watson, who with wife Angie adopted a son, Caleb, two weeks ago, also boasts of never having a golf lesson. Last year he left more people scratching their heads when he and fellow PGA Tour players Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan launched boy band Golf Boys. Kitted out in nothing but a pair of overalls, Watson recorded the song "Oh Oh Oh" to help raise money for charity. But it's Bubba's dedication to social media which has given fans a special insight into his unconventional life. Incredibly, he replies to every single tweet, which no doubt helped to swell his legion of followers from 306,000 after his win on Sunday to more than 460,000 less than a day later. His Facebook page features albums of family vacations and home videos from fans' children practicing their best Bubba-style shots. Watson is quick to comment on every post from the public. "He's very engaged with social media. His music video had four million views and all these things help make Bubba a likeable character," d'Ippolito said. "They give him mass appeal, not like the seriousness you have with a traditional golfer." It also helps raise his profile among sponsors. Though as d'Ippolito admitted: "On the flipside, it does potentially make things difficult if things go wrong, as we saw with Tiger's romantic profile recently. Five years ago it was inconceivable that a sporting personality would have an entire global audience at his fingertips. It opens up a whole new debate on how much sponsors can control their stars. "It could work both ways -- some sponsors might be put off by his level of eccentricity."
Attorney General Eric Holder is calling on Congress to require companies to more quickly alert customers when their personal information is put at risk in cyberbreaches. In a video message Monday, Holder says "a strong, national standard for quickly alerting consumers whose information may be compromised ... would empower the American people to protect themselves if they are at risk of identity theft. It would enable law enforcement to better investigate these crimes -- and hold compromised entities accountable when they fail to keep sensitive information safe. " Federal law currently doesn't offer any standard for companies to notify customers following breaches, though some states have notification laws. Many companies are wary that public notification will hurt their business. Proposals in Congress to require a uniform notification and security standard have languished for years. Support for one bill proposed by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, has grown in the wake of the massive breach of retailer Target, which Holder says compromised personal information of up to 70 million people, including credit- and debit-card data of 40 million Target customers. Leahy's bill proposes to do much of what Holder is asking. Holder's proposal in some ways contrasts with how law enforcement has dealt with past breaches. During past cyber break-ins, investigators have asked companies to not immediately make the information public. In some cases, cybercriminals are known to return to exploit the vulnerabilities, and investigators may be able to gather evidence as new breaches occur. The rise of cybercrime in recent years has alarmed U.S. officials. One well-regarded report on data breaches produced by Verizon says there were 621 confirmed breaches in 2012, and that many breaches go unreported. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey told a Senate committee last fall that soon the cybercrime threat will equal or surpass the threat from terrorism. The Obama administration has come up with legislative proposals to better defend the country from cyberattacks but that effort has largely been shelved, a casualty of the controversy surrounding government surveillance after disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The NSA would be a lead agency in any national cyberstrategy, and the agency is politically damaged post-Snowden. One criticism of mandated notification is that the number of such reported crimes could overwhelm law enforcement. Holder, in his video message, says any legislation should also provide exemptions for minor breaches. Holder says the breach at Target and another retailer Neiman Marcus around Christmastime last year shows the need for better tools for law enforcement. "This legislation would strengthen the Justice Department's ability to combat crime and ensure individual privacy -- while bringing cybercriminals to justice," he says. Eric Holder becomes an activist attorney general
Interest in President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration is running so high that one ticket broker is asking $20,095 for a single ticket. The government has printed 250,000 tickets so far for Barack Obama's presidential inauguration on January 20. Entry to the biggest event in Washington is free if your congressman or senator grants your request, but with demand outpacing supply a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace. Legitimate ticket brokers -- the same companies that peddle tickets to rock concerts and NASCAR races -- are selling tickets to the swearing-in of Barack Obama for thousands of dollars, even for standing-room areas on the National Mall. Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the January 20 ceremony. "We think it's absolutely insane to be selling those tickets. We understand some people want to make a buck, but for those people thinking of buying tickets, it's buyer beware," warned Howard Gantman, staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.  Watch why the tickets are going for top dollar » The government has printed 250,000 tickets so far, holding them in a secure location. For information on how to get one, check out http://inaugural.senate.gov/. Ticket brokers act as middlemen, selling inaugural tickets they say they purchase from Capitol Hill employees and people who get them from members of Congress. Since the government releases tickets at the last minute -- less than a week before the inauguration -- ticket brokers cannot ensure they will receive enough tickets to cover their orders. Web sites promise a full refund if tickets are not secured to buyers, but that offer may be little consolation to people who invest in a trip to Washington to see the inauguration. Since tickets do not have attendees' names on them, Gantman said it's inevitable some will be sold. "Some will be distributed this way. It happens with baseball games and concerts. But we are going to take every step we can to make sure these tickets get into the hands of those who themselves intend to attend this event." Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the inauguration committee, said Monday she she was prepared to ask Congress to make it a crime to scalp inauguration tickets. "We have heard reports that there are people trying to scalp Inaugural tickets for more than $40,000 each. This is unconscionable and must not be allowed," Feinstein said in a statement. "This inauguration will be the major civic event of our time, and these tickets are supposed to be free for the people. Nobody should have to pay for their tickets," she added. The inaugural committee is alerting lawmakers that it is a violation of Congress' code of ethics for members or staff to sell their tickets.
When change comes, it comes all of a sudden, leaving only a remembrance of the past, a previous present, as its memorial. A moment as sudden as British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's realization that there was a "wind of change blowing through this continent, whether we like it or not" prior to the granting of independence to so many African people 50 years ago. It is this wind that now blows again over Africa. This time it is less political than economic but it will be just as permanent and just as shocking. And this time, it will not be awkward majors from disbanded colonial battalions muttering into their beer, it will be our well-meaning liberals that will be left behind, lumpen in its wake like a broken Luddite army. This change will not happen because of a million posters showing our babies starving with flies in their eyes or the perpetual funds raised for mosquito nets as a panacea against our ineffective drainage systems. Though the lives of many millions were saved by campaigns such as these. It will come as swift as our Tunisian Spring, a revolution sprung by social media, and as insistent as the ringtone of our mobile phones. Read this: Latest African gold rush - hotels Between 2000 and 2012, mobile penetration grew in Africa from 1% to 54%. Some predict that by 2014, 69% of mobiles on the continent will have internet access. This virtual infrastructure, plus the commodity boom, has meant that 7 out of 10 of the world's fastest growing economies including, yes, Ethiopia, the poster child of our Live Aid generation, are not in Asia but in Africa. This does not mean change will be evenly spread; it won't. The rapid urbanization and consequent youth unemployment will cause great hardship for many. The lack of administrative infrastructure to deal with this will ensure taxes are not collected and the facilities left to cope with this are not built or are built in the wrong place. Aid will continue to be a necessary feature of Africa But despite this the realization has come that Africa is not poor but inestimably rich. And that the outright despicable, as well as our supposed friends, have been writing cheques off our backs since the day they granted an indentured independence. History will show that Africa gave more than it ever received - it is the true donor nation. Yet despite this, Africa is throwing off its 300-year yoke. Much as China did. China, too, suffered its post-colonial period, drunk on nationalism and at best neglected by its dictators. And in many ways, Africa's growth patterns mirror those of the new China's. In 2010 China ranked first in exports to the world market, with merchandise export sales of more than $1.5 trillion and a world market share of 10.4%. In 1998, China had less than 2% of the world market. Africa has presently 3% but with 15% of the world's population, 60% of world's uncultivated arable land and a fast-growing proportion of the world's discovered valuable natural resources, Africa's potential for growth over the next 10 years is greater than China's over the same period. Read this: Africa's skyscraper cities Charles Robertson, Global Chief Economist of Renaissance Capital, estimates that Africa's GDP will increase from $2 trillion to $29 trillion in today's money by 2050. Africa will produce more GDP than the combined economies of the U.S. and Eurozone do today. In 2007, I co-hosted with the then Ghanaian president John Kufour, a dinner for 50 of the African presidents and explained how these changes would come. Back then, these words floated like fairy tales but they are becoming commonplace now in investment circles: Africa is Rising. Last week, I returned with my Made In Africa Foundation, this time to the African Development Bank (AfDB) during its annual general meeting, in its 50th Anniversary year, to ensure that as this growth happens it benefits not just everyone else in the developed and the BRIC economies but Africans as well and in a fundamental and equitable way. That's why I invited John Legend, Mos Def and Isaiah Washington, Youssou N'Dour and Akon to come along too, to advocate for the AfDB's audacious $68 billion PIDA plan to transform the continent in building railways, roads, clean water supplies and those things we take for granted -- the basic infrastructure of communication and trade to enable worthwhile lives for all our people. The AfDB's plan is to raise funds through a guarantee backed by the African nations: Africa helping Africans -- the ultimate trade-not-aid policy. As Mos Def said to the philanthropist Kola Aluko, one of Nigeria's richest men: "It's about self-sufficiency and about how Africa can benefit itself, having benefited so many nations through its natural resources, history, culture and its people and now it's about a fair exchange and what Africa can do for itself." Watch: Made in Africa Foundation I mixed these great talents from the diaspora and Africa in amongst the finance ministers, bankers and entrepreneurs. This is what a designer looks for: the harmony in contrasts. They find their common desire to make it happen -- one group bringing this solution to the global audience, giving it transparency and encouraging investment, and the other group implementing it. That's why I set up Made In Africa Foundation with the support of a fast-growing Nigerian business, Atlantic Energy. The message is quite simple: A small group of nations cannot forever benefit from keeping the majority of nations and people in a state of weakness. The peoples and continents of the world are not separate, they are part of the same social and economic system: a system that must return to balance and harmony. But this balance can only occur when Africa itself realizes that it is time for Africa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ozwald Boateng.
In most places, when 16 people are gunned down, the local media reports the incident without missing a beat. But when the massacre described above happened last weekend in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the editors of the city's largest daily newspaper had to have a long discussion before deciding to cover and investigate the story. As drug cartel violence continues unabated throughout Mexico, journalists find themselves walking a thin line between covering the story and becoming part of it. Already this year, three journalists have been killed in Mexico, reaffirming the country's place as one of the most dangerous in the world for journalists. The drug violence "generates fear, even if you don't like to admit it," Pedro Torres, deputy editor of El Diario de Juarez told CNN. Drug cartels have targeted reporters and editors who report on their activities, something that gives editors pause before reporting on incidents likely linked to the cartels. After discussion, the Juarez newspaper decided to investigate the gruesome slayings that happened over the weekend, but are aware of what that means. "We are always trying to investigate, but when you get too deep you draw a reaction," Torres said, referring to threats from drug traffickers. "In this case, we are trying to dig as deep as possible." However, if the paper's efforts are met with "reactions," they will have to back down, he said. It is a form of self-censorship that many media outlets in Mexico have accepted out of concern for the safety of their staffs. Sometimes, cartel members will call the newspaper to try to get reporters to not write about certain incidents; other times they push for certain stories to be included. "There's pressure from all sides," Torres said. In January, a crime reporter for the Zocalo newspaper in Saltillo, Mexico -- Valentin Valdes Espinosa -- was kidnapped. He was found dead shortly after, his body showing signs of torture and with several bullet wounds.. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Valdes Espinosa was found with a message that read: "This is going to happen to those who don't understand. The message is for everyone." Less than two weeks later, authorities in the state of Sinaloa found the body of another journalist who was kidnapped in December. Jose Luis Romero's body also showed signs of torture, CPJ reported. The most recent victim was Jorge Ochoa Martinez, a Mexican editor and publisher of two papers in the western state of Guerrero who died last week after being shot in the face, according to local media. The state attorney general's office told CNN Wednesday that there were two leads in the investigation, but that authorities were not ready to talk about them publicly yet. "Obviously, for this year, it's already an alarming figure," Anthony Mills, press freedom manager for the International Press Institute in Vienna, Austria, told CNN. "There appears to be no end in sight." "Although journalists continue bravely to do their jobs, the fact of the matter is that the systematic killing of journalists is going to have an effect on the job that journalists do," Mills added. Compounding the problem, Mills said, is either the inability or unwillingness of Mexican authorities to investigate violence against journalists. The Juarez paper had a reporter killed in 2008. Federal and local authorities visited the newspaper office and vowed to bring the killers to justice, "but in the end, nothing happens," Torres said. The case of the Juarez reporter, Armando Rodriguez, remains unsolved. Agustin Lozano, editor-in-chief of El Bravo newspaper in Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, said excessive caution has become the norm for reporting crime. "I don't want heroes here at my newspaper because it could be dangerous," Lozano told CNN. "We are reporters, we are not police." Matamoros has not seen as much violence as other border cities, but it is the home of the Gulf cartel. Out of an abundance of caution, Lozano's newspaper reports only on incidents that the police department gives news conferences or press releases about. Lozano said journalists are just the messengers who are getting caught in the middle of a conflict that is international in scope. Mexico, as a transport country for drugs, and the United States, as a consumer of drugs, have to work together to resolve the trafficking problem before journalists and others can be safe, he said. In the meantime, "there is no security, no guarantees." Despite the challenges and dangerous environment, Torres, the editor in Juarez, remains hopeful. "Our goal is to return to doing the type of journalism we were doing two years ago," before the violence there escalated, he said.
The timing and location of the Arapahoe High School shooting make it certain that memories of other mass shootings won't go away. Arapahoe happened one day before the anniversary of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting. It occurred within 17 miles of two other infamous Colorado gun rampagesâ€”the Aurora movie theater shooting and Columbine High. The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Karl Halverson Pierson, shot one student before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life, Sheriff Grayson Robinson said. Arapahoe is in suburban Denver. For some people, the tragedies are linked. A mother who picked up her child from Arapahoe shared her family's anguish. "My husband was a freshman at Columbine. He's freaking out right now," she told told CNN affiliate KCNC. "It's bringing back horrible memories of that. And it's just way too close to home." Newtown had hoped to quietly remember what happened on December 14, 2012. Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished Sandy Hook Elementary in what was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, following the April 2007 slaying of 32 people at Virginia Tech. City leaders asked journalists to stay away and give the community a chance to grieve, and many news organizations had said they would honor that request in some manner. It's not known if they'll stay away in light of Arapahoe. Newtown started an intense national conversation on gun safety but led to little legislative change. Connecticut authorities released a report last month saying they don't know what motivated Lanza, who briefly attended the school. He killed his mother before going to the school and killed himself. Arapahoe High is about 16 miles from Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman killed 12 people and wounded 58 on July 20, 2012, in a movie theater screening a new Batman film. James E. Holmes, then 24, was taken into custody outside the movie theater. Police said he was dressed head-to-toe in protective tactical gear and sprayed the theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns police recovered at the scene. Holmes had colored his hair red and told police he was "the Joker," police said. Jury selection for Holmes' trial was scheduled to begin in February, but the judge said that process could take eight months. The judge vacated the trial date and has not set a new date. Jordan Ghawi, whose sister was killed in Aurora, shared his feelings on Twitter: "Sitting here at the FD listening to @donlemon on @CNN as my hands are literally shaking. Rush of emotions ranging from solidarity to anger. "17 miles away from where my sister was killed. My thoughts are once again with Arapahoe Co and the State of Colorado." On April 20, 1999, the Columbine High mass shooting happened about 8 miles from Arapahoe High. Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher before fatally shooting themselves in the school library. SWAT teams entered Columbine 47 minutes after the shootings started. Five hours passed before law enforcement declared the school under control. In contrast, the first sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived at Arapahoe and entered almost immediately after the shooting was reported, Sheriff Grayson Robinson said. It is not known if law enforcement altered their protocols because of Columbine. Harris and Klebold made home videos before the attack making references to what they were going to do and apologizing to their parents for it. In the intervening years, Columbine has become a synonym for unfocused, violent teenage rage. Arapahoe is part of the Littleton Public School district and Columbine part of the Jefferson County School District.
it makes me feel part of the world, part of the Earth," she says. "I don't know how to explain it ... it's a little bit difficult ... but when I'm in the mountains, especially ski mountaineering, in winter alone, I have a peaceful feeling and I feel part of the things that surround me," she adds. "When I go up, I'm able to think of nothing -- it's as if your head is empty. For me, it's kind of a way to disconnect from the world." Today, under a canvas of blue sky that could have been painted by her namesake Joan Miro, the Catalan skier is quietly blazing a trail through the snowy terrain, negotiating the gentler slopes of the Pyrenees before effortlessly switching up a gear to tackle steeper climbs. "What I like in the mountains in winter is that you can choose your own trail. When I'm on the skis, I can always choose where I want to go." she explains. Combining elements of cross-country and alpine skiing, ski mountaineering, or "skimo" for short, can be done for recreation or competitively with skiers racing against the clock over a set pre-set course. "Senior women normally do 1,500 meters -- that's quite a lot, but we do three or four uphills and three or four downhills. The first women normally do that in one hour 30 minutes, one hour 40 minutes maximum -- (you are) always pushing yourself." There are dangers, notably avalanches when venturing off piste, but Miro has avoided them so far. "I'm lucky, I can say that I haven't had any really scary situations," she says. With around 25 races to complete every season, Miro has to constantly be in peak physical shape which means putting in the hard yards almost every day. The staggering uphill climbs she completes during a season -- more than 120 miles worth -- are as much a mental battle as a physical one, she says. "I think that the mind is the motor of the body. If your mind is ready, is open to new things, you will enjoy it. If your mind is closed and you don't want to improve, you won't enjoy it." With that philosophy, it is perhaps no wonder that the 26-year-old has been so successful winning dozens of races in recent years -- the high point coming in 2011 when she skied to both the World Championship and World Cup titles. Miro is also one of only a handful of women to have won the legendary Pierra Menta twice. The annual ski mountaineering race in the French Alps sees teams of two compete over four days on a monster of a course with elevations totaling 10,000 meters. "I was dreaming of (winning the) World Championships (and) I was dreaming of Pierra Menta, but I didn't expect to win them because I thought I would never have the level to do it. So when I won both, for me it was like, wow, this is one of the best moments of my life!" Unlike many skiing stars, Miro wasn't clipped into her bindings from an early age. In fact, she grew up in Barcelona on Spain's north-eastern coast more interested in swimming and martial arts. But annual summer holidays to the Pyrenees soon fostered a lasting affection for alpine activities. "My family took me to the mountains. We went for picnics, we went to see the lakes, we went to see animals, to see flowers but then when I was 12, I realized I wanted more. I wanted to learn more about mountains," she says. Her initial ski mountaineering outing was almost her last though. "The first time I went other people were telling me 'you will love it! You will enjoy the descents, it's very beautiful'. But I was so tired when I arrived at the summit that I couldn't get down. I just did one turn and fell on the ground! So it was like: 'I don't like this sport. It's too tiring!" A skiing career looked to have been stopped in its tracks before it had even started, but when she signed up for tests at a training center -- Catalonia's Ski Mountaineering Technical Center --  at the age of 17, it changed her mind and the course of her life forever. "I decided to go and just try and they picked me! That was the moment I started training and competing," she said. Miro was in good company at the center, counting superstar sky runner Kilian Jornet as one of her peers. Skyrunning is a sport that Miro also likes to compete in during the summer months, primarily as a way to keep fit for winter ski racing, although a troublesome knee hampered her progress in both activities last year. But the injury didn't completely ground her. "Last year, I started BASE jumping. It's very different from ski mountaineering or skyrunning but I love it ... It also makes me feel part of things that are around me and part of nature," she says. "With BASE jumping you realize that you are nothing and you have to take chances and you have to live your life every day and give all your energy to live it in the best way possible." Miro has recently made a return to the slopes and is currently competing at the Ski Mountaineering World Championships in Verbier, Switzerland. After feeling the thrill of jumping off tall buildings last summer, heading back to the slopes could have felt like a bit of a comedown. But the Catalan native is adamant that scaling snowy peaks will always rock her world. "I love ski mountaineering because it gives me the feeling of freedom. Ski mountaineering is part of me, I think that I need it."
As New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen accused former Sen. Scott Brown of "fear-mongering" on Ebola, Democrats strongly agreed, Republicans completely disagreed, and independent voters stayed neutral. That's according to the results of Microsoft Bing Pulse voting, where viewers reacted in real time to the CNN/NH1 New Hampshire Senate debate. The two candidates squared off on national issues such as Ebola, terror threats, immigration, Obamacare and the minimum wage. Democrats and Republicans intensely favored the view of their party's candidate, naturally disagreeing when the opponent retorted. Ebola, 'fear-mongering' dominate New Hampshire debate Independents, however, remained true to their individuality, by overall not aligning with a particular party or candidate. Brown blasted President Barack Obama's handling of the Ebola outbreak, saying if Romney were leading the nation, he would have minimized the threat and would have had a "clear and concise plan." Those words caused Republicans to strongly agree, while independents agreed less intensely in Brown's favor. When the debate turned to ISIS, independents aligned more with Democrats. Both groups agreed with Shaheen when she supported Obama's decision not to send U.S. ground troops to the Middle East. New Hampshire is known for its independent voters, who in September accounted for 43% of the state's electorate. The number of independent voters participating in Pulse was even higher, representing about two-thirds of participants. 'Rational fear' and 5 other key moments from debate When the results are broken down by gender, men and women did not line up on the same wavelength. Men and women both agreed when Brown criticized Shaheen for voting with Obama, but the genders diverged when Shaheen defended her support of the minimum wage, with women showing higher support. The highest volume of voting occurred after debate moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Brown whether he supports raising the minimum wage, and Brown referenced a time when he worked a minimum-wage job. "My first job was at Dunkin' Donuts cleaning the grease trap," recalled Brown. "I still remember what the smell is." New Hampshire was represented well in the Pulse audience, with 63% of participants saying they are registered voters of the Granite State.
The new football season is still some weeks away, but already in Italy allegations of racial abuse towards AC Milan's Kevin Constant have marred a friendly. The French-born Guinean player smashed the ball into the stands and walked off the pitch during Tuesday's friendly game against Sassuolo in the northern city of Reggio Emilia after becoming enraged by a section of supporters. The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) confirmed Wednesday that it was examining the incident. "The Federal Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation to ascertain the extent of the racist incident that took place yesterday evening at the Stadio del Tricolore in Reggio Emilia during the Milan-Sassuolo match (Trofeo TIM), which saw AC Milan player Kevin Constant the subject of chants from some supporters in the stands" said the FIGC statement. In January, Constant's teammate Kevin Prince-Boateng walked off the field of play after being racially abused by a number of fans during a friendly game against Pro Patria with six people hit with two-month prison sentences. However Milan said that Constant's decision to leave the field was "not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make." "On the evening of July 23rd 2013 there was another episode involving racist intolerance and this time the victim was Kevin Constant, who reacted by leaving the field of play," read the Milan statement. "This was not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make and despite his more than understandable reasons and the anger he must have felt, AC Milan would like to remind everyone that the only people responsible for intervening against any manifestations that offend the human dignity, which includes racial discrimination, are the referee in charge of the match and the head of public safety. "The use of the legal system and institutional rights, which every member of the public requires to exist in a civil society, does not compensate for the fact that these episodes continue to happen at a frequent rate." Both Constant and Prince-Boateng declined to be interviewed by CNN, while Sassuolo issued the following statement on its website. "With reference to the incident that occurred during the Trofeo TIM, Sassuolo Calcio await the results of the investigation and fully condemn any racist expression," it read. "In any case, we also underline the extraordinary fair play of Sassuolo fans in general. Over the years and during the Trofeo TIM last night they supported their team with the utmost sporting values, never transcending into vulgar chants and ensuring visiting fans enjoyed their hospitality." The incident is the latest in a long line of unsavory episodes of racism which have dogged Italian football in recent times. Only last May, the FIGC itself came under fire from FIFA president Sepp Blatter after the Italian organization fined Roma $65,000 after its fans were found guilty of racially abusing Milan's Mario Balotelli. "You will always find money," Blatter told the world governing body's website at the time. "What is $65,000 for such an incident? I'm not happy and I will call the Italian Federation. That's not a way to deal with such matters." In April, Inter Milan were fined nearly $60,000 by European governing body UEFA after its fans were found guilty of "improper conduct" in chants directed towards Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor. Two months earlier, Lazio received its fourth charge of racist behavior this season -- with Roma's city rivals having been fined nearly $300,000 after repeated fan transgressions. In May, FIFA adopted tougher penalties for racist behavior during its congress in Mauritius. Punishments for first offenses bring a warning, fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed "serious," could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament. FIFA also confirmed that any individual found guilty of racist chanting will be suspended for at least five matches. According to UEFA guidelines, which are adhered to by all professional clubs in Europe, there is a three-step procedure for abandoning games if they are marred by racist chanting. First, the referee should halt the contest and ask for announcements to be made over the public address system. The second step would be to suspend the match for a given period of time and, finally, abandon it.
With all passengers and crew aboard Asiana Airlines Flight 214 from Seoul now accounted for, air crash investigators are beginning the painstaking search for clues as to why the incident, which killed at least two people, happened. While the sequence of events that led to accident remains unclear, witnesses described hearing a "boom" as the Boeing 777 appeared to come in short, touching down heavily on the runway close to the water's edge at San Francisco International Airport before it disappeared in a cloud of smoke. Parts of the aircraft, including its tail section and engines, snapped off as it spun off the tarmac on its belly. Passenger: 'I just crash landed at SFO. I'm ok. Surreal' "For whatever reason, the pilot did not have enough power available to correct the rate of descent that brought him into contact with the ground before he wanted to be there," Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and former airline pilot, told CNN. "There are a number of other considerations that may or may not have been made clear: One of them has to do with the fact that at least on one other occasion -- with a [Boeing] 777 in London -- they were on approach to land and they also ended up landing short. It's my understanding that it was all because of a fuel situation. For one reason or another, the throttles were moving but the engines were not increasing their thrust. Therefore they landed short of the runway and short of the power they needed to continue with a safe landing." British Airways Flight 38 from Beijing landed short of the runway at London's Heathrow airport in January 2008 after losing critical power as it prepared to touch down. Fortunately, the pilot was able to partially control the impact, allowing everyone on board to escape serious injury. Investigators believe the incident was caused by ice in the fuel system of the Boeing 777. Their report suggested the aircraft passed through unusually cold air over Siberia as it traveled from the Chinese capital. "Mechanical things can be present in these airplanes that will make it impossible for the crew to do the things that they know how to do," Tilmon added. Todd Curtis, a former Boeing aviation safety engineer, agreed Flight 214's touch down point was far shorter than intended. "It should never even have been close to hitting the seawall at the edge of the runway like that," he said. Curtis said the pilot rather than the computer would have been in control at this point. "Typically the pilot would be hand-flying the plane right at the final approach. This was a relatively good-weather day. They didn't have to have a full auto-land system in place -- even when you have a lot of automated systems right before touch down, you're going to have the pilots under positive control of the aircraft," he said. "As for why it hit the runway the way it did, or how fast it was, it depends in the weight of the aircraft and other factors. But this is something that has to be discovered through the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder. "How fast this aircraft was going, both horizontally along the ground and its vertical speed, that may be the critical factor that made it land so short. "The initial impact was strong enough to cause both horizontal stabilizers and the vertical fin to come off the aircraft. This was major, major structural damage, which made it very difficult to control the aircraft." Flight data recorders recovered from crash Curtis said investigators would be keen to speak to the crew as soon as possible. "Of course we have all sorts of information from the 'black boxes' but the state of mind of the pilots -- why they made the decisions they did prior to landing -- is something that would be very important to know. "Also, from outward appearances, until the very end of the flight it looks as though things on the flight were normal. One question I would like to ask those pilots is: 'was there anything going on in the minutes or hours leading up to the landing where you were taken off your usual schedule, where you doing things not on the checklist, where you are not following procedures? Was there anything out of place or out of the ordinary?'" Why crash was survivable
Dennis Ross, one of the president's top advisers dealing with Middle East policy, announced Thursday he's stepping down from his post, leaving prospects for the administration's efforts to restart the peace process even more uncertain. He cited a promise he made to his wife to serve in the Obama administration for only two years. Ross, who has held key diplomatic positions during the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton as well as Barack Obama, issued a statement saying, "It has been an honor to work in the Obama administration and to serve this president, particularly during a period of unprecedented change in the broader Middle East." He added, "Obviously, there is still work to do, but I promised my wife I would return to government for only two years and we both agreed it is time to act on my promise. "I am grateful to President Obama for having given me the opportunity once again to work on a wide array of Middle Eastern issues and challenges and to support his efforts to promote peace in the region." Ross's formal title is special assistant to the president and senior director for the "central region," the key area that includes Israel, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf, and South Asia. His influence is hard to understate, having been handed a portfolio that includes the United States' most pressing national security interests and regions that have undergone significant turmoil over the past two years. Ross' departure comes at a particularly difficult time for the Obama administration, which has at times clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Middle East peace process and is dealing with the unpredictable aftermath of the Arab Spring. The departure also follows that of the special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, who left the administration in May, only days before Netanyahu visited the White House. During his daily briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called Ross a "remarkable contributor to this administration." "He is ... very much a part and an architect of the sanctions regime and efforts to pressure and isolate Iran, and has been at the forefront of our deliberations about handling the Arab Spring, the remarkable events we have seen in the Middle East and North Africa this year," Carney said. Asked how Ross' departure would affect the administration's efforts to forge a Middle East peace agreement, Carney said the White House will "build on the good work he has done."
pro-nuclear environmentalists? Isn't that an oxymoron? Apparently, not so much anymore. Embracing nuclear is the only way, the scientists believe, to reverse the looming threat of climate change which they blame on fossil fuels. Depending who you ask, they're either abandoning -- or leading -- traditional environmentalists who for a half-century have rejected clean-burning nuclear power as too expensive or too dangerous. Opponents cite disasters at Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile island. Related: Fukushima update The fear is that time is running out. Without nuclear, the scientists believe global energy consumption will overtake the planet's ability to reverse the buildup of carbon dioxide pollution from burning oil, coal and other fossil fuels. At risk, said Hansen, are disintegrating polar ice sheets and rising sea levels which will threaten coastal regions. The letter is among the scientists' strongest public statements backing nuclear power. It also comes as CNN plans to air "Pandora's Promise," a documentary about environmentalists and longtime nuclear opponents who've done complete 180s on nukes. By releasing the letter, the scientists are "putting their reputations on the line to do something that the ultra-greens regard as treason," said Stanford University Nobel-winning physicist Burton Richter. Nuclear power is burgeoning in some parts of the world and shrinking in others. Asia is embracing it -- except Japan -- which is still struggling to figure out how to safely deal with the dangerously radioactive Fukushima nuclear power plant. The Japanese disaster left Germany so unnerved that they've chosen to phase out their 17 nuclear facilities by 2022. "We've got four top guns in the environmental movement telling [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel, 'You're wrong to shut down nuclear,'" said Richter. "I think that's a relatively big deal." Are we witnessing the birth of a mutiny within the environmental movement? Will typical 21st-century environmentalists eventually embrace the power of the atom? A leading environmental group opposed to nuclear power says no. "I don't think it's very significant that a few people have changed their minds about nuclear power," said Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Nuclear fuel may burn cleaner, the NRDC says, but comes with too many safety issues and too high of a price tag. The letter admits "today's nuclear plants are far from perfect." However, "... there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power." Read the letter The four scientists say they have no connection to "Pandora's Promise," which blames resistance to nuclear energy on groundless fears rooted in the Cold War, Chernobyl in 1986 and 1979's Three Mile Island. Related: Chernobyl's local health problems Map: Closest nukes to your home In the documentary, which debuts on CNN Thursday at 9 p.m. ET/PT, climate change activist and author Mark Lynas says he knew publicly supporting nuclear energy would put his entire career at risk. "I'd have been much better just to keep my mouth shut," he admits in the film. "But I couldn't do that." Cavanagh said the "movie attempts to establish the proposition that mainstream environmentalists are pouring into nuclear advocacy today. They aren't. I've been in the NRDC since 1979. I have a pretty good idea of where the mainstream environmental groups are and have been. I've seen no movement." Selling nuclear energy to environmentalists is a tough pitch. Hansen acknowledged that many of them won't easily buy into it. Parts of the community operate like "a religion of sorts, which makes it very difficult," Hansen said. "They're not all objectively looking at the pros and cons." The NRDC hasn't rejected nuclear power out of hand, Cavanagh said. It constantly evaluates nuclear power and "everything else," he said. "I think that's our obligation." Is it possible to be both an environmentalist and a supporter of nuclear power? "You can be," Cavanagh said. Hansen has been spreading his message to the community's top influencers. He tells of a recent meeting with Al Gore where he tried to sell the former vice president on how advanced nuclear technology might stabilize climate change. Gore invited two anti-nuclear advocates to the meeting, Hansen said, and by the time it was all over, Gore was unmoved. "I mean, Al essentially understands that we had better try to develop safer, better nuclear power," said Hansen, "but he won't come out and say that." Here's what Gore did say publicly about it during a recent Reddit "Ask Me Anything" chat: nuclear energy "will continue to play a limited role, and IF the ongoing [research and development] produces cheaper, safer, smaller reactors, they may yet play a more significant role." Decarbonizing Among nuclear energy supporters, France remains a hero nation. In the 1970s, it chose to invest heavily in nuclear power creating a system that boasts some of the cheapest energy and cleanest air on the planet. Germany puts out about 18% of its power with nuclear. But with the upcoming nuke phase-out, there are doubts about whether Germany can offset its nuclear output with wind and other clean energy sources. Michael Limburg, vice president of the European Institute for Climate and Energy, told CNN in September that the government's energy targets are "completely unfeasible." "Of course, it's possible to erect tens of thousands of windmills but only at an extreme cost and waste of natural space," he said. "And still it would not be able to deliver electricity when it is needed." There are 65 commercially operating nuclear plants in the U.S., including 104 reactors. Five new reactors are currently being built, in Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. In the past year, utilities have permanently shut down four others and plan to take a fifth out of service in 2014. At least two other planned projects have been shelved. "Nuclear power is dying a slow death in the market place, which is what matters in determining its future," said Cavanagh. As an alternative, the NRDC is touting efficiency. Energy-saving technology is becoming so successful, according to a new NRDC report, that efficiency has "significant potential to dramatically reduce power plant emissions." Total U.S. energy use peaked in 2007 and has been trending downward ever since, the NRDC says. On the other hand, scientists in "Pandora's Promise" claim energy consumption globally could double by 2050 -- and perhaps triple or quadruple by 2100 -- as growing nations like China, India and Brazil start to want more energy. A United Nations report released last month re-confirmed Hansen's fears. The study concluded that the planet is heating up, the oceans are rising and there's more evidence that neither development is natural. Hansen, who was among the initial wave of scientists warning about climate change in the 1980s, said Friday he fears most its "irreversible effects." "Once we get to a certain point and the ice sheets start to disintegrate, then you can't stop it." Then Hansen paused. "And we're getting very close to that point." If we stay on the current path, he said, "those are the consequences we'll be leaving to our children. The best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power. It's ready now. We need to take advantage of it." CNN's Matt Smith and Oliver Joy contributed to this report.
her boyfriend and golf star, Tiger Woods. "Tiger and I both went through rehab with our injuries at a similar time, so we were both in the gym together and pushing each other and motivating each other, both frustrated," Vonn said. "I think we both helped each other a lot through that time, and I drew a lot of inspiration from him and I think he does the same with me. "We continue to push each other and it's a really positive relationship in that way." Woods' own injury problems began after a promising start to 2014. The 14-time major champion regained the World No 1. spot in March but was unable to recapture the form that took him there after undergoing back surgery shortly afterwards. A poor summer meant Woods dropped out of contention for a place in the U.S.'s ill-fated Ryder Cup team. Given his high profile and status within the golfing community, much of the media attention in the run up to the Ryder Cup focused on Woods' absence. Being a star that transcends her own sport in a similar manner, Vonn can empathize as to the added pressure that the unflinching glare of the spotlight can bring. "For us, we're just two athletes trying to do the best we can in our sports," she said. "There's other stuff that goes along with it for both of us, there's media and stuff like that." Vonn recently criticized a satirical article published in the Golf Digest magazine that poked fun at Woods. She said she was proud of her boyfriend for taking a stand in criticizing the piece and described much of the reaction surrounding his response as "completely ridiculous" in quotes carried by USA Today. Vonn is more laid back discussing media relations today. Although not directly referring to that incident in particular, she said the attention is "all part of sports and part of being a successful athlete. We both understand that and take it in our stride." A chipper Vonn even revealed the celebrity pair are intensively competitive with one another. Responding to a question on whether her golf is better than Tiger's skiing, Vonn said that was perhaps too difficult to say. "It's tricky -- I have a hole in one. But he's a pretty good skier." "We're highly competitive. We're competing at every single thing that we can. And unfortunately he holds the record in ping-pong. "I have only one victory to I don't know how many hundreds he has." "He's pretty much better than me at everything, except skiing, so unfortunately he's the winner of the two of us."
Women have been badly let down by the men they stood with during demonstrations that toppled tyrants in the Middle East and North Africa. Shot at, tortured, assaulted and detained -- they were equals at the point of protest but now, as new governments extend their grip, we can see that, as citizens, women remain firmly in the second class. So, as we celebrate the role of women on International Women's day, let us not forget that the struggle for equality is far from won. Even when progress seems to be a given, the pendulum can swing back leaving fresh challenges to defend progressive values. In Egypt, it did not matter that women had played a critical role in the uprisings that ousted the tyrant Mubarak. It did not matter that they had suffered equally from repression and lack of economic opportunity along with the men. It did not matter that they were subjected to the additional burden of discrimination because they were female. It did not matter that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces tried to discredit women protestors by arresting them and subjecting them to forced virginity tests. When elections finally came after so many years of dictatorship, Amnesty International asked political parties in Egypt to make commitments to basic human rights principles: principles such as freedom of expression and assembly, religious freedom, non-discrimination and gender equality. Most of those seeking political power through the parliamentary elections fell short of meeting even these minimum human rights commitments. Read also: Women and the Arab uprisings The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party which won 235 seats -- 47 per cent of the total - failed even to respond to Amnesty International's request. The Salafist Al-Nur party, which came second with 121 seats (24 per cent) declined to promote women's rights or abolish the death penalty. So 71% of the new parliament is unwilling to commit to promoting women's rights and gender equality. There have been some chinks of light. Tawakkol Karman of Yemen was named as one of three women Nobel Laureates for peace, in an important, though, belated recognition of the role women have played in the protests dubbed the Arab Spring. During those heady days, women were a powerful voice, a compelling presence in the protests. They took the same risks as men when exposing human rights abuses committed by the state and calling for accountability; as leaders and agents of change in the uprisings they have not been exempt from the worst of the violence. Many women protesters were harassed, arrested, tortured and otherwise ill-treated in gender-specific ways just because they are women, defying convention and exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. In Bahrain, where thousands of women took part in anti-government demonstrations, dozens were arrested and some were reportedly tortured or otherwise ill-treated. In Yemen, women taking part in protests and women activists have been killed, harassed, arrested and in some cases beaten for their participation in protests. In a desperate attempt to sideline women, Yemeni officials demanded that male relatives assert control over the women in their family and stop their activism. Read also: Women prisoners find freedom behind bars However, women's protest is not new in this region: women were demanding their human rights long before the start of the uprisings of the last year -- in Iran and elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, 20 years after women first sat at the wheels of their cars and challenged the restriction on females driving, the ban remains in place. Any woman who dares to challenge the ban faces arrest and attacks on their character. Saudi religious clerics have claimed that allowing women to drive would lead to moral decline in the kingdom. The demands of the women are clear. Women want a seat at the table and a voice in the debate and a vote in the decision making. More specifically, women are calling for equal rights to political participation and decision-making, equal rights in law, including in relation to marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance. Women must have legal protection from gender-based violence, including domestic violence and marital rape, and sexual harassment. International Women's Day is an opportunity to recognize the courage and stamina of the women living in the Middle East and North Africa. They will not be pushed back to the kitchen. We must all take a stand today in solidarity with them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Widney Brown
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Tuesday that he has been the victim of racial profiling but believes Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. could have been more patient with the police officer who arrested him. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell told Larry King that    he has been subject to racial profiling. At the same time, Powell also faulted the Cambridge (Massachusetts) Police Department for escalating the situation beyond a reasonable level. "I think Skip [Gates], perhaps in this instance, might have waited a while, come outside, talked to the officer and that might have been the end of it," Powell said in an interview with CNN's Larry King. "I think he should have reflected on whether or not this was the time to make that big a deal.  Watch what Powell would advise Gates » "I think in this case the situation was made much more difficult on the part of the Cambridge Police Department," Powell said. "Once they felt they had to bring Dr. Gates out of the house and to handcuff him, I would've thought at that point, some adult supervision would have stepped in and said 'OK look, it is his house. Let's not take this any further, take the handcuffs off, good night Dr. Gates.' " Gates, a top African-American scholar, was arrested July 16 for disorderly conduct outside his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home after police responded to a report of a possible burglary. The charge was later dropped. Powell said that under the circumstances, Gates may not have been in the appropriate frame of mind to best handle the situation. "He was just home from China, just home from New York. All he wanted to do was get to bed. His door was jammed and so he was in a mood where he said something," Powell said. He recalled a lesson he was taught as a child: "When you're faced with an officer who is trying to do his job and get to the bottom of something, this is not the time to get in an argument with him. "There is no African-American in this county who has not been exposed to this kind of situation," Powell said. "Do you get angry? Yes. Do you manifest that anger? Do you protest? Do you try to get things fixed? But it's the better course of action to try and take it easy and don't let your anger make the current situation worse." The former secretary of state said he has been racially profiled "many times," including an incident that took place while he was the national security adviser to President Reagan. "Nobody thought I could possibly be the national security adviser to the president. I was just a black guy at Reagan National Airport," Powell said. "And it was only when I went to the counter and said, 'Is my guest here waiting for me?' that someone said, 'Oh, you're Gen. Powell.' It was inconceivable to him that a black guy could be the national security adviser." When asked how he dealt with the situation, Powell said, "You just suck it up -- what are you going to do? It was a teaching point for him. 'Yes, I'm the national security adviser, I'm black, and watch, I can do the job.' " In the interview, Powell touched on other issues, ranging from North Korea to U.S. figures such as Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh. While North Korea may be "bizarre," he said, their negotiators are second to none. "They are some of the best, toughest negotiators I've ever dealt with," Powell said. "And you can read the whole history of our negotiations with North Korea, going back to the Korean armistice discussion, and you'll find they know what their negotiating positions are, and they will drive you crazy, and they will use your impatience against you." The former secretary praised the United States' current top diplomat, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Powell said Clinton was handling North Korean relations "properly" by insisting that dialogue with Pyongyang be limited to the six-party framework. Powell said Clinton seems to be "in the mold of almost all secretaries I have known." Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, he said, is a "fascinating figure ... you have got to hand it to her." Palin transferred power to Gov. Sean Parnell on Sunday. He repeated his assessment that the former Republican vice presidential candidate had not been ready for the Oval Office last fall, but said she was worth watching. "Apparently, she is going to re-enter public life ... . We will have to see what her plans are," he said Tuesday. "I don't know if she is doing all of this for political purposes or just to start a new life in the wonderful world of speaking. And we will all be watching with great interest." Powell, who has previously been critical of radio host Rush Limbaugh, restated his opinion that members of his party ought to do the same. "The problem I'm having with the [Republican] Party right now is that when he says something that I consider to be completely outrageous and I respond to it, I would like to see other members of the party do likewise, but they don't," he said.  Watch Powell talk about Limbaugh and the GOP » Asked whether he thinks Republicans are afraid to take on Limbaugh, Powell pointed out that several prominent Republicans have criticized Limbaugh but that "within 24 hours, they were backing away because there is a strong base of support for Mr. Limbaugh." Powell discussed his reaction to the news that then-Sen. Barack Obama had won the presidency. "I cried," he said. Powell was in Hong Kong to speak to Chinese leaders, and it was late morning in Hong Kong when the final votes were cast in the United States. "I just sat down in a chair and said 'By God, we did it.' There were people who said America could not do this, America would not do this, but he did do it." The former top diplomat also had some advice for now-President Obama. "Everybody comes into office -- the new president -- and they're told by everybody 'You've got to get it all done in the first year.' Or 'the first hundred days are important,'" Powell said. " ... You have to have a main attack, as we say in the military. You have to make sure you're focusing on things that are most important. Not try to have a dozen main attacks at once because you end up sort of frittering your energy and your troops. "Now President Obama is out there trying to solve all of the problems he said he would solve. And I think that he and his staff over time will start to do a better job, in my judgment, of setting priorities." Powell didn't limit his advice to the president. He also offered counsel to his party. "If the party is going to succeed in the future, the advice I'm giving to my Republican friends is you've got to find some way to reach out and draw moderates and independents more toward the right so that we can build a party that will win," Powell said. "A base, as I've said before -- the base is no particular use if all you can do is sit on it and you can't build on it."
Mexico's government must create jobs and improve education to help fight drug trafficking, the country's senate president said in an interview with CNN en Espanol. "Together they form a true strategy for fighting crime and violence," said Sen. Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera, a top official in Mexico's opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party. Currently, Mexico's war on drugs is a "fight of firepower between criminals and the state," he said. "We have seen 30,000 people die in the past four years," Beltrones said. "And we are very close to seeing, at the end of this six-year term, an equal number of dead as in the Vietnam War." Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office at the end of 2006. Since then, more than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence across the country. And Calderon's government has dispatched about 50,000 troops to the nation's trouble spots. A past governor of Sonora state, which borders Arizona, Beltrones also discussed California's recently defeated proposition to legalize marijuana. Proposition 19, which failed to garner enough support from California voters earlier this month, left many Mexican lawmakers wondering what they would do if it had passed, he said. California has already legalized medical marijuana. Supporters of Proposition 19 argued that the "prohibition" of marijuana -- much like that for alcohol decades ago -- has created a violent criminal black market, led today by international drug cartels. But opponents prevailed earlier this month. Still, Beltrones said the debate over legalizing marijuana is an issue Mexican officials will have to tackle "sooner or later." "But we could not do it without developing a strategy with the United States, which is the drug's largest consumer... Crime and drug trafficking, which are transnational problems, need international solutions," he said. CNN en Espanol's Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.
The death toll from Friday's attacks on a religious minority in Lahore has risen to 98, officials said Saturday. The strikes with bombs and firearms took place at two mosques in Lahore belonging to the Ahmadi religious group, police and rescue officials said. At the Baitul Noor place of worship in the Model Town region, two attackers on motorbikes fired at the entrance of the building and tossed hand grenades, a rescue official told CNN. Police said one of the attackers was critically injured. The other, clad in a suicide jacket, was detained. At a mosque in the Garhi Shahu neighborhood, one witness told CNN he saw two attackers armed with AK-47s, and another witness said he saw at least four gunmen. Sajjad Bhutta, the senior official, said the heads of three suicide bombers were discovered there. Bhutta said more than 70 people were injured in the violence. Ahmadis regard themselves as Muslim. But the government says they aren't, and many Muslim extremists have targeted them. Sunni and Shiite Muslims do not regard followers of the religion as Muslims because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a non-governmental organization, deplored the attacks and said it has warned the Punjab provincial government about threats to the Ahmadi community center in Model Town for more than a year. Lahore is the capital of Punjab province. . "An HRCP delegation had held meetings with Chief Minister Punjab Shehbaz Sharif to apprise him of the situation and had demanded enhanced security measures to protect the vulnerable minority and its worship places. HRCP is of the view that though the Punjab government apparently took some steps to bolster the security ... they were not enough to face the well-coordinated and well-planned terrorist attack as witnessed on Friday," it said. It urged the government "to provide foolproof security and protection to the Ahmadi community." The movement was founded in 1889. Its followers believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908) was sent by God as a prophet "to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality, justice and peace," the worldwide Ahmadi group says. The group, which is thought to number between 3 million and 4 million people in the country, endures "the most severe legal restrictions and officially sanctioned discrimination" among Pakistan's religious minorities, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. The religious freedom commission, an independent, bipartisan U.S. government body, said in its latest annual report that "Ahmadis may not call their places of worship 'mosques,' worship in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer rooms which are otherwise open to all Muslims, perform the Muslim call to prayer, use the traditional Islamic greeting in public, publicly quote from the Koran, or display the basic affirmation of the Muslim faith." The agency says it's illegal for the group to preach publicly, pursue converts or pass out religious material, and adherents are restricted from holding public conferences and traveling to Saudi Arabia for the hajj pilgrimage. While the greatest number of its followers are in Pakistan and India, it has a presence in many European countries, such as Britain, where the religion's fifth and current spiritual head, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, resides.
The BBC is refusing to broadcast a plea from leading British charities for aid to Gaza, saying the ad would compromise the public broadcaster's appearance of impartiality. Demonstrators protest at the BBC's central London offices Saturday against the broadcaster's decision. The decision prompted weekend protests in England and Scotland, with one group saying Sunday that 100 people had occupied the foyer of the BBC building in Glasgow, Scotland and would not leave until the BBC runs the ad. The Disasters Emergency Committee, which includes the British Red Cross, Oxfam, Save the Children and 10 other charities, plans to launch the ad on Monday. British broadcasters, led by the BBC, originally declined to air the appeal -- but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 changed their minds. CNN was not approached to broadcast the ad, a DEC spokesman said. About 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London on Saturday over the broadcaster's stance. Seven people were arrested.  Watch protest against BBC decision » In Glasgow, the London-based Stop the War Coalition said Sunday its supporters had moved into the foyer of the BBC building in what the group described as a peaceful protest. The group did not plan to move beyond the foyer but intended to stay there until the BBC changes its decision, said Keith Boyd, a coalition member who called CNN on Sunday. "Primarily we are asking that the ad be shown," Boyd said. The BBC press office would not confirm whether its Glasgow office was being occupied or if protesters were even there. "We don't comment on individual demonstrations," a statement from the BBC press office said. The BBC is standing by its decision to not air the ad, director general Mark Thompson wrote in a blog post on the corporation's Web site. "We concluded that we could not broadcast a free-standing appeal, no matter how carefully constructed, without running the risk of reducing public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in its wider coverage of the story," he wrote Saturday. "Inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programs but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations. The danger for the BBC is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story," Thompson said. "Gaza remains a major ongoing news story, in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict, the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious," he added. The BBC, which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every British household with a television, is required by its charter to be impartial. It does not carry commercial advertising but does broadcast charity appeals. The DEC is "disappointed that the BBC declined to support the Gaza appeal," the spokesman told CNN. "It might limit the reach of our key message to the general public." The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the BBC had to make its own decision about impartiality. "That is a decision they must make. We have no view on that subject," he said. Many readers of Thompson's blog post did have a view, however. The statement got hundreds of comments, most of them critical of the BBC. A commenter who signed in as "bully--baiter" said the BBC was taking a side, no matter what it did. "Sorry Mr. Thompson but you cannot have it both ways. If deciding to accede to the DEC request would be seen as political then deciding not to accede to it is also political. Don't insult me with your disingenuous attempts to suggest it is otherwise," the commenter wrote. Other commenters simply rejected Thompson's position out of hand. "I think the reasons for blocking help for a grave humanitarian disaster are simply astounding," "brit--proud" wrote. "How can simply bringing food, medicines and homes to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians be seen as political impartiality? How stupid do the BBC think the British public are?" But the corporation had its defenders as well. "The last thing I want to do, is fund the BBC to broadcast propaganda," "SternG" wrote: "There's no way I will pay the BBC to air the DEC's politically-motivated 'appeal' for Gaza. Gaza is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group, including by the EU. There is no doubt that some aid/fund will be 'procured' by Hamas. ... Good decision BBC." British broadcasters have refused to air some previous DEC appeals, the umbrella organization's spokesman said. A planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in Lebanon was scrapped because "there were genuine concerns, shared by the aid agencies, about the deliverability of aid." Thompson cited doubts about whether DEC members could get aid to Gaza as a secondary reason for declining to take the ad.
A Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his chest. Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become "almost epidemic," according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, "All they told us was maybe we should move." "I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details." the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted » Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. "It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses," according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Colorado's witness protection program is a "joke," according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly. Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, "I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection." Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. "I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness," she said. Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. "I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life," Rhonda Fields told CNN. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed. E-mail to a friend
A massive winter storm has left at least 17 people dead and more than a million homes across the Midwest without power, according to reports from several state emergency management agencies. A tree pulls on utility lines Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky, in a photo from iReporter Jacek Jasinski. Almost half those households are in Kentucky, where 45 shelters have been set up to help residents battling icy conditions, a spokesman for the governor's office said. "One of our biggest concerns is [providing] power generators, especially for nursing homes out in the western part of the state that are without power," Jay Blanton, spokesman for Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, said Wednesday.

Some foreign students who enroll and graduate from U.S. flight schools are in the U.S. illegally, despite extensive post-9/11 efforts to vet student pilots, congressional investigators said Wednesday. Stephen Lord, an investigative chief with the Government Accountability Office, declined to say how many student pilots he found to be wrongly in the country, saying that the Transportation Security Administration had deemed the number to be "sensitive security information." But, he said, his study showed "weaknesses" in the TSA's vetting process that need to be fixed. The holes are "extremely disturbing," House Homeland Security subcommittee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers said. "It's completely unacceptable that a decade after 9/11 GAO has uncovered weaknesses in our security controls that were supposed to be fixed a decade ago," Rogers said. Several of the terrorists who carried out the attacks of September 11, 2001, including leader Mohammed Atta, trained at U.S. flight schools before conducting their attack, and government leaders vowed to prevent such a mistake from happening again. For illegal immigrant graduates, a 'leap of faith' answered Today, the TSA vets foreign student pilots against terror watch lists and conducts fingerprint-based criminal background checks, but it does not vet them against immigration databases, the GAO lead investigator said. Lord said his group downloaded an FAA database of pilots and compared it to TSA's database of student pilots who had completed background checks. "In a perfect world, the two databases would match," Lord said. "But we were surprised to find that some ... of the foreign nationals holding pilots' licenses were not in the TSA's databases, indicating that some foreign nationals had not been vetted before receiving flight training, and ultimately receiving pilots' licenses." The hole first came to public light in 2010 when local police stopped the owner of a Massachusetts flight school for a traffic violation and discovered he was in the country illegally. Federal immigration officials investigated and found that 25 of the foreign nationals at the school had been vetted by the TSA and had been approved to begin flight training. But further investigation revealed that eight of the students had entered the country illegally and 17 had overstayed their visas. Kerwin Wilson, the TSA's general manager for general aviation, said the TSA is taking steps to address the matter. "We do have a plan in place. We're working very closely with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in terms of automating the process to ensure that TSA is also checking for immigration status as well as the Terrorist Screening database," he said. Rep. Chip Cravaak, R-Minnesota, said the government needs a "common-sense solution" to prevent another 9/11-style attack, but said no solution would be perfect. "We will never have 100 percent security. That just won't happen. Somebody that is perfectly normal one day can flip, because of whatever pressures he or she is under," he said.
those are just some of the words Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel has been called by her peers and the global press days before the German election. So how did a quiet, unassuming fraulein from a small, rural town in the former communist-ruled German Democratic Republic (GDR) become arguably the most powerful female politician of all time? While the constant chatter of fixing the Eurozone has recently abated, the Christian Democratic Union leader was a popular choice for another term with strong approval ratings thanks to securing the country's lowest unemployment rate in two decades. Upon completion of her recently won third term as chancellor, by 2016 she will become the longest-serving elected female head of government in history. The original "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher, who served Britain for 11 years as prime minister, currently holds this record. Merkel's rise from political obscurity to the highest publicly elected office in Germany is a captivating tale. Born in West Germany, her father Horst Kasner, a Lutheran pastor moved the family in 1957 to the small town of Templin in East Germany shortly before the erection of the Berlin Wall. Humble beginnings Growing up under communist rule in East Germany would have had a strong impact on the future chancellor. While she has often said she was never interested in the politics of the new state, her world view was shaped by her surroundings. The restrictions and ever-present secret police -- the Stasi -- taught Merkel the importance of discretion and when to speak up. Through her childhood, Merkel was strong academically and teachers praised her skills in math and language, but it was the sciences that caught her attention. In turn, she went on to study physics at the University of Leipzig. The characteristics that come from being a scientist have become one of her defining skills as a politician. As Stefan Kornelius writes in Merkel's authorized biography, "Angela Merkel -- The Chancellor and Her World": "Merkel shapes her world view in an analytical way. She weighs up arguments, industriously collects facts, considers the pros and cons ... "She admires people with qualities that are not her own, but prefers to work her way steadily forward. Herein lies Merkel's problem: if her opponent doesn't use rational arguments, then the logical framework ceases to function, arguments cannot be weighted against each other and compromises cannot be reached." Deja vu? Upon leaving university and earning her PhD, Merkel initially worked as a quantum chemist at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin before joining the a small independent party, Democatic Awakening shortly before reunification between East and West Germany. She swiftly rose through the ranks of the party, which quickly aligned with then-chancellor of West Germany Helmut Kolhl. By the time the Berlin Wall fell in October of 1990, Merkel was working as deputy press secretary to the East German premier. In the following months, she watched diplomacy in action and the rapid financial collapse of East Germany after reunification. Put simply, this experience shaped her economic world view forever. "Look, I've experienced the collapse of a country, the GDR," she said in April at an event with the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk. "The economic system failed under the aegis of the Soviet Union. "What I really don't want is to look on, eyes open, as Europe as a whole slips back. I would find that absurd, we have all the skills in our hands." Unafraid to say 'nein' Viewed as the de facto leader of Europe, Merkel's legacy will largely be determined by the outcome of the euro crisis. Thrust into the center of Europe's ailing economic landscape, she has taken a hard line with neighboring countries and world leaders. "In the debt crisis, Merkel is seen as the hard-bitten, humorless, austerity-enforcing "Madame Non" who refuses to underwrite the rest of the euro area's debt," writes journalists Alan Crawford and Tony Czuczka in their recent book, Angela Merkel: A Chancellorship Forged in Crisis. Bringing her own brand of Germany's social market economy to the world stage with her divisive austerity measures, Merkel operates a step-by-step approach to her politics. As Crawford and Czuczka write: "... Merkel consults widely to better formulate her approach to policy making. She is not given to snap, intuitive decisions, but is rather very deliberate in the way she reaches her conclusions." But what also makes Merkel most unusual is how little her lifestyle has changed since assuming power. In contrast to fellow politicians, she lives a modest way of life residing in her Berlin apartment with her second husband Joachim Sauerspends. What's more, she doesn't put on lavish displays when hosting world leaders and she continues to spend weekends away from public glare at her home in the rural hamlet of Hohenwalde, east of Berlin. Though she is often described as "boring" and has been known to give long press conferences without revealing anything of news value, her understated political persona is her strength. In an age where pomp and performance can seem to trump policy and substance, Merkel is the exception to the rule. Her shrewd negotiation skills and ability to deliver make up for what she lacks in charm and charisma. After all, sometimes the ability for a leader to govern is more important than the ability to warm a crowd.
The latest string of fatal shark attacks in Western Australia is creating a climate of fear that could haphazardly undo a very important environmental law that protects great white sharks. Last weekend, 24-year-old surfer Ben Linden was attacked by a great white near Perth, becoming the fifth fatality off that coast in the past 10 months. In response, the Western Australia Fishing Minister, Norman Moore, promised to write the federal government "to know if there has been any update on the status of the white sharks and the sustainability level at which the Federal Government will lift protection." If Mr. Moore has his way, hundreds if not thousands of sharks will be killed in Australia. I have a problem with that. Yes, my heart goes out to the victims' families and friends who are mourning the losses of these tragic events, and I in no way downplay the pain and sadness an attack has on an entire community. Shark attacks: Is 'Jaws' back? I know, as I lost my leg and nearly my life after being attacked by a large tiger shark here in Hawaii. I do feel that these predators play a very important role in the health of our oceans, and I strongly oppose any type of shark hunting or culling program. Let me explain. By fishing for the great white shark, the bycatch will surely be a bunch of other shark species that have never had a history of munching on people. They did a shark culling program in Hawaii in the 1960s and early '70s, and 4,668 sharks were killed. Only 554 were the targeted species, the tiger shark. If a judge put one criminal along with eight innocent people on death row for a murder, would that be justice? And what if the guilty criminal was found guilty only because he belonged to the same race as the suspect in the crime? This type of rationale doesn't make sense, and it surely doesn't do anything to solve the crime. White sharks, by most scientific studies, have been shown not to be territorial. The shark that attacked Ben Linden is very probably hundreds of miles away, quite possibly in the waters of another country. The odds of a culling program capturing the same animal responsible for any one of the attacks is very slim. Sharks, the dominant predators in the sea, by nature need to be on the move to be efficient eaters. The element of surprise is their weapon of choice, and if they hang in the same area for too long the fish get spooked and they lose out on an easy meal. Moving ensures a more efficient way of consuming food. Great whites tracked off of Australia's northwestern coast have been known to travel to South Africa, and have been recorded traveling more than 12,000 miles in just nine months. China bans shark fin soup from banquets In Australia, the great white is protected by both domestic and international law, having been cited as "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1996. In 2002, with input from scientists, environmentalists, fisheries, and fishermen, Australia's government initiated the White Shark Recovery Plan. This law took a long time to be put into place, and undoing it would jeopardize the marine ecosystem. Any marine biologist will tell you that a healthy shark population equals a healthy marine ecosystem. Sharks predate dinosaurs, and millions of years of evolution have positioned them in a critical and vital role as an apex predator. Predator removal can cause a cascading effect that destabilizes the entire marine food web and, in turn, our oceans. Great whites are slow to mature and have very few offspring, so any type of culling program, even if done for a limited amount of time, would put their existence in peril. From what I have learned about Ben Linden, his entire life revolved around the ocean. So does mine. And so do those of millions of other people across the globe who surf, fish, swim, dive and feel more comfortable in water than on land. The ocean is a complex web of marine life, with many species being driven to extinction year after year. For humans and sharks to coexist is for us to respect their place on Earth.

He may be the King of Miami, but should LeBron James be treated like a head of state? That's the question some are asking after the basketball superstar was given a police escort Sunday night to the Jay Z and Justin Timberlake concert at Miami's Sun Life Stadium. The Miami Heat player, who was paid more than $19 million this year by the 2013 NBA champions, posted a video on Instagram. "Light police escort on the wrong side of the street," James is heard saying in the clip, "Headed to the big homie concert, JT. Holla." He also tweeted about it, writing "They treat us so well! Needed it cause traffic was nuts!!" Detective Alvaro Zabaleta of Miami-Dade Police described the incident in detail to CNN. "The stadium got a phone call that LeBron James was stuck in traffic, so the stadium personnel got hold of one of our police supervisors working the event," Zabaleta said. "He (asked) if there is any way we can get him out of traffic and get him to the concert." Zabaleta said an officer agreed to "take care of it." "It wasn't hard to spot LeBron," Zabaleta said, "and what the officer did was he told the officers working the traffic detail to stop traffic, hold the traffic and then he chose to go northbound on the southbound lanes. It took him less than a mile. He turned right and went onto the stadium property. "That's all the officer did, but LeBron went ahead and recorded it and said he was getting a police escort and going against traffic." The entire escort covered just eight blocks, Zabaleta told CNN. "From one intersection to another," was how he put it. But he also said department policy was violated. "We don't have our units ever go against traffic," he said. "The officer shouldn't have done that. But he didn't flagrantly say, 'I'm not going to worry about it'. He did stop traffic for eight blocks. And that was the end of it." Zabaleta said department supervisors "are looking into the incident, and they are assessing the whole situation. But he wasn't playing Frogger the whole way," referring to a video game in which a frog tries to make it across a road amid busy traffic. As for LeBron James, the detective only had praise. "We thank him," he said. "We thank him for providing us this footage because we were able to learn one of our officers was violating policy."
Fear is a terrible thing to waste. Yet modern Americans have squandered it as a tool for managing burgeoning populations of wildlife. A woman is in the hospital after she was mauled by a bear while walking in her central Florida neighborhood on Monday. Authorities caught a 75- to 100-pound yearling, but think the larger predator bear is still on the prowl. Tom Shupe thinks black bears have a people problem. He's a state wildlife biologist once responsible for dealing with growing bear-vs.-people conflicts in central Florida. I spent time with Shupe while researching the book "Nature Wars." He explained that perpetually hungry black bears need plenty of food habitat. Parents disown yearlings, forcing them to find new space. As their populations grow, they spread out, often from the Ocala National Forest south into the swampy sprawl of Greater Orlando. Trouble starts when a bear turns up in a backyard. Instead of scaring it away, too many people say: "Oh, isn't he cute. Let's toss him a cookie. Get the camera." Thus begins a photo collection of "Our Bear." But it's the beginning of the end for that bear, because the people are teaching it to associate the smell of people with food. The bear comes back for more. Soon it's breaking into the house. The people call 911: "Do something about your bear." Shupe arrives, darts the bear and moves it 100 miles. But the bear has learned people equals food, and does it again. After three strikes, the bear is shot -- euthanized. But it's not the bear's fault. It's the people's fault. Deer are eating our gardens and spreading ticks that cause Lyme disease; coyotes are killing our pets; turkeys are chasing our children to school; and geese have overrun our soccer fields because they don't fear us. And we have done all sorts of things to help them lose their natural fear. People say our conflicts with wild creatures are our fault because we encroached on their habitat. True, but only half the story. Many species encroached right back. Why? Because our habitat is better than theirs. Ours can sustain many more of them than their un-peopled landscape. We put out all sorts of food for them: lawns, gardens, shrubbery, birdseed, grill grease, garbage, dumpster waste. We offer water: Air-conditioner drip pans are water fountains for raccoons. Edges and hiding places are homes: A coyote can have a litter of pups in that brush behind your garbage and you won't know it. And we offer protection from predators, mainly ourselves. The results are mounting in people-vs.-wildlife conflicts. We should be celebrating a conservation success story that is unique on the planet. Instead, we demonize elegant creatures and fight over what to do, or not to do, about too much of a good thing. How did this happen? How did we turn this story into such a mess? In a nutshell: Over the last century and half, forests grew back on abandoned farmland; a century ago we ended commercial hunting and began restoring wild bird and animal populations. Since World War II we sprawled out into suburbs and exurbs -- something early conservationists didn't imagine. The 2000 census showed that for the first time, an absolute majority of the population lived neither in cities nor on working farms but in the vast sprawl zone in between. That's where family farms were a century ago. Today, it's full of trees and filling with wildlife. We've become forest people -- yet we spend 90% of our time indoors. There we get most of our nature on digital screens, where wild creatures are often portrayed as pets performing all sorts of antics. Research suggests that the white-tailed deer's biggest predator since the last Ice Age has been man. But sprawl man has largely gotten out of the predation business. He doesn't hunt and doesn't want others to hunt around him. He's peppered the landscape with hunting restrictions and enacted all sorts of laws against hunting, firearms discharges, even bow-and-arrow use in some places. What this means is that in just the last few decades, for the first time in 11,000 years, huge swaths of the whitetail's historic range -- the Eastern United States -- have been put off-limits to its biggest predators. No wonder deer have burgeoned out of control. In Massachusetts, for example, it's illegal to discharge a firearm within 150 feet of a hard-surfaced road or within 500 feet of an occupied dwelling without the occupants' written permission -- often not easy to get. Those two laws alone put almost two-thirds of the state effectively off-limits to hunting. Lots of states have similar restrictions and most were imposed in the name of safety. Guns kill 31,500 people annually in the United States, but hunters are relatively safe. Estimates say about 100 people die in hunting accidents, mainly in cases of mistaken identity. These days, deer kill more than twice that many, both in deer-vehicle crashes and when drivers swerve into a tree or an oncoming vehicle. These accidents hospitalize another 30,000 people. Don't swerve: Hit the deer. Overabundant white-tails, meanwhile, do enormous damage to the landscape, and not just gardens and shrubbery. They are ruining our forests by eating their understories so trees can't regenerate. No seedlings. No places for understory birds and the insects they feed their newborn. Black bears are shy and docile creatures motivated by hunger and fear, but they, like deer, beavers, turkeys, waterfowl and others, were almost wiped out in the United States by the end of the 19th century. Daniel and Rebecca Boone reportedly killed 155 of them in one season in Kentucky. With protection, they slowly came back in the 20th century, to about 750,000 in 2002 and perhaps a million or more today. Between 1900 and 2009, black bears killed 63 people -- 86% were in the last 40 years. Why the increase? More bears and more denatured people living in the same habitat. Birdseed sellers now refer to wild birds as "outdoor pets," helping to condition people to think that putting out food for wild animals is an act of kindness. It isn't. Food and no fear have turned many normally nocturnal wild creatures diurnal. They hang out among us in the daytime. Nuisance wildlife control people say tossing rocks at coyotes would help reinstill their fear of people. Instead, I've known people to toss them dog biscuits. Carrying a stick or a golf club is enough to deter wild turkeys, mail carriers tell me. Bear-proofing your garbage cans and taking down your birdfeeders in spring are no-brainers. Conflicts between people and wild animals will continue to rise as both populations grow into one another. There are all sorts of ways to mitigate them, both lethal and nonlethal. Some work better than others. Reinstilling their fear will help. Feeding them won't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Sterba.
who despite his very public defeat is still safe in his job as the House leader, say some key conservatives -- received a standing ovation Wednesday afternoon during that meeting of the entire House Republican conference. "I've actually been very proud of Speaker Boehner the last two-and-a-half weeks. I don't think that he should be ashamed of anything he has done," Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho told reporters. But Obama has doubted Boehner's ability to get things done, saying earlier, "he can't control his caucus." Still, Newt Gingrich, who held the position during the last government shutdown in the mid 1990s, put it this way: "It's actually the hardest job in the city." Boehner urges House GOP to support Senate deal The inside game Boehner has been challenged by the small but powerful right wing of the GOP caucus: the tea party conservatives. He was reluctantly pushed into adopting a tactic to link the debt ceiling and funding the government to defunding Obama's signature health care plan, known as Obamacare, even though he was against the idea himself. Ultimately, that tactic failed. But wrangling with the tea party isn't his only challenge. His members range from the rebellious Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who publicly rebuked Boehner by calling instead for a "bold" leader, to Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, a Republican who represents an urban, Democratic-leaning district. And they all have different agendas and different ideas of how to push back against a Democratic Senate and a Democratic President. Still, he needs their support -- he needs at least 217 of his 232 Republicans to pass a law -- because no Speaker wants to rely on members of the opposite party to pass legislation. That's the fastest way to lose power. But, this time, he had to do just that. The entire Democratic caucus in the House  -- 198 members, with two not voting -- voted "yes" on the bill to end the current crisis while 87 Republicans joined in to pass the law. And this isn't the first time he's had to rely on that formula. Republican shutdown pain may boost Dems in 2014 The heavy lift "Until you've tried it, you cannot imagine the energy level it takes to try to do what Boehner is doing," Gingrich said. But the latest quagmire over government spending and the debt limit once again display Boehner's challenge. Early on, many said Boehner would never get conservative members of the GOP to acquiesce on federal spending and the debt ceiling, and would need Democrats to get anything through. Even when the stakes were highest and public opinion polling against his efforts, Boehner still struggled. He straddled the GOP caucus and the President in negotiations, but ultimately fell short. As the tide was shifting and the Senate deal took shape earlier this week, Boehner made one last stab to get Republican demands attached to the bill. But he couldn't get consensus among the GOP and the effort collapsed late on Tuesday. "It's a very severe problem if he gets beaten ... and if he gets beaten publicly," Gingrich said. Instead of losing, Boehner simply didn't hold the vote. Cruz: Senate Republicans should have followed House Republicans He's lost before But this wasn't the first time Boehner came up short, struggling numerous times to find agreement. Last year, he was forced to pull a bill providing aid to Superstorm Sandy victims because he didn't have enough Republican support. And during the debt ceiling fight in 2011, spending cuts totaling $900 billion were not enough for some members of his caucus to agree to raise the debt ceiling. At the last moment he had to pull the bill and pull out of negotiations with the President. Obama blamed "the extreme faction in his caucus" for handcuffing Boehner. "So there are been repeated situations where we have agreement and then he goes back and it turns out that he can't control his caucus," Obama said. Boehner and Obama have not successfully completed a negotiation. Other leaders, including Vice President Joe Biden, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have had to carry critical negotiations over the finish line. And Republicans got very little out of this deal. Obamacare is still law and government spending was not reduced. Furthermore, public opinion is blaming the GOP. CNN Poll: Americans to blame GOP for shutdown Boehner the hero Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said this saga has been a "nightmare" for Boehner. But he said his speakership is not yet over. "He is shaken but not yet fallen," Ornstein said. "I think that Boehner has listened to the American people," Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots said. One conservative group, Club for Growth, said they don't worry much about Boehner. "We don't get a vote in who the Speaker of the House is," spokesperson Barney Keller said. 9 things we missed during the shutdown The organization works to elect conservative members. They are notorious for running primary challengers against Republican incumbents who don't prove their conservative cred. "If there are enough conservatives in the House, the direction of the House will take care of itself," Keller added. Until next time The deal to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling simply punts the same issues until early 2014. It's likely that a similar fight will happen again in a few months, once again pitting Boehner in the middle of his Republican caucus and Obama. In an interview on CNN's 'New Day," Senator Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, clearly said what a lot of people in Washington are thinking. "Obviously, I don't envy the position that Speaker Boehner has been in," she said. A deal for now, but this year's been a legislative dud for Obama
and even taste -- the grit floating in the air. The World Health Organization has set healthy level of Air Quality Index at 25 micrograms, while Beijing considers a 300 reading as "Bad" and 500 as "Hazardous." Last weekend, however, it breached 700! "I'm getting itchy," complained my daughter Michelle, 22, visiting us from New York. "I could feel it at the back of my throat." Longtime expatriate residents in the Chinese capital jokingly call it the "Beijing tickle," a nagging cough that takes a long time to shrug off. Beijing adopts emergency measures for hazardous pollution Air pollution is a major problem in China because of the country's rapid pace of industrialization, reliance on coal power, explosive growth in car ownership and the sometimes disregard for environmental laws. It is now paying the price of rapid development. In 2007, China overtook the United States as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. It is also the No. 1 source of carbon emission worldwide, state-run China Daily reported recently. Added to this, the World Bank says 20 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in China. Health is the big casualty. Almost 400,000 premature deaths are recorded in China each year, with the majority related to pollution, according to the World Bank's "Cost of Pollution in China," a report based on official Chinese figures. A growing number of individuals and institutions are looking to find last-gasp solutions. The government has already shut down high-polluting factories, built new subway lines, and allocated state subsidies to reduce the cost of public transport. Beijing bans vehicles from the road one day a week to reduce heavy traffic and vehicle emissions. It also imports natural gas from other provinces to rely less on coal for heating and cooking. As part of a long-term solution, Chinese researchers are producing prototypes of solar and electric cars to replace gas-fueled vehicles. So far, these measures have not produced consistently blue skies and clean air. Green activists complain that even though government regulations have improved, laws are often ignored. One of Beijing's big problems has been the city's geography, as it is surrounded by mountains shaped like a horseshoe. When pollution blows in from the heavily industrial neighboring towns and cities, it builds up and, in windless days, gets trapped over the capital. Off-the-charts pollution in China In fact, this is not the first time bad air has bedeviled Beijing. I remember one day last year when the U.S. embassy's air monitoring system reported the pollution level as "crazy bad." What can we Beijing residents do about it? Wear face masks? Unless you use heavy-duty ones, I am told, they do not really make much difference. Turn on air-purifiers full blast? We've never used one at home, although my friends swear they help. "The truth is there isn't a lot people can do about ambient air pollution," said Deborah Soligsohn, an environment and energy specialist at the World Resources Institute, a U.S. based think tank. "Ambient air pollution is not nearly as large a health risk as more immediate forms of air pollution.  Tobacco is a much larger killer, and indoor air pollution from poorly ventilated wood and coal fires has traditionally been a much larger killer in the developing world. Smoky restaurants and bars can have levels as high as these recent air pollution numbers." I know a few expat friends who have decided to relocate out of Beijing and were mainly turned off by its bad air. "What did you think of Beijing?" I asked David Van Dyke, who lived and worked in Beijing for nearly seven years before relocating to Canada last year. "Mostly liked it, save for the Internet (censorship) and pollution," he said. Meantime, some residents have resorted to humor and sarcasm online to vent their frustration. "I love my city, but I refuse to be a human vacuum cleaner," netizens re-tweeted on Weibo, China's microblogging social media. "We want clean air, and we want to breathe freely." Others posted pictures wearing face masks of various shapes and designs. A page of Sohu.com featured a section covered with haze, with a note saying the headlines have been obscured by a massive smog.  "Click on it, and it will clear up." Once it cleared it, the title read: "We live in a "toxic gas.'" "Don't worry," Henry Ngo posted on my Facebook page. "Smokers are inhaling worst air than this. And they did not die immediately!" Is this now the new "normal"? Soligsohn, who lived in Beijing for 14 years, does not think so. "This is a confluence of bad events," she assured me. "Pollution is definitely a problem. It hasn't gone away, but there is no reason to believe an extreme reading is anything other than an extreme." There seems to be no quick solution. "This is complex and takes time, but the work has begun," Soligsohn added. "It took cities like London and Los Angeles almost half a century to get from really dirty air to pretty clean air, and LA has never actually fully met EPA standards, which have become tougher with new information." Five days after what some have dubbed Beijing's "air-mageddon," the sunshine has reappeared, and the air has actually turned relatively clear. My daughter points out that London and Los Angeles have confronted pollution as well. As long as the Chinese recognize it is a problem, they will eventually be able to strike a balance between a clean environment and a thriving economy." Wind has dispersed some of the smog, although my chest remains heavy and my throat is still itchy.
Several years ago, when my husband and I went to collect our newly adopted cat after surgery, the vet receptionist picked up the phone and languidly informed whoever was at the other end: "Minou's mommy and daddy are here to pick her up." Wow. Apparently I had a baby. A furry one, currently stapled together with a cone on its head. There are various types of pet owners. At one end of the spectrum is the "no nonsense" variety who believe the lines between beast and human are far too often blurred. At the other extreme are those whose pet is categorically their baby. And then there's everyone in between. For many, consciously or otherwise, a pet is a practice child, a step up in responsibility between none and a lot. Something to love and take care of, but that you can leave alone when you go out for dinner without fear that it will die. This is perhaps why so frequently the horse (dog, cat, or chinchilla) comes before the (baby) carriage. But what happens to your "pet baby" when it comes time for a real human child to join your family? Our baby is due in July, and despite my occasional fantasies that the cat won't notice, I know that in reality she will, and I don't think she will like it. The cat sleeps in our bed, commands attention whenever she desires, and doesn't have to share her living space with anything of a remotely similar size. Dr. Heather Thomson, from Manhattan's West Village Vet, says that more than 50% of the practice's clients who have a new baby find their pets are stressed, nervous and upset by it. No wonder. When a pet is used to being the baby, it can be disconcerting to suddenly have to compete with what appears to be a tiny, yelling object vying for the spotlight. "They were our kids," says Caroline Krediet of dogs Hector and Lemon prior to their baby's arrival. "We arranged weekend outings around them, indulged them. Put their needs first at all times, almost." The same was true for Lauren Crandall before her son came along. "It was all about E.G., all the time," she says of their rescue Havanese, "He was a first thought always." However you see your pet -- baby, miscellaneous family member, friend, possession, colleague, animated stuffed animal -- chances are that it thinks of itself as the creamy filling to your Oreo and won't enjoy being usurped by a screaming upstart. "The dynamic changes," Thomson explains, "and the pet realizes it's no longer the center of the universe." No matter how you slice it, babies -- especially newborns -- demand a huge amount of time, attention and energy, often leaving a deficit for your furry friend. "I think E.G. was depressed for a while," says Crandall, "The first four months were the hardest. He wasn't getting out as much as he used to and wasn't getting the same amount of attention during the day. I felt really badly for him." Problems adapting to your bundle of joy can range in pets from mild to severe. "A cat can withdraw, stop eating, develop a medical problem, deviate from normal cat habits -- urinate or defecate outside of box, become destructive, anorexic, aggressive," says cat therapist Carole Wilbourn, adding that a very anxious cat could even attack the baby or other family members. Thomson says dogs can also become more aggressive, often in a misguided attempt to protect the baby. Our cat is fairly neurotic -- a kind of cat version of, perhaps, Woody Allen -- and is not a huge fan of any kind of change, no matter how minute. Thus our goal has been to arm ourselves with as much information as possible on smoothing the transition at home from pet palace to nursery. We hope this will help us avoid a kitty mental breakdown. There's a lot of advice out there for pet owners with similar concerns. Thomson says bringing a used baby blanket home from the hospital prior to the baby's arrival can help your pet become accustomed to the scent. She says some pet owners have also used plug-in pheromone diffusers, which can help to calm animals during the period of transition. Wilbourn suggests a multifaceted approach with cats, including a lot of feeding, petting, name-crooning and general attention around the time that cat and baby meet. She also recommends desensitizing the (poor) cat by playing a recording of a baby crying, and perhaps having a friend's child come over to play so the cat gets used to kids, and presumably is then less prone to a full blown freakout when sticky hands grab its tail. She details more approaches in her book, "The Complete Guide to Understanding and Caring for Your Cat." Krediet said when they bought their daughter home from the hospital, they let the dogs sniff her feet and get to know her, making sure never to leave them with her unsupervised. Crandall, meanwhile, sums up their approach as "NDLB" (no dog left behind). "We call him our firstborn son and he is the baby's brother," she says, "We try really hard to make him feel special and not that he has been sidelined." But in case you were wondering if the upshot of all of this is a Disneyesque house of harmony where pet and baby frolic and snuggle in happy unison, you may be asking too much. While mini-Crandall is becoming increasingly fascinated by the furry creature sharing his home, Crandall says dog E.G. -- while tolerant -- does not return the interest level. "He sniffs him and then goes about his business." Lack of interest, however, is still one of the better outcomes. Some pets never come around to the change in circumstances. Wilbourn says it can be a good idea to arrange a "worst-case scenario," alternative home for your pet, in case all else fails. But there are some happy endings. Wilbourn describes one cat who, after an initial show of aggressive behavior, became devoted to the new baby and now acts as a kind of "cat nanny," standing guard over its little friend, maybe wearing a pinafore (that part possibly is just in my imagination). And according to Krediet, Hector and Lemon's affections have increased exponentially along with the baby's propensity to drop food on the floor. Hector now even lets her ride on his back. "I think they adapted to the situation the same way we adapted our lives, going from crazy, freedom-loving 20s into responsible married 30s," she says, "I think they've enjoyed parenthood, too."

Rescuers hoping to find two hikers missing on the frigid slopes of Oregon's Mount Hood faced worsening weather conditions Monday night as forecasters predicted white-out conditions that could severely hinder search efforts. "Starting tonight and through tomorrow, it's going to be windy, and white-out conditions are going to be highly likely," said Scott Weishaar of the National Weather Service. Up to 2 feet of snow is expected to fall Monday night into Tuesday at the elevation where rescuers are searching for any signs of Anthony Vietti, 24, and Katie Nolan, 29, who have been missing since early Friday. A third hiker who was with them, 26-year-old Luke Gullberg, was found dead Saturday. A state deputy medical examiner said Monday that the cause was hypothermia, CNN affiliate KGW reported. Rescue crews took advantage of a brief break in the weather Monday afternoon to search previously unreachable higher elevations of the mountain. "Unfortunately, we did not detect anything out of the ordinary as far as gear or people," searcher Monte Smith told reporters. "With increasing snowfall coming down, it's going to make everything that much harder." Weishaar said another series of storms Wednesday will dump another 10 inches to 18 inches of snow in the area, with temperatures in the low- to mid-20s. Snow was expected to start falling at 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET). "We only have today. We know we only have today," said Vietti's aunt, Teri Preiss. Rescuers said they were putting no time limit on their efforts, and would do all they could despite the grim forecast. "This remains a search and rescue mission," Clackamas County Detective Jim Strovink told an afternoon news conference. "We have two experienced climbers who were well-equipped. We have an obligation to continue on and that's what we're going to do. We owe that to the family and we owe that to the climbers." Search crews will meet Tuesday morning to assess weather conditions and determine how to proceed, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office said after ending search efforts for the day Monday. Ground efforts have been severely hampered by avalanche conditions, which kept rescuers from accessing the parts of the mountain they wanted to reach early Monday morning. The avalanche threat also thwarted ground searches Sunday, authorities said. Searchers were also examining high-resolution photographs taken by aerial surveillance teams, hoping to find any sign of life. Capt. Chris Bernard of the U.S. Air Force 304th Rescue Squadron said infrared devices are being used as well. If the hikers have gone into a snow cave and have an air vent, the devices could pick up a heat signature, he said. When the three hikers set out at about 1 a.m. Friday (4 a.m. ET), they were planning a fairly easy, "semi-technical" hike in which they would come down the south side of the mountain, said Deputy Scott Meyers of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. Preiss said pictures show "it was a perfect climbing day, absolutely clear." The three hikers sent out a message in advance saying that conditions were "absolutely perfect" and that they would be back by late afternoon, she said. "These kids loved, loved climbing. All three of them. They climbed together often. They climbed hard mountains together before. And they did it successfully and well. And they were careful climbers," Preiss said. Dr. Christopher Young with the state medical examiner's office said Gullberg had suffered minor injuries -- cuts, scrapes and bruises -- apparently caused by a fall, KGW reported. Investigators believe the 26-year-old was able to move himself after falling an unknown distance. "Accidents can happen -- and it happened here," Preiss said, describing Gullberg as a "passionate young man" who was very well-prepared for all his hikes. David Vahey, a family friend of the Viettis, said, "We know that they, all three, loved hiking  and they all three loved Jesus. And we just want to ask for prayer." The three hikers are from the Pacific Northwest. Vietti's home is Longview, Washington; Nolan's is Portland, Oregon. Gullberg was from Des Moines, Washington. Gullberg's MySpace page is filled with photos of him hiking in various places. A friend wrote Saturday on the page, "I love you dude and miss you." His grandmother, Marjorie Gullberg, said she will miss his smile. "He was just like my son. He did everything for me," CNN affiliate KPTV quoted her saying. Dennis Simons, a chaplain for the fire and police departments in the city of Sandy, Oregon, spent time with the families of all three on Sunday. "They're grieving and hoping. There are thousands of people around the world praying that Katie and Anthony will be found alive," he told reporters, holding back tears. The mountain rises 11,239 feet above sea level, with a vast base that stretches over 92 miles (148 km). It is the highest mountain in  Oregon. Mount Hood is a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes, according to the Web site mthood.info. Gullberg's death is the latest of many accidents on Mount Hood, KPTV reported. The worst occurred in May 1986 when nine people, including seven students from Oregon Episcopal School, died after they dug a snow cave during a sudden storm.
Stomach for the fight, matched by a stomach for waffles and hash browns. Bubba Watson, the American golfer who has just become a multiple golf winner, showed he had the appetite for both as he secured his second Masters win, adding another green jacket to the one he won in 2012. As he walked down the 18th fairway, Watson was able to soak up the atmosphere and prepare for a celebratory trip to the Waffle House. A far cry from his nerve-shredding playoff win over Louis Oosthuizen at Augusta National two years ago. "I wanted to start celebrating but my caddie was in my ear saying, 'Not yet, not yet. Wait until we putt out and then celebrate all you want,'" the 35-year-old told CNN before a winner's dinner of waffles and hash browns. "It's a different feeling when you know you can four-putt the last hole and still win, it only took me two. It's a lot better feeling, the stomach feels a lot better this way than it did in the playoff!" Watson finished eight-under par for the tournament after a three-under final round of 69 saw him stretch three strokes clear of compatriot Jordan Spieth and Sweden's Jonas Blixt, the Masters debutantes who tied for second place. "I see myself as a guy who loves the game of golf and tries to get better at it," beamed the new world No. 4. The bedrock of Watson's success is his thumping drive, his ability to hammer the ball over 350 yards perfectly suited to the Augusta course. When Watson won the first major of his 11-year pro career in 2012, it coincided with him and his wife adopting a baby boy, Caleb. His son was one of the first people to embrace Watson on the 18th green. "That was a big deal," said Watson. "For us, being adopted parents, our story, trying to explain to him how much we love him and we care for him. "If he loves golf it's going to be great for him because he'll see that he was at Augusta. For him growing up, it will be great for our family to be able to explain all of this to him." If Watson's latest triumph is proof that he is no one-hit wonder, he showed no sign of getting carried away by his success. "I see myself as a blessed man who gets to play on the PGA Tour, gets to play at Augusta National in the Masters. "I see myself as a golfer, just an average guy who loves to play the game of golf and try to get better at it." Interactive: Explore Augusta National
The worst of a brutal winter storm may be over for many, but plenty of residents of the Great Plains and Kansas City still were coping Tuesday with its effects. Ice and falling branches downed power lines, cutting electricity to tens of thousands of people. And the heavy, wet snow made getting around difficult, whether by car or by foot. A CNN crew driving through Kansas City saw very few other drivers, and those who were out were taking their time. Residents, hit by back-to-back snow storms, just want a break. "It's been a long, what, seven days, 10 days, something like that," Kansas City resident and snow shoveler Lindsey Hughes said. "I'm ready to go home." The storm is weakening as it moves to the Northeast and the moisture is being stolen by the rain, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. "This is great news," Myers said. "The rain is taking the moisture out of the storm and taking the punch out of what could be the snow part of the storm, and it's raining out rather than snowing out." That means areas hit with snow Tuesday won't see accumulations like portions of Texas, northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas got Monday. Rain was falling Tuesday afternoon over much of the Midwest. There likely will be snow all day in Chicago, Myers said. More than 330 flights at O'Hare International Airport and 170 at Midway International Airport were canceled Tuesday. The storm is far from done. About 45 million people in 21 states were under some form of winter weather watch, warning or advisory. "This storm is still a very active and dangerous storm, from Michigan into western New York and the mountains in New England are getting hit with very heavy snows, said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service. The cold air associated with the system will linger on the East Coast through the weekend, he said. But to the west, piling snow damaged buildings Tuesday in Kansas and Missouri. In Shawnee, Kansas, the roof of a horse arena collapsed under the weight of snow Tuesday morning, CNN affiliate KSHB reported. It was one of several such collapses in the region because of the wet heavy snow, the station said. No injuries were reported in those collapses, but a person died Monday in a roof collapse in hard-hit Woodward, Oklahoma, said Mayor Roscoe Hill. Two other deaths came in Kansas on Monday in separate weather-related accidents on Interstate 70. One accident happened in Sherman County and the other in Ellis County, the Kansas National Guard said. More than 56,000 customers in Kansas and Missouri were without power Tuesday afternoon, the Kansas National Guard said. The bulk of the outages -- 45,000 -- were in the Kansas City region straddling the border between Kansas and Missouri. Most flights out of Kansas City International Airport were canceled. Roads were still snow-covered, but improving, in northwestern Missouri, the state Department of Transportation said on Twitter. The agency continued to discourage travel. Forecasters expected the storm to bring up to a foot of snow to parts of eastern Kansas, Missouri and Illinois a day after plastering southern Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Winter storm watches and warnings or weather advisories stretched from Oklahoma to Michigan. About 6 inches of snow fell in Mediapolis in southeastern Iowa, CNN iReporter Rose Schmidgall said. The high school student spent much of the day shoveling snow. "The digging was difficult and took a little while. The snow was packed really good and was heavy to scoop," she said, adding her family still had power as of Tuesday afternoon. Track the storm While the back-to-back snowstorms were frustrating for some, others put a positive spin on the experience. Jim Service of Overland Park, Kansas, spaced out the work of clearing last week's snowfall over four days. He finished Sunday, just in time for this storm. After a warm-up session clearing Tuesday's snow -- much wetter and heavier than last week's -- he retreated inside with a Clive Cussler novel and planned to enjoy the day off. Like many others, Service's company called off work Tuesday at the behest of state officials who warned that the storm was too dangerous for people to be on the roads. "It's great for me," he said. The Kansas National Guard warned that continued snowfall and gusty winds would make travel tricky through Wednesday. In Woodward, emergency vehicles were still having trouble getting around Tuesday, a day after the storm dropped more than 15 inches of snow. Crews dispatched to a house fire Monday had trouble reaching the home because of 4-foot snowdrifts. The snowplow sent to free the firefighters also got stuck. Even Tuesday, emergency vehicles still were having a tough time getting around. "We're in such a mess," said Hill, the mayor. Whiteout conditions The storm follows one last week that paralyzed a broad swath of the Plains and Midwest with more than a foot of snow. Portions of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and other states were affected. The storm prompted a state of emergency declaration in Kansas and parts of Oklahoma, bringing whiteout conditions to southern parts of those states and Texas. Schools in Wichita, Kansas, were closed Tuesday for a fourth straight day after last week's storm, which dumped a record 14.2 inches on the city. Wichita has received 21 inches of snow in February, breaking a record that had stood for 100 years, the National Weather Service said. And it all fell in the past six days. Are you there?

It started as a dot -- a bright, white star that raced across the Southwest. Over Texas, the dot became a streak that thickened, then spawned smaller streaks -- "little sparklies," Linda Steed recalled. Then came the sound -- "a big, rolling boom," she said. "The dog started barking like crazy." A decade ago, 200,000 feet above Steed's driveway in Nacogdoches, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart on re-entry. All seven astronauts aboard died. Friday, NASA marks the anniversary with tributes to the crew of Columbia and 10 other astronauts lost in the space agency's two previous fatal accidents -- the 1986 explosion that destroyed Columbia's sister ship Challenger, and the launch pad fire that killed Apollo 1's three-man crew in 1967. All three anniversaries fall within a week -- the Apollo fire on January 27, Challenger on January 28 and Columbia on February 1. Controllers lost contact with Columbia at 8:59 a.m. ET, about 15 minutes before it had been expected to land at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shuttle commander Rick Husband's wife Evelyn, who was waiting for him there, feared the worst. Space fan remembers the shuttle 10 years later "I remember looking up at the sky and thinking, 'Is that it? Is that the end of Rick's life?' " she told CNN. In an instant, she was a single mother with two young children. She was angry, frustrated. But she said NASA is "the best of the best." "They're human. They're flawed," said Husband-Thompson, who remarried five years ago. "They did the best they possibly could. Nobody maliciously caused this to happen." Nevertheless, she said, the grief still lingers. "The Lord definitely healed our hearts tremendously, but it's a lifelong process," she said. "I don't think that pain ever completely goes away." Commemorations will also be held in some of the towns where the orbiter's wreckage rained down that bright Saturday morning. One of them is Hemphill, Texas, about 170 miles north of Houston, where a roadside monument and a museum commemorate the disaster and the volunteers who combed the surrounding woods for pieces of the spacecraft. Space shuttle Columbia part found in east Texas "Some of them, you knew instantly what they were," said Belinda Gay, one of those searchers. "We would find some of the instrument panel that was in the shuttle cockpit. You could still see the numbers and the switches. You knew that if you found a can of caviar with Velcro on the back of it, you know it's not supposed to be in the woods." The remains of the shuttle's crew were found near Hemphill, along with the nose, part of the landing gear and much of the cabin. In addition, two members of a helicopter crew engaged in the search were killed in a crash the following month. Gay now leads the Sabine County Columbia Memorial Committee. Unlike Steed, whose space buff sister-in-law called her outside that morning, she was getting ready for a relative's baby shower and didn't see the breakup. "My house started vibrating, and the pictures on the wall started shaking, and then I heard two sonic booms," she said. "We knew something was up." Gay's husband was president of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter, and she led the group's Ladies' Auxiliary. Hemphill's VFW hall was quickly turned into a dining hall for the search teams, and it will host lunch for the guests at Friday's ceremony. Overall, NASA recovered about 84,000 pieces of the orbiter, about 40% of the craft, scattered from the Texas panhandle to Fort Polk, Louisiana. Pieces turned up as late as 2011, when the state's brutal drought uncovered an aluminum fuel tank on the bottom of Lake Nacogdoches. An investigation determined Columbia was doomed almost from the instant its 16-day mission began. A piece of insulating foam from its external fuel tank broke away, striking and cracking a panel on the orbiter's left wing. The damaged panel allowed searing hot gases to seep into the wing on re-entry, causing the craft to lose control and disintegrate. The three surviving shuttles returned to space starting in 2005. The last mission was in 2011, thirty years after Columbia -- the first of the class -- made its maiden voyage. NASA and the families of the crew decided to preserve its wreckage, which now sits on the 16th floor of the massive Vehicle Assembly Building at Cape Canaveral. For scientists, it's a "treasure trove" that lets them study the material used in the spacecraft, said Mike Ciannilli, the caretaker of the orbiter's remains. And for young NASA workers, it's a place to see firsthand why failure can't be an option. "When you actually walk amongst Columbia and you talk about the accident and you talk about the lessons learned and how you can do the best job you can do to help prevent this from ever happening again, that's very powerful," Ciannilli said.

Investigators in Colorado say they have broken up a massive methamphetamine ring in the Denver area that distributed pounds of the dangerous drug every week and laundered the profits using collectible comic books. Aaron Castro and his brother were the leaders of the methamphetamine ring, authorities say. "To launder the money you have to use something that is quick and convenient," Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said at a news conference Monday. "And in this case, they used classic comic books." While arresting the alleged ringleaders, brothers Aaron and Alfonzo Castro, law enforcement officers seized about 100 boxes of first-edition collectible comic books. Investigators say one title alone is worth $3,500 and the total collection of comics is worth half a million dollars. "It appeared they were working on a startup company for high-end comic books," said Don Quick, the district attorney in Adams County near Denver. Quick said the seized comic books included some first-edition Superman and Batman titles. The fragile, vintage comics were stored in plastic bags for protection. According to a grand jury indictment released Monday, the Castro brothers arranged for weekly, multiple-pound shipments of the meth from Phoenix, Arizona. The brothers then distributed the drugs to a network of runners that made deliveries to dealers around the Denver area. Suthers says Castro brothers sometimes used females "as drug mules by having them hide methamphetamine inside their vaginal cavities." These women would then deliver the meth to a series of houses, and then lower-level dealers would distribute the drug. "It's a tawdry piece of information, but it's a big part of what this group was doing," he said. These same runners also collected money from dealers and delivered it to the Castro brothers. Suthers said the drugs most likely were manufactured in Mexico, and each month's shipments had a street value of about $2 million. The indictment details 145 drug possession and distribution charges from October 2008 to earlier this month. The Castros and 39 other people are listed as defendants. The Castro brothers and their top runners are also charged with racketeering. Of the 41 defendants, 40 are in custody. The Castros are being held in the Adams County jail on $1 million bail each. It is unclear if they have attorneys.
After learning that Ashton Kutcher had landed in the hospital trying to follow Steve Jobs' all-fruit diet, CNN reader Sumday had just one question: "All I really wanted to know was why this diet was bad?" Jobs first fell for extreme diets during his freshman year of college, according to Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs." Jobs and his college friend Daniel Kottke became vegetarians after reading "Diet for a Small Planet." Then Jobs read "Mucusless Diet Healing System" by Arnold Ehret; Ehret believed in eating nothing but fruits and starchless vegetables like spinach, carrots and cucumbers. Jobs began with two-day fruit fasts, eventually going for a week or more. "I got into it in my typical nutso way," Jobs told Isaacson. Ehret's fruitarian diet, also called the Eden Garden Diet or Ehretism, is often used as a type of cleanse, according to LiveStrong.com. Designed to detoxify the system, it can do more long-term harm than good. When you only eat fruit, you're excluding a lot of valuable nutrients from your diet, says Marisa Moore, registered dietician and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "Protein is one of the main ones that comes to mind," she says. "(Without protein) you lose body weight. Protein acts like a building block for your muscles and skin and organs." The same goes for fats, Moore says. Although they often get demonized, fats play an important role in our hormone levels and brain function. Kutcher told reporters at the Sundance Film Festival that he ended up in the hospital with pancreas levels that were "completely out of whack." Steve Jobs movie premieres to mixed reviews Fruit contains a lot of natural sugar, which needs to be controlled by insulin in the body, Moore says. It's the pancreas' job to release that insulin; Kutcher's pancreas may have been overworked if his body was receiving an overload of sugar. Many readers wondered if an all-fruit diet could have led to Jobs' pancreatic cancer, which led to his death in October 2011. Scientists don't know what causes pancreatic cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Certain inherited DNA mutations might play a role, as well as chemicals in our environment or diet. Even if you don't overwork your pancreas, you're probably not eating enough calories on an all-fruit diet, Moore says. That puts the body into starvation mode, which can result in serious medical conditions like osteoporosis, severe dehydration and even heart failure, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. Here's the bottom line: Fruit is natural. It's nutritious. The government recommends eating 1 to 2 cups of it a day. Just don't go all "nutso" on it.
A tap water ban affecting hundreds of thousands of people in Ohio was lifted Monday after tests in affected neighborhoods returned "nondetectable" levels of a algae-related toxin, Toledo Mayor D. Michael Collins said. "Our water is safe," Collins said. "The families can return to normal life." Residents and businesses that did not use their water at all -- not even for showering or washing hands, both of which were allowed under the ban -- will need to run their water first to help flush their systems, Collins said, but "if you've been using water all along, just go on with life." Collins said the city would provide details later Monday about flushing systems. Residents of Ohio's fourth-largest city were told to avoid using their tap water all weekend after the state and federal Environmental Protection Agency showed high toxin levels in the East Toledo and Point Place neighborhoods, Collins said earlier Monday. Instead of isolating the two neighborhoods, Collins kept the ban on drinking or using tap water in the entire city until additional retests were completed. He declined to provide specifics on the names of neighborhoods in question and how high the toxin levels were. As many as 400,000 people were told not to consume, cook with or boil the tap water after a toxin called microcystin was found Friday in the water supply. Toledo's drinking water comes from Lake Erie, where a harmful algae bloom that causes microcystin has been growing. The city set up distribution centers for potable water, where members of the Ohio National Guard, fire officials and other first responders were giving out safe water. About 350 Ohio National Guardsmen were activated by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, according to a U.S. Defense Department official, adding that they set up three reverse osmosis water purification unit sites at two high schools and a police facility. The guardsmen also delivered ready-to-eat meals, the official said. Lining up for water About two-thirds of the Toledo area was affected by the water warning. Kasich issued a state of emergency for Fulton, Lucas and Wood counties. The potential contamination also affected four municipalities in Michigan, CNN affiliate WXYZ-TV in Detroit reported. There were no reports of anyone getting sick from the water, officials said. When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, algae can reproduce rapidly, forming a dense population known as a "bloom," according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Testing was crucial because NOAA says it can't determine just from images whether blooms are toxic. Ingestion of the toxin can affect the liver and cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and acute liver failure, according to NOAA. But the Ohio Emergency Management Agency said it was safe for adults to shower and for everyone to wash their hands. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, David Shortell, Ryan Sloane, Barbara Starr, Marisa Marcellino, Donovan Long and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.
Seoul, South Korea (CNN)It started with a first-class aviation executive throwing a fit on a flight over her nuts. It ended Thursday with that former executive sentenced to jail for one year. Heather Cho was working for Korean Air on December 5 when, as a first-class passenger on an international flight, an attendant served her macadamia nuts in a bag. Cho wanted them on a plate and demanded that the plane go back to the gate at New York's JFK airport so a crew member could be kicked off the flight. A South Korean judge said that her actions threatened the development of the aviation industry and inconvenienced passengers, and ruled that she violated aviation law, changed a flight path and interfered with operations. Cho had the chief steward removed from the flight after the plane had left the gate. The flight arrived 11 minutes behind schedule. A year in jail may seem just as extreme as freaking out over nuts. But the flight attendant testified that she was pressured by another Korean Air manager to keep quiet about Cho's behavior. Prosecutors said during her trial that there was a systematic attempt to cover up the incident. The judge blasted Cho for her conduct, saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger, she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight. The case, dubbed "nut rage," gripped South Korea, especially because Cho is the Korean Air chairman's daughter. There is growing resentment over the perceived privileges and nepotism for the families that control the country's top companies. Cho resigned as vice president at the company a few days after the incident and publicly apologized, saying she accepted "full responsibility." On Thursday, she appeared in court wearing a green prison uniform. She gazed downward. Her hair hung in her face. "I don't know how to find forgiveness," she said. Park Chang-jin, the chief steward who was booted from the flight, has said the former executive treated crew members like "feudal slaves." Details of Cho's behavior on the flight have emerged. Park and Kim Do Hee, the flight attendant who served the nuts, had knelt in front of Cho in apology. Kim testified that Cho berated them about the service, and later shoved and cursed her. When the flight arrived in Korea, the flight attendant said another airline manager, Yeo Woon-jin, pressured her not to talk to investigators about Cho's physically abusing her and Park. Yeo was found guilty of interfering with an investigation. Following public fury over the December incident, Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho apologized to the flight attendants and the public. Asked in court in January if he knew that his daughter mistreated employees, he said, "I just heard that she's strict with her workers." CNN's KJ Kwon contributed to this report.
With the holy month of Ramadan approaching, lawyers for four Guantanamo Bay captives are trying to end forced-feeding at the U.S. detention facility in Cuba. Shaker Aamer, Ahmed Belbacha, Nabil Hadjarab and Abu Wa'el Dhiab seek a speedy hearing to have their complaint heard because Ramadan begins on the evening of July 8. The timing is urgent because Muslims who observe Ramadan fast daily from dawn to sunset. The lawyers for the four filed the federal lawsuit in Washington on Sunday. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler set a deadline of noon ET Wednesday for the government to respond. Navy Capt. Robert Durand of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo said it would be "inappropriate to comment on that current litigation at this time." Gitmo hunger strikers: 'What more can they do to me?' Addressing the religious requirements of Muslims during Ramadan, he said, "we essentially invert our schedule to accommodate these religious practices, including involuntary feeding." The lawsuit says Aamer is a Saudi national and British citizen cleared by the Obama administration for release in 2009. Belbacha and Hadjarab, who are Algerian citizens, were first cleared for release in 2007 during the Bush administration and reauthorized for release by the Obama administration in 2009, the suit says. Dhiab is a Syrian national cleared for release in 2009, the lawsuit says. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, repeated its call Monday for the force-feeding of hunger-striking prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to stop. Daily life at Gitmo: Hunger strikes, sprays of filth Ibrahim Hooper, the national director of communications at the council, said the practice of forced-feeding is always wrong and is particularly offensive during Ramadan. "We've asked for the forced-feeding to be stopped in any case. ... It sends a very negative message to the Muslim world." Because of security measures in place, it's difficult to determine how many detainees are on hunger strikes. As of Tuesday, 166 detainees were at Guantanamo. Durand said 106 of them are being tracked as hunger strikers. Of those, 45 are being fed through tubes directly to the stomach or intestinal tract, he said. The number could be higher: The Joint Task Force does not comment on the 15 "high-value detainees" being held in a separate camp at Guantanamo. Some of them could be on hunger strikes, as well. More on the captives at Guantanamo Bay CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.
From supermarkets to the office supply store, it's hard to miss those tiny bottles of 5-hour Energy. The makers of 5-Hour Energy call it a "no-nonsense drink." "It would be easier for me to tell you where we didn't sell them in the U.S. than list all the places we do," said Carl Sperber, spokesman for Living Essentials, the Detroit, Michigan-based manufacturer of 5-hour Energy shot. The small, shot-glass size bottles promise to provide energy and alertness without jitters to fatigued Americans. Unlike other popular energy drinks that market to college students, 5-Hour Energy's audience is multitasking, working professionals. The market demand has skyrocketed since the product hit store shelves in 2004. The company expects to move more than 350 million shots this year, Sperber said, up from 174 million in 2008. "This is a no-nonsense drink," Sperber said. "It is not a fashion statement. It doesn't have a cool name; it is just a simple grab-and-go product to help busy adults when they can't afford a letdown." Each 2-ounce bottle contains zero grams of sugar, 4 calories and about the same amount of caffeine as a small coffee. It also contains about a dozen ingredients that are broken down into B vitamins (B3, B6, B9, B12) and what the manufacturer lists as an "energy blend." But don't expect superhuman results, one expert said. "The B vitamins are given at extraordinarily high levels, and people need to know they are not some magic potion that's going to immediately raise your energy level," said Dr. Brent Bauer, Mayo Clinic director of complementary and integrative medicine. "There is no data that show that." The overall health impact of the shots' energy blend is a little fuzzy, according to some experts, because little data has been collected about the effectiveness or safety of the natural compounds. The blend contains: citicoline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, taurine, malic acid, glucuronolactone and caffeine. Phenylalanine, taurine, tyrosine are all amino acids our bodies naturally produce. Malic acid is a natural chemical substance found in food. Glucuronolactone is a byproduct of glucose produced in the liver. Citicoline is a natural compound that produces a chemical in the brain. "These energy shots have over a dozen ingredients all together, and consumers are ingesting them at very high doses but there is no research of how the ingredients react all together," Bauer said. "It's plausible if you put these 12 things together you will get a good result but it's also possible for them to cause major interactions to medications, or have a negative impact on the liver or kidney. We just don't know at this point."  Watch Dr. Gupta talk about the the safety of 5-hour Energy » Consumers of 5-hour Energy probably won't ever drink enough shots to reach toxic levels of the B vitamins, experts said, but side effects can occur. The maker notes on its Web site the potential "niacin flush reaction" from vitamin B3. It would be noticeable but temporary, one expert said. "If you have too much B3 it can cause tingling in your whole body. You will turn red, flush, but it would only last for about 30 minutes," said Jim White, spokesman for the American Dietetic Association. "Research also shows high doses of vitamin B6 can cause nerve spasm, also temporary trouble with muscle coordination." 5-hour Energy's spokesman says that his company doesn't have safety data on the specific blend of ingredients in its product, but believes that side effects are "rare." "None of our ingredients are synthetic drugs," Sperber said. 5-hour Energy also advises consumers to check with their health care provider before taking the booster. Medical experts acknowledged that if taken modestly, the products are unlikely to have a negative impact on health. "In moderation, it can give you energy. But the problem is people drink coffee, then take these energy shots, then down Red Bull, take Hydroxycut, and it is just too much in the body at one time," White said. The makers of 5-hour Energy agree. "There is no law against stupidity and there is always that person out there that is going to push the envelope and consume too many of them or combine our product with others, but we can't really control that," Sperber said.
a very good opportunity -- for Hong Kong to have one man, one vote -- universal suffrage. This is something we should all feel proud of." But that's not how Hong Kong's pro-democracy Occupy Central movement sees it. The group has vocally pushed for elections in which any candidate can run for chief executive. For weeks, protesters have taken to the streets. In a statement on its website, the group slammed Beijing's decision as a move that stifles democracy and blocks people with different political views from running for office. "Genuine universal suffrage includes both the rights to elect and to be elected," the statement said. "The decision of the NPC Standing Committee has deprived people with different political views of the right to run for election and be elected by imposing unreasonable restrictions, thereby perpetuating 'handpicked politics.'" Scores of people -- including pro-Beijing groups and pro-democracy supporters -- gathered at the city's AsiaWorld-Expo Monday where the city's decision-makers were meeting. Local media reported chaotic scenes at the conference center as pan-democrats attempted to disrupt an address by Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the NPC Standing Committee. Freedoms eroded Under the "one country, two systems" policy, the 7 million residents of Hong Kong -- defined as a "Special Administrative Region" of China -- are afforded greater civil liberties than those in the mainland. This reflects an agreement reached between China and the United Kingdom before the handover, which promised Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after its return. But the decision to change the way Hong Kong picks its leader comes amid increasing fears that those freedoms are being eroded. Currently, Hong Kong's leader is chosen by an election committee selected mostly by Beijing loyalists. Beijing brushed aside demonstrators' demands for a fully open election in 2017, saying the decision to change the system is in line with Hong Kong's basic law. Protesters demands are self-serving, one top official said. "Those people's so-called international standards are tailored for themselves," said Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee. "They are not the international standards, but their personal standards." Civil disobedience Throngs of pro-democracy protesters rallied in central Hong Kong on Sunday to condemn Beijing's decision and promised there would be more protests. The threat of civil disobedience "is our bargaining power," Benny Tai, the organizer of Occupy Central, told CNN earlier this month. "They take us seriously, though they will never admit that." After a massive rally calling for democracy in the Chinese territory in July, hundreds of demonstrators -- including prominent lawmakers -- were arrested. Tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting Occupy Central marched in Hong Kong earlier this month. Local media swirled with reports of marchers getting paid or bused in to attend the pro-government march. The march's organizer said he took the accusations seriously and would investigate but maintained that no laws were broken. 'Paper tiger' But a commentary published Monday by the state-controlled Global Times dismissed this opposition and suggested Hong Kong's political reforms had come to a "foregone conclusion." "The radical opposition camp is doomed to be a paper tiger in front of Hong Kong's mainstream public opinion and the firm resolution of the central government," it said. "These radicals could indeed incite a group of  people to rally with them but they are facing a powerful will and a strong legal framework that Hong Kong must remain stable. They will definitely be called to account if they resort to illegal confrontation. And if they raise objections in a legal way, their efforts will end in vain." Meanwhile, Fernando Chui Sai-on has been re-elected uncontested as Macau's chief executive. Like nearby Hong Kong, Macau is a "Special Administrative Region" of China, following its transition from Portuguese control in 1999. The territory has itself faced calls for greater democracy, though its constitution makes no mention of universal suffrage. A recent unofficial poll on this question was shut down by police and several pro-democracy organizers were arrested for allegedly breaching privacy laws.
Lifestyle guru Martha Stewart hopes to return to the United Kingdom as soon as a reported travel ban stemming from her criminal history is "resolved," the chairman of the company she founded said Friday. Martha Stewart has not been to the United Kingdom since her 2004 conviction, according to British media. "Martha loves England; the country and English culture are near and dear to her heart," Charles Koppelman, chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, said in a written statement. "She has engagements with English companies and business leaders and hopes this can be resolved so that she will be able to visit soon," Koppelman said. The statement was released after British newspapers, led by the Telegraph, reported that she had been refused a visa to enter Great Britain because of her criminal convictions four years ago. Stewart was scheduled to meet at the Royal Academy with several figures in the fashion and leisure industry, the Telegraph reported. The newspaper attributed the rejection of her visa to a blanket policy banning people with criminal convictions. A representative of the British Borders Agency would not comment on Stewart, saying only that "we continue to oppose the entry to the UK of individuals where we believe their presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good or where they have been found guilty of serious criminal offenses abroad." Stewart was convicted on four counts of obstructing justice in 2004 for lying to investigators about her sale of ImClone Systems Inc. stock at the end of 2001. She served five months in prison.
An Arizona judge declared a mistrial in the penalty phase of the Jodi Arias trial Thursday after a deadlocked jury said it couldn't decide whether to sentence her to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend. That means a new jury will be chosen, but the first-degree murder conviction still stands. A retrial for the penalty phase will begin on July 18, Judge Sherry Stephens said. A status conference has been scheduled for June 20. Since Tuesday, jurors had been deliberating whether Arias, 32, should get a death sentence for murdering ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in 2008. A source with knowledge of the jury's vote said there was an 8-4 split in favor of sentencing Arias to death. Jurors refused to talk to the media and immediately left the courtroom. The hung jury brought to a close a dramatic chapter in a high-profile case that has lasted for months, drawing spectators who lined up for courtroom seats and waited anxiously outside the courthouse. But the closely watched trial isn't over yet. In many states, the death penalty would be off the table if the jury couldn't agree. Not Arizona. "It's a very unusual circumstance, but it is part of Arizona statute that yes, if you get to this third phase, the penalty phase, and there is a hung jury, it means another jury comes in," said CNN's Ashleigh Banfield, who has covered the Arias trial from the outset. In a written statement, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said prosecutors "will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase." "We appreciate the jury's work in the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial and now we will assess, based upon available information, what the next steps will be," he said. Legal experts debate what's next Speculation surged that prosecutors might consider offering Arias a plea deal rather than going through the lengthy steps necessary to find new jurors and present evidence to them. "I don't think by any means that this is a sure thing you retry the penalty phase," said Mark Geragos, a criminal defense attorney. A lot depends, he said, on exactly how many jurors were willing to go with the death penalty this time around. "If it was 11 to 1 ... for death, you can be sure the prosecutor is going to want a retrial. If it tilted the other way ... they may just decide, 'No, we're not going to do that, we'll try and cut a deal,' " he said. Another key step for prosecutors will be speaking with Alexander's family to decide whether to proceed, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said. "The prosecutors have to speak to the family, because we know this family has been in the courtroom day in and day out. They were visibly shaken and upset when this hung jury came back," she said. "And so there's no question in my mind that it's premature to say this will, indeed, go to another penalty phase." CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said that prosecutors have little motivation to agree to a plea deal that offers Arias a life sentence. If the prosecution won in a retrial, he said, Arias would receive the death penalty. But even if they lost, she would probably get "the same life sentence she would obtain in a negotiated deal," he said. "The only real roadblock to a penalty retrial would be the strong request of the victim's family to accept to a plea and end the process now," he said. "I think such a request unlikely." Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury's inability to agree on a sentence was announced. Arias appeared to be on the verge of tears. One of Alexander's sisters sobbed. Even the normally stoic judge's voice cracked as she dismissed jurors. "Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the participants in this trial, I wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community," she told them. "This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities." An alternate juror and a juror who was on the panel cried as the verdict was being read. As the jury filed out of the courtroom, one juror said, "I'm sorry" to Alexander's family. Jurors struggle to agree Jurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they wouldn't be able to agree on a verdict. Earlier this month, the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that Arias was "exceptionally cruel" when she stabbed Travis Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. They pronounced her guilty of first-degree murder on May 8 after 15 hours of deliberations. For Arias to be sentenced to death, a jury's decision must be unanimous. About an hour into its deliberations on Thursday, the jury sent out a question, but the details of its query were not revealed in court. On Wednesday morning, the jury sent out a note saying its members couldn't agree. Stephens told them to try again and ordered them back into the jury room. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state of Arizona. Haven't been following the trial? Read this A plea for mercy On Tuesday, Arias pleaded with jurors to spare her. She told them she would dedicate her time in prison to performing acts of charity from behind bars. She said she would teach people to read or to speak Spanish, start a book club and donate her hair so it could be used to make wigs for sick children. She showed jurors several pieces of her artwork. She called Alexander's murder "the worst mistake" she had ever made, "the worst thing I've ever done." She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime, Arias told the jury. "But I know that I was," she said. "And for that I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer." A case packed with twists and turns Arias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex. Arias became his girlfriend two months later, she testified. They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women. In June 2008, Alexander missed two appointments, prompting friends to go to his house. They found his naked body crammed in a stand-up shower He had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head. His throat was slit. After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped. Relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable. The trial, which started in January, has been rife with sex, lies and digital images -- among them graphic autopsy photos that showed Alexander's body. Now, if the trial continues, some of the same gruesome details of his slaying may be presented again in court. "Because in order for a jury to actually impose the death penalty, they really need to see the cruelty," criminal defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant told HLN. "And they really need to understand the motives behind this murder and what great lengths she went to -- to actually cover this up."

McLaughlin, HLN's Anna Rhett Miller, Mike Galanos and Graham Winch and In Session's Grace Wong contributed to this report.
The euro club has suffered major shockwaves but its newest member has emerged as a shining economic light. Estonia, which joined the euro in January 2011, has shaken off its painful Soviet Union history and a credit-fed boom and bust to rebuild itself as an economy with shrinking unemployment numbers and growth far exceeding its peers. The fortunes of the small Baltic country, perched on the edge of northern Europe, run in stark contrast to the eurozone's troubled south, where unemployment has soared to record levels and recessions are becoming entrenched. But Estonia's finance minister, Jurgen Ligi, told CNN Greece -- the eurozone's most troubled nation -- was "paradise" compared to what his country had suffered after the USSR fell. Estonia, vice-chair of last week's Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation Ministerial Council Meeting in Paris, joined the euro seven months after Greece had taken its first bailout and as the common currency slid into crisis. Ligi told CNN joining the euro was a "natural choice" for a "small open economy." The country, which has just 1.3 million people, had always been "very much dependent on the eurozone, and now we are participating and influencing the decisions," he said. WATCH MORE: Post-Soviet winners and losers Accession to the eurozone, despite its problems, ensured the country offered a more stable currency, which gave confidence to investors, Ligi said, as well as showing "solidarity and political cooperation. "Sometimes you have obligations that you don't like but [do them] for general stability." Ligi said the austerity drive being pushed through Europe barely justified the label. "I would not use the word austerity in Europe, where the size of the social system is half of that of the world and consumption level among the highest." Estonia went through its own harsh program of cuts in 2009, slicing back state salaries and freezing pensions, after its real estate bubble went bust. The program helped ensure Estonia stayed inside the rules of entry to the eurozone. The country's growth rate averaged 8% between 2003 and 2007, before crashing into recession in 2008: its GDP shrank 14.3% in 2009 but has since rebounded. According to Ligi, real GDP will recover to pre-crisis levels next year. Ligi said the contraction was based on a "credit, real estate and consumption bubble" while today's economy "is on a much stronger basis." Estonia's debt to GDP ratio remains markedly lower than that of its European peers, sitting at 10.1% compared to Greece at a heady 156.9% and Italy at a painful 127%. WATCH MORE: Doing business in Estonia Estonia's export economy is also supported by its strong links with Scandinavian countries, including Finland and Sweden. Its unemployment, at 10%, remains high but lower than the eurozone as whole, which now sits at 12.2%. The OECD has predicted this will rise to 12.3% in 2014. Estonia's youth unemployment sits at 23%, again lower than the eurozone's 24.4%. The former Soviet nation has built itself into a free market, highly educated country with a strong telecommunications industry. The birthplace of Skype become known as E-Stonia following the USSR's collapse in 1991. It drove through an ambitious program of connectivity credited to Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the bow-tie wearing former ambassador to the United States who is now the country's president. Ligi said the country did not forget the crisis which followed its independence, when inflation reached 1000% and it underwent rapid monetary reform. "We have been making right and sustainable decisions," Ligi said. "There are lots of countries with similar history and situation than Estonia are not taking advantage. He added: "This is no miracle that Estonia is developing quicker than the others." Estonians bore with structural changes with the culture of practicality, Ligi said. "[Estonians] are very rational ...we have a lot of common sense," he said. "We appreciate solidarity but we do not forget personal responsibility." The country's leaders -- including Ilves -- have also proved feisty defenders of their economic reforms. In an infamous Twitter battle with Nobel economics prize winner and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who questioned whether Estonia's GDP recovery could be classed as an "economic triumph," Ilves slapped down the "smug, overbearing & patronizing" report.
in more ways than one. The show will remembered for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's (presumed) last hosting hurrah, a running gag featuring Margaret Cho as a North Korean representative and a couple of gasp-inducing Bill Cosby jokes. And as always, there were the usual bunch of what Ricky Gervais called "rich, beautiful over-privileged people," a few of whom, Gervais included, definitely seemed to be enjoying their drinks. But the Golden Globes also provided some stirring moments and hints of the awards season still to come: 1. Standing up for free speech and social justice As we've seen with the threats over "The Interview" and the Charlie Hebdo tragedy, there are still many who have no respect for diverse opinions -- or diversity, period. In a rousing address, Theo Kingma, head of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- the journalists' organization that puts on the Globes -- called out the need for free speech. "As international journalists, we understand the freedom of artistic expression. It is not only an integral part of the American fabric but a beacon that is reflected across the globe," he said. "Together we will stand united against anyone that will repress free speech. Anywhere, from North Korea to Paris." He received a standing ovation. Many stars wore "Je Suis Charlie" buttons in honor of the French magazine and its cartoonists who were slain by terrorists last week. The awards themselves showcased a diversity of subjects and performances. "Transparent," a show about a family finding new strength after realizing the father, played by Jeffrey Tambor, is transgender, won best comedy series. Tambor also won for best actor in a comedy series. "Glory," from the movie "Selma," won best original song. In his speech, Common highlighted the many faces of the movie. "I am the hopeful black woman who was denied the right to vote. I am the caring white supporter," he said. "I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand but instead was given a bullet. I am the two fallen police officers, murdered in the line of duty. 'Selma' has awakened my humanity. We look to the future, and we want to create a better world. Now is our time to change the world. Selma is now." 2. Women take center stageThough women still have to fight for worthy movie roles -- " 'Boyhood' proves that there are still roles for women over 40, as long as you're hired while you're still under 40," went one of Fey and Poehler's zingers -- the Globes showed that they're finding greater influence behind the scenes. "Transparent" was created by Jill Soloway. "The Affair," which won best TV drama series, was co-created by Sarah Treem. "Selma" was directed by Ava DuVernay. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, who won best actress in a TV miniseries or movie, was having none of the hand-wringing about women's roles. "What I think is new is the wealth of roles for actual women in television and in film. That's what I think is revolutionary, and evolutionary, and it's what's turning me on," she said. 3. Upsets! On the TV side, "The Affair" beat "Game of Thrones" and "House of Cards," among others, for best drama series, and the show's Ruth Wilson won best actress in a drama series. Gina Rodriguez of "Jane the Virgin" won best actress in a comedy series. "Fargo" took home TV movie/miniseries over "Olive Kitteridge" and "True Detective." But it's the movies that have awards-watchers wondering. "How to Train Your Dragon 2" won animated film over "Big Hero 6" and "The Lego Movie." Amy Adams won best actress in a musical or comedy for "Big Eyes." And the Globes may indicate a groundswell for Wes Anderson's "The Grand Budapest Hotel." It won best musical or comedy film over the favorite, "Birdman." Oh, and there was another kind of "upset." If you noticed some stars looking sweaty and uncomfortable, it may have been the apparently toasty climate inside the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton (although a hotel spokeswoman says the A/C was "fully operational"). Frances McDormand summed it up with her aggressive fanning. 4. "Boyhood" is the Oscars front-runner On the drama side, however, there was no drama: "Boyhood" won best picture, Richard Linklater won best director, and Patricia Arquette won best supporting actress. The three-hour film, shot piecemeal over the course of 12 years, has long been touted as the Oscar front-runner. It cemented that status Sunday night at the Globes. 5. Charming George Clooney You can always count on Clooney to add a touch of class and wit to any proceedings, and he didn't disappoint at the Globes, where he was given the Cecil B. DeMille Award. He was self-deprecating, joking about the bad reviews for his own "Monuments Men," and then prompted a million sighs when he paid heartfelt tribute to his new wife, Amal Alamuddin. Moreover, he didn't forget about his colleagues, working in praise for the late Lauren Bacall and Robin Williams, and went out with a comment about the Paris marches for Charlie Hebdo and free speech. "They marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear," he said. Clooney, as he often does, said it all. CNN's Lisa France contributed to this story.
Blasts of heavy machine-gun fire and explosions from airstrikes filled the air in Gaza early Sunday morning, hours after Israel rolled thousands of troops into the Palestinian territory. Israeli soldiers on the Israeli-Gaza border wait to enter Gaza on Saturday night. At least four Palestinians have been killed as a direct result of the ground assault, Palestinian medical sources said, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 460 since the conflict erupted December 27. The ground assault followed a weeklong campaign of airstrikes in what Israel says is an offensive to halt rocket attacks from Hamas militants in Gaza. "We want to create a situation where the civilian population in southern Israel is no longer on the receiving end of those deadly Hamas rockets," Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN. "We haven't articulated regime change as the goal of this operation. Our goal is to protect our people," Regev said. Israeli officials say four people have been killed and 59 wounded in Hamas rocket attacks in the past week. As night fell on the eighth day of the bloody conflict, both sides remained defiant, vowing to stand their ground and accusing the other of breaking a cease-fire that had been in place until last month.  Watch the conflict unfold on both sides » Not long after Israel's ground incursion began, Hamas vowed to "fight until the last breath" and warned Israel that "Gaza will be your cemetery." As the ground attack began, Hamas rockets continued to fly into southern Israel, with CNN reporters at the Israel-Gaza border seeing and hearing several of them. "We will not abandon the battlefield, and we will stay on the thorny course, and we will fight until the last breath," Hamas chief spokesman Ismail Radwan said in a statement on Palestinian network Al-Aqsa.  Watch statement from Hamas » The Israeli ground attack deepened a humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has been decried by international observers, including the United Nations. On Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, a spokesman said.  View reactions from world leaders » The spokesman said Ban "is convinced and alarmed that this escalation will inevitably increase the already heavy suffering of the affected civilian populations," according to a statement. Electricity, food and medical shortages already were a problem in the densely populated territory, concerns ramped up by the airstrikes. Taghreed El-Khodary, a New York Times writer in Gaza City, said that there was no electricity there Saturday and that she said she didn't know of any shelters set up by Hamas for residents.  Watch Times writer describe the humanitarian crisis in Gaza » Regev said Gaza's civilian population was not Israel's enemy. "In many ways, they are victims like us. Both the civilian population of southern Israel and the civilian population of the Gaza Strip have been victims of this terrible, extremist Hamas regime," Regev said.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour interview Regev » An Israeli airstrike hit a mosque in the northern Gaza village of Beit Lahiya on Saturday evening, killing 13 people and wounding 60, according to Palestinian medical sources.  Watch the chaos after the mosque attack » An Israeli attack earlier Saturday killed Azkariah al-Jamal, commander of Gaza City's rocket-launching squads, Palestinian and Israel Defense Forces sources said. Another airstrike killed two Hamas militants in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, Palestinian officials said. Israeli missiles hit 25 Hamas "outposts, training camps and rocket launching sites" Saturday morning, an IDF statement said.  Watch explosions in Gaza » The houses of two alleged Hamas terrorist operatives were also hit, the IDF said. One was the home of Azadin Hadad, described as the head of the Hamas military group in eastern Gaza City. The other, in Beit Lahiya, was used to store rocket-launching equipment and was the home of Ismail Renam, who "has a central role in the launching of Grad-type rockets against Israel," the IDF said. Meanwhile, Hamas militants launched 20 rockets from Gaza into Israel by late afternoon Saturday, IDF spokeswoman Maj. Avital Leibovich said. Rockets set a house on fire in Ashkelon, damaged a kibbutz dining hall and slightly wounded two people in an eight-story building in Ashdod, according to Israeli ambulance services. "We still see that Hamas is targeting Israeli civilians. Namely, we still did not reach the goal of crippling Hamas' launching capabilities," Leibovich said. CNN's Barbara Starr said top U.S. military leaders were aware in advance of Israel's plans to enter Gaza. The incursion began just hours after the European Union announced that a delegation is heading to the Middle East to meet with regional leaders and broker a cease-fire. A Middle East "Quartet" consisting of the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia is also trying to broker a truce. Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group that came into being in 1987, won by a landslide in parliamentary elections in Gaza in 2006. Months later, Hamas militants began attacking Israeli military posts and fighting with members of Fatah, the rival political party that controls other Palestinian territories. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared a state of emergency and dissolved the government in Gaza, although Hamas has had de facto control of the territory since then.
The assault began at dawn, as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan. Lt. Cason Shrode said that in less than two minutes, his team's generator was hit and they were out of power. The insurgency was so fierce, according to one soldier, that the troops couldn't get to their mortars to fire back. "They were under heavy enemy contact," Sgt. Jayson Souter said, describing the October 3 attack that pinned his comrades at Combat Outpost Keating, a remote base in Nuristan province. Four servicemen -- Souter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot, and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel. The United States says about 200 insurgents -- mostly local fighters, with some Taliban organizers and leaders -- had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains.  Watch more about their story » The battle started early on October 3 and lasted for 12 hours. At the end, eight American soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed and buildings at the outpost were destroyed. Fire support officer 1st Lt. Cason Shrode said the initial round "didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary." There was a lull and then there was a heavy attack. "We started receiving a heavy volley of fire. Probably 90 seconds into the fight they ended up hitting one of our generators so we lost all power," Shrode said in the interview posted online by the Defense Department. "At that point I knew that this was something bigger than normal." Troops called in air support. Helicopter gunner Chad Bardwell said he had to confirm the fighters he saw on ridgelines were the enemy because he had never seen such a large group of insurgents. "We tried to stop them as they were coming down the hill. ... We were taking fire pretty much the entire day," he said in the Defense Department interview. Chief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen, the Apache pilot, said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a "time-consuming endeavor" governed by tough terrain. He said the morning battle was "significant," but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons. "One of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain," he said in the same interview. Lewallen said the valley sits beneath mountains to the west and north. "There's a lot of cover so you really can't detect the enemy until they start moving again," he said, adding that it was tough for medical evacuation aircraft to land "because we were still trying to control" the outpost. The intense assault on Keating led to fires. There were five main buildings at the post and four of them burned. Soldiers eventually ended up going into one building. "The next morning it was pretty much ash besides that one building. I mean that's the way to describe it. Most of it had burned down. So we were pretty much at one building and the rest was just a shadow of what it used to be," Shrode said in the Defense Department interview. Lewallen said what came together was "air-ground integration." "All the training we've done before deploying here; it really clicked that day," he said in the interview. "We started realizing that the guys on the ground knew what they needed to tell us to get the job done. It made things that much easier." He disputed media reports suggesting that there weren't enough weapons and troops. He said 40 minutes into the fight, air power arrived. "We had everything we needed. It was just a big attack with a lot of people. Bad things happen -- but I think we did well, under the circumstances." Reflecting on the fight, Souter said, "Everybody basically came together and in the mix of it all, they were donating blood for the wounded that we had. They all pulled together to make sure that we can pull our boys out of this."
An elaborate kidnapping plot that targeted a Wake Forest, North Carolina, man ended with his dramatic rescue in Atlanta by an FBI hostage squad about midnight Wednesday, law enforcement said Thursday. Frank Arthur Janssen is receiving medical treatment but is safe after being held captive for five days by five people who face federal kidnapping charges, according to law enforcement officials who held a news conference in Wake Forest. The kidnappers sent demands to Janssen's family "for the benefit" of Kelvin Melton, an inmate at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, read an affidavit in support of a search warrant related to criminal complaints against the defendants. Melton is serving a life sentence without parole, said FBI North Carolina Special Agent John Strong. It was not immediately clear for what. Janssen's daughter, an assistant district attorney in Wake County, had prosecuted Melton, officials said. The affidavit details threats sent via text to Janssen's wife and daughters, a drama that underscores Strong's description of the kidnappers at the news conference. He called them "very dangerous people." On Monday at 1:51 a.m., Janssen's wife, Christie, began to receive text messages from a phone number with an Atlanta area code, the affidavit says. The messages said her husband had been kidnapped. One text said her husband was in the trunk of a car en route to California. Another threatened her, saying that if she contacted law enforcement, "we will send (Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take someone in your family to Italy and torture and kill them ... we will do a drive by and gun down anybody...and throw a grenade in your window." If the kidnappers' demands were not met, her husband would be hurt, the texts promised. The five facing charges are: Jenna Paulin Martin, Tiana Maynard, Clifton James Roberts and Jevante Price -- also known as "Flame" -- and Michael Montreal Gooden -- also known as "Hot" -- according to court documents. Don Connelly, law enforcement coordinator with the U.S. attorney's office, said pleas have not been entered. Authorities said that none of the defendants has retained counsel. Threatening texts to wife On April 5, a woman knocked on Janssen's door, and when he opened it, several people jumped him and used a Taser to subdue him, according to the affidavit. The attackers dragged him to their car and took off, crossing into Georgia, the document shows. Janssen's wife knew that her husband was going out for a bike ride Saturday, but when she came home that day after a shopping outing to find he'd not returned, she grew alarmed, according to a news release from Wake Forest. She saw what appeared to be drops of blood outside their house, it said, and called police. On April 9, Christie Janssen received another text from a different number that also had an Atlanta area code, the affidavit said. That message included a photo of her husband bound and seated in a chair. Another text came: "Tomorrow we will call you again an (sic) if you can not tell me where my things are at tomorrow i will start torchering (sic)" Frank Janssen. "If we find out the police seen this will kill both people now and go for you (sic) family," the text read, suggesting that another person had been abducted. One of the numbers connected to the kidnapping was identified as transmitting messages from Polk Correctional Institution, according to the affidavit, and the user of that particular number placed 99 calls to Melton's daughters. Melton's girlfriend told law enforcement that that number belonged to the inmate, the affidavit said. 'Get a bag, put it over his head' Law enforcement monitored calls between that number and another involved in the kidnapping, the affidavit detailed. According to the document, two male callers could be heard saying: "The first spot we are checking out is close to the house." "We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep." "Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth." "However you feel like doing it, just do it." "Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind." "Get some night time medication and make him go to sleep." "Make him drink the whole bottle of Nyquil." "Let's do it in the wee hours of the morning." "Make sure it is not a half-assed job. Get bleach and throw it on the walls. Maybe do it in the closet." After that conversation, authorities tried to enter Melton's prison cell to find the phone number used in the communications. Melton tried to bar the door and smashed the phone, the affidavit says. Later, at 10:40 p.m. April 9, law enforcement monitored a conversation between two callers who stated, "FBI helicopters are outside. We gotta get rid of holmes." A woman can be heard saying, "I'm not going anywhere, FBI are all over." While the search was on for Janssen in Atlanta, law enforcement traced one of the phone numbers to a residence in Austell, Georgia, belonging to Tiana Maynard. She was not there, but her children were, and law enforcement took them into protective custody, the affidavit said. Shortly after Janssen was rescued, Clifton Roberts drove a blue Chevy Tahoe with Maynard and Jenna Martin to a police station to get Maynard's children. Inside the Tahoe, law enforcement saw picks, shovels and a .45-caliber pistol, according to the affidavit. In connection with the search of Atlanta residences linked to the threatening text messages, officers questioned Price and Gooden, the affidavit details. Price "revealed his awareness of the kidnapping and acknowledged that he and Gooden were supposed to be the 'night watch' over the victim," the document states. Price led agents to the Forest Cove apartment complex in southeast Atlanta, where Janssen was rescued, according to officials. A father reunited with family, a shaken DA office Janssen has been reunited with his family, officials said Thursday. After he was freed, doctors evaluated him, Strong said, adding that he is receiving medical care. The FBI in Charlotte and Atlanta, the Wake Forest Police Department and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation are continuing to investigate the case, along with other law enforcement agencies in North Carolina and Georgia. Ned Mangum, district attorney for Wake County confirmed to CNN that Colleen Janssen works in his office. "This is different from anything we've ever had to my knowledge in the state of North Carolina," he said. "I've been in this court house for 16 years, and unfortunately, from time to time, there are threats made to courthouse officials. You rarely see threats against people's family and certainly rarely see something with this much precision." He said his staff is "incredibly professional" and handles serious cases, but "this one really affected us because it's one of our own," he said. "I've never seen our office as anxious as the past several days, and I'm so proud of them for not saying anything to compromise the investigation."
Central Texas, especially that sweet spot halfway between Dallas and Austin where small swaths of the legendary old prairies remain, is an earthly paradise. Blowsy live oaks spread their heavy limbs beneath cloud-spattered skies, while creeks and rivers—most prominently the meandering Brazos—ripple alongside gently rolling pastures gilded with waving grasses. These natural glories are precisely what led Laura and George W. Bush to choose the area for their Prairie Chapel Ranch, the retreat they completed in 2001, just after he became the 43rd president of the United States. Occupying some 1,600 acres near the flyspeck town of Crawford, about 25 miles west of Waco, the property is anchored by a strong but relatively modest home that quietly honors its location. During the eight years Mr. Bush was in office, the ranch served as the Western White House and welcomed numerous heads of state—from Russian president Vladimir Putin to Saudi king Abdullah bin Abdulaziz—some of whom were coaxed to join the leader of the free world as he raced along the property's 40-mile network of bike trails. And, of course, there are the well-known stories of the president spending his vacations clearing brush, often in searing heat, sometimes encouraging aides to join him. Architectural Digest: Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen's Custom Chateau These days the Bushes live in Dallas, also home to the George W. Bush Presidential Center, which opened last year on the campus of Southern Methodist University. But they regularly make the trip south to Crawford, where the former president is just as likely to be found handling a fishing rod or paintbrush as he is a chain saw. The ranch remains an essential getaway for the couple, a place to unwind and spend time with their daughters, Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager, as well as Jenna's family, and to entertain close friends like Deedie and Rusty Rose, prominent cultural leaders in Dallas. In fact, it was Deedie Rose who helped the Bushes find their architect, David Heymann, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Architecture. "Deedie and Rusty love the way David sites buildings," says Mrs. Bush, relaxing on a shady terrace that overlooks a shimmering lake where her husband often casts lines for bass. (The largest caught to date, the former president reports, was a ten-pounder.) "So when we bought this property, Deedie told me, 'I have your architect,' and, of course," she jokes, with a slightly arched eyebrow, "I always do what Deedie says." (Rose was a member of the committee that selected Robert A.M. Stern to design the Bush center.) Architectural Digest: Ralph Lauren Shows Off His Incredible Car Collection The former first lady notes that when she was growing up in Midland, Texas, her father built spec houses—"one story and low to the ground, a style you saw a lot in the '50s and '60s." She and Mr. Bush had a similar type of residence in mind for Crawford, mainly, she explains, "because we wanted the house to fit into the landscape." And she means fit literally. Heymann's design carefully nestled a single-level, three-bedroom limestone structure and an adjacent two-suite guesthouse into an almost imperceptible rise amid an existing grove of live oaks and cedar elms. Wrapped by deep roof overhangs—some up to ten feet wide—that serve to deflect the region's broiling sunlight and torrential downpours, the dwelling features tall windows that add a romantic transparency to its unpretentious countenance. "We wanted to see and enjoy the beauty as much as possible," says Mr. Bush. To answer the couple's desire for indoor-outdoor living, many of the windows are also doors that open to covered terraces and walks, buffalo-grass lawns, and the tree-shaded swimming pool. When the doors are flung wide, the home becomes a veritable pavilion, capturing passing breezes and filled with birdsong. The configuration also reduces the need for internal corridors—often the Bushes navigate the place by strolling out one door and in through another. "It's slightly motel-ish, but we love that," Mrs. Bush says lightheartedly. Architectural Digest: Bette Midler's Jaw-Dropping NYC Penthouse The former first lady worked closely on the project with Heymann, who found her to be a highly perceptive accomplice. "She has a lot of experience from seeing the carefully organized houses that her dad built, and she has a very, very good eye," he says. Early in the construction process Mrs. Bush pointed out that the masons' work on the Texas Lueders limestone that clads the exterior (and some interior) walls of the residence was absolutely perfect—and thoroughly wrong. The Bushes wanted to have a subtly rustic, handcrafted look, and Heymann had deliberately chosen to use the so-called rough-back pieces that were traditionally thrown away in the trimming process rather than smoothly finished blocks. "We had to take away their levels," the architect recalls, adding that the stone was relaid the old-fashioned, slightly irregular way, with taut string and appraising eyes. Architectural Digest: Radical Houses Around the World An advocate of sustainable design, Heymann incorporated into the compound a number of green features, including a geothermal energy system for heating and cooling. Rainwater runs off the house's standing-seam metal roof and into a gravel-filled moat, where it filters into a 42,000-gallon cistern concealed beneath the rear terrace and is recycled to irrigate the lawns.

A hard-line Iranian lawmaker has mockingly suggested that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad open up a nightclub, according to Iran's Fars News Agency. Lawmaker Ali Motaheri took the sarcastic poke at Ahmadinejad during a speech to parliament where he said the president's soft stance on Iran's Islamic dress code was to blame for an increase in young Iranian women wearing sexually provocative clothing, Fars News reported. Motaheri has long been a fierce critic of Ahmadinejad. "The state of the dress code today has created addictions in society, so Ahmadinejad should think about starting a nightclub or a cabaret," Fars News quoted Motaheri as saying. Iran's dress code requires women to cover their hair and bodies, but many push the envelope with tight clothes and head scarves that barely cover their hair. Often, the result is a cat-and-mouse game between young, defiant women who want to wear what they choose and Iran's morality police, who patrol the streets on foot and marked cars to enforce the code. Ahmadinejad's hard-line political opponents started attacking the president about his views on the dress code in 2010 after he criticized morality police for taking excessive measures against alleged offenders. Journalist Farbod Jamali contributed to this report.
The mystery winner of a New York lottery ticket worth $1 million has until Sunday to claim the prize, or the money will return to a pool for future winners, according to state lottery officials. The winning lottery ticket was purchased at the Playland Market in Rye on August 25, 2012. According to New York Gaming Commission rules, winners have up to one year to claim their prize. New York Lottery officials have been urging players to check their tickets for the winning numbers: 1-6-7-20-49, Powerball 23, and come forward before the ticket expires. "We're hopeful the lucky winner has already signed the ticket and is making plans to claim it before it's too late," said Gardner Gurney, acting director of the Division of the Lottery. The New York Gaming Commission uses all means possible to get the word out when it is presented with an unclaimed prize, including news media and social media, said Christy Calicchia, spokesperson for the commission. Sandy victims among the 'Ocean's 16' Powerball winners To claim the money, the winner must present the ticket at any one of New York's seven customer service centers during business hours. Since the one-year anniversary of the ticket's purchase falls on a Sunday, the winner would technically need to have presented the ticket by the close of business Friday, said Calicchia. It is unclear how the situation would be handled if the ticket were to be turned in on Monday, she said. Lottery winners may also turn in winning tickets by mail. As long as the ticket is postmarked by August 25, it will be deemed valid. The gaming commission will be monitoring incoming mail to see if the ticket turns up, Calicchia said. New York state has seen several prizes go unclaimed, the largest of which was drawn more than a decade ago. In 2002, the owner of a winning ticket sold in Brooklyn never came forward to collect the $68 million prize. It remains the highest jackpot to go unclaimed in New York Lottery history. The next year, a ticket in Brooklyn went unclaimed again, this time for a jackpot of $46 million. Winnings can go unclaimed for a variety of reasons, Calicchia said, noting sometimes tickets or lost or become unreadable after being left in a pocket and washed. She said many tickets are unclaimed because winners don't notice they scored with smaller, tiered prizes in lottery jackpots. "Most people don't realize that there is more than one prize in the lottery drawing," she said. Rye is in Westchester County and is about 30 miles north of New York City. The New York Gaming Commission regulates all aspects of gaming and gambling activity in New York state, including horse racing, charitable gaming and the state lottery.

Gambia plans to execute all death row prisoners by September, the president said this week, sparking condemnation from human rights groups worldwide. The tiny West African nation last executed an inmate about 30 years ago. It is unclear what prompted the change in stance. By the end of last year, Gambia had 44 people on death row, including two women, according to human rights activists. Death row convicts will be executed by mid-September, President Yahya Jammeh said in a speech on state media Sunday that was rebroadcast Monday. "All those guilty of serious crimes and are condemned will face the full force of the law," he said. "All punishments prescribed by law will be maintained in the country to ensure that criminals get what they deserve: that is, that those who kill are killed ... By the middle of next month, all the death sentences would have been carried out to the letter." The nation imposes capital punishment for various crimes, including murder and treason, the latter commonly used to stifle dissent in some African nations. Previously on CNN.com: Death row inmate leads authorities to hundreds of bone fragments In 2010, British human rights group Reprieve said Gambia had introduced the death penalty for those found with more than 250 grams of cocaine or heroin. It's unclear whether the law still stands. Amnesty International, the French government and other rights groups condemned the execution order. "President Jammeh's comments are deeply troubling and will undoubtedly cause severe anguish to those on death row and their families," said Audrey Gaughran, the Africa director for Amnesty. "Any attempt to carry out this threat would be both deeply shocking and a major setback for human rights in Gambia." International standards on fair trials are not followed in the country, according to Gaughran. "Death sentences are known to be used as a tool against the political opposition," she said. "The number of grossly unfair trials is shocking and an especially serious concern in cases where the death penalty is handed down." In 2009, Jammeh made a similar threat to resume executions, but did not act on it, Amnesty said. Nonetheless, the new threat raises concern in the nation, the group said. The former British colony is surrounded by Senegal and has a population of 1.3 million. Jammeh took power in a military coup in 1994, and was elected president two years later. The government represses political opposition groups, and the president has won all elections since he came to power. Most of the polls are tainted by allegations of fraud. Gambia's human rights record has drawn steady criticism since his election, but the president has won supporters by building new hospitals, schools and other infrastructure.

Indecisive foodies have another tool to help them find top-notch eating and drinking destinations. Google on Monday overhauled the Zagat.com website and released new, free Zagat mobile apps for Android and iOS. Until now, Zagat required people to login to access the reviews. With this overhaul, Google is making Zagat content free and accessible to everyone without having to sign up. Google purchased the restaurant-review company in 2011 and added its database of reviews to existing Google services like Google Maps and Google Plus in 2012. Zagat ratings score dining, hotel and other entertainment venues on a scale of one to 30. They haven't replaced Google's own Yelp-like scoring system, which assigns locations a one- to five-star rating based on user reviews in Google Plus. Those scores currently show up in Google.com search results. Zagat competes with other review databases such as Yelp and Foursquare. Unlike those crowd-sourced rankings, Zagat still relies on a slightly older, less-freewheeling model. It collects information about the places it rates using surveys and then tallies the results for the final scores. The new Zagat has four categories of content. There are listings for individual places that bear the familiar one-paragraph summary and ratings for food, decor, service and an average cost. There is also original content put together by local editors in the form of lists, blog posts (called "Buzz") and videos. The revamped Zagat site and apps only cover restaurants and nightlife in nine cities to start, but Google says it will add 50 locations in the coming months. It also plans to add in results for other types of destinations, including stores, hotels and places of interest. For now, anyone living in or visiting Austin, Boston, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco or Washington can use the tools to choose an adventure.
Toshiba said Tuesday it will no longer manufacture HD DVDs, effectively ending the long-running battle with the rival Blu-ray for a dominant high-definition format. People watch a demonstration of HD DVD at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Toshiba said it made the decision to cease developing, manufacturing, and marketing HD DVDs after "recent major changes in the market." It promised to continue offering support and service for all existing Toshiba HD DVD products. "We carefully assessed the long-term impact of continuing the so-called 'next-generation format war' and concluded that a swift decision will best help the market develop," Toshiba President and Chief Executive Atsutoshi Nishida said in a news release. Toshiba's HD DVD business has been suffering recently with a string of major retailers and rental companies announcing their preference for Blu-ray, developed by Sony.  Watch video on the battle of the formats » Last week alone, Wal-Mart and online rental company Netflix said they would abandon HD in favor of Blu-ray. Last month, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment -- which had been the largest media company releasing videos in both formats -- announced it would offer DVDs solely in Blu-ray. The DVD battle has been reminiscent of the VHS vs. Beta fight in the early 1980s. It has left many consumers confused and waiting to see which technology will emerge as the industry standard. Sony's Blu-ray is backed by Disney, 20th Century Fox, MGM, Dell, Panasonic, and Philips. Toshiba's HD DVD is backed by Paramount, Universal Pictures, Microsoft, Sanyo, and NEC. Toshiba said it would continue to work with those companies and study ways to collaborate with them in the future. Tens of billions of dollars have been at stake as major movie studios battled for a dominant format. But rival game consoles have been part of the struggle, too -- Sony's Playstation 3 plays Blu-ray discs, while the Microsoft Xbox will play HD DVDs if users install an add-on component. Both Blu-ray and HD are high-definition DVDs, the successor to ordinary DVDs which show pictures only in standard definition. But Blu-ray and HD involve different hardware and are not compatible with each other, meaning consumers have had to decide which system to invest in. Both formats have an excellent picture quality with a large storage space. But Toshiba has lost the battle because it lacks a retail presence in many markets, said Carl Gressum, a senior analyst at Ovum, a London technology consultancy. "They didn't manage to bring on board some of the China vendors, they didn't bring (on board) the retailers, they've failed to develop in the European and Asian markets," Gressum told CNN. Warner Brothers announced its decision to drop HD DVD right before last month's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a significant event for corporate buyers. Gressum said that led to an immediate drop in retail support for Toshiba's format. Gressum said manufacturers of both formats have made things more difficult for retailers by forcing consumers to make a choice between the gradually-dominant Blu-ray and the much-cheaper HD. "They're losing money in many cases because of the price war between the two formats as Toshiba -- and also Microsoft, to a certain extent -- has been playing the price card for HD DVD players," he said. Toshiba said the company would continue to market standard DVD players and recorders. E-mail to a friend
Yume-Hotaru's first novel was a best-seller in Japanese bookstores, and he wrote it entirely with his thumbs. Publishers in Japan were quick to see the potential of putting cellphone novels into print. The 22-year-old who would rather be identified by his pen name than his real one (Yume-Hotaru means "Dreaming Firefly" in Japanese) started composing the novel on his cell phone in 2007. Between classes, on the bus or before going to bed at night, he would type single sentences into his phone's tiny keypad, uploading each one straight to the mobile social networking site Mobage-town. The more Yume-Hotaru posted, the more popular his story became. It won a prize and soon publishers approached him, asking if he wanted to turn his digital book into a paper one. By early 2008, his novel "First Experience," a story about love and sex in high school, was a top title in one of Tokyo's biggest bookstores. Since it emerged in Japan nearly a decade ago, the cell phone novel, or keitai shosetsu, has moved from a little-known subgenre to a mainstream literary phenomenon. Keitai shosetsu sites boast billions of monthly users while publishers sell millions of copies of cellular stories taken from phones and turned into paperback. It is even spreading to other countries as other cultures start to take part in a type of composition long considered purely Japanese. As the name suggests, cell phone novels are written entirely on handsets and posted on sites like Maho no i-rando (Magic Island), the first and largest mobile novel portal in Japan. The site has a million titles, 3.5 billion monthly visitors and six million registered users, according to the company. Mobile readers instantly see new chapters as they are added, often adding comments about the direction they think a novel should take. The diary-like stories are written and read mostly by young women in their teens and 20's. Many authors use pen names and claim their stories are at least partially autobiographical. The novels often center on themes that are rarely discussed aloud in Japanese society -- drugs, sex, pregnancy, abortion, rape and disease. "When they write those novels, they share their secret, personal problems, and when they read by mobile phones, they can hide what they are reading," explained Toshie Takahashi, an associate professor of media studies at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. "They are also involved and engaged with their mobile phones very strongly," added Takahashi, noting that 96 percent of high school students own a cell phone in Japan. "The mobile phone itself is embedded in young people's everyday lives very deeply and also emotionally and physically." Despite its popularity among young women, a male writer known as Yoshi, widely considered the first cellular novelist, brought the burgeoning genre to light when he self-published "Deep Love" in 2002. The story about a prostitute in Tokyo sold nearly 3 million copies and was adapted for film, television and Manga, or Japanese comics. Publishing phenomenon A struggling Japanese publishing industry was quick to take notice of the growing popularity of keitai shosetsu, especially early works like Yoshi's "Deep Love." Many of the popular cell phone novels have since been turned into paperbacks, and bookstores across Japan now have entire sections devoted to the digital-age literary genre. By 2007, half of the country's 10 best-selling novels were written on cell phones, according to book distributor Tohan while last year mobile novels and comics were a $240 million market in Japan, which is over 5 percent of the country's $4.5 billion total mobile content market, according to Japan's Mobile Content Forum. In January 2009, three Japanese mobile phone novel publishers reported collective sales of 1.7 million copies. Publishers, like Goma Books, one of the first to print cell phone novels, have also launched their own keitai shosetsu sites, which they use to sift through for talent whose work will be marketable on bookshelves. Goma's mobile story site Orion carries 20,000 novels and has approximately two million monthly users, according to the company. Goma has also published several top-selling keitai shosetsu, including "The Red Thread," by Mei (also a pen name). Since it was released in 2007, the story, which revolves around the romance of two middle school students, has sold nearly 2 million copies and was adapted for a TV series and movie last December. The publishing house now prints a new mobile novel every month. Some literary purist don't think the cell phone novels constitute real literature, but their popularity is undeniable. "The sentences may be a bit immature. It doesn't have a major plot line sometimes. It is just love stories of ordinary high school girls, said Aya Tanaka, a spokesperson for Goma. "But it is kind of like popular comics, it is what the teenagers want to read, and for the publishers, it is quite a big market and it does sell." Michael Keferl, a trend consultant with Cscout Japan in Tokyo, believes that "[readers] are participating in the creation of the novel, which is one of the reasons why they buy it afterwards. They are helping to write it and are also witnessing it being written." Crossing cultures However some believe the future of keitai shosetsu as one that is quickly following in the footsteps of most teenage fads: A sudden and rapid rise to mass popularity followed by a slow but steady decline to the fringes of the not-so-cool. Last year few mobile novels appeared on best-seller lists while new stories published online have lost their characteristic edginess, said Chiaki Ishihara, a Japanese literature expert at Waseda University in Tokyo who has studied cell phone novels. "Keitai shosetsu is rapidly declining at this point," Ishihara told CNN. "In a few years, it may not even be considered a subculture." Others see the cell phone novel moving from an initial boom that peaked around 2007 to a period of market stabilization. "You are not going to have as many of the big hits as you had before because there are so many titles out," said Keferl. "Things are leveling out now." While the cell  phone novel market may be cooling in Japan, it is just starting to emerge in other countries, like the United States, where faster networks and cheaper data plans are leading more consumers to use handsets in ways similar to people in Japan. Many companies are starting to launch mobile web sites in the U.S., including DeNA, the Japanese firm that owns Mobage-town, the site where Yume-Hotaru writes his keitai shosetsu. "What has surprised us is users in America are behaving in a similar way to the Japanese," said Dai Watanabe, president of DeNA Global, Inc. "They are writing about things that are very close to their actual lives. I was surprised to see it is very similar with what is happening in Japan." Julian Knighten, a 22-year-old who works three jobs, writes his cell phone stories while lying in bed at night in his home outside of Dallas, Texas. He said he had never heard of keitai shosetsu before but likes writing cell phone novels because of the relationship he has with readers and the feedback they give him about his stories. "It encourages me to write," said Knighten. "And it gives me the chance to escape reality."
'Debswana' is already  Botswana's biggest  private employer. It is also expected that a growing number of companies will seek to set up shop in the country to have direct access to its rough gems. Yet, authorities are quick to point out that the country cannot rely solely on the precious stones, especially as diamond sales have been hard-hit in recent times amid the financial crisis. Read more: Botswana's heavy metal heads "That is obviously a worrying phenomenon," says says Ponatshego Kedikilwe, the country's minerals minister. "The dependence on diamonds only has been given us sleepless nights, whether it's in terms of revenue, foreign exchange or taxes and the budget." Mohohlo adds that the government is aware that diamonds are exhaustible and non-renewable. "Therefore we have to continue to ensure that the benefits deriving from them are there for everybody to see," she says. For now, though, Botswana's economic future is linked to the precious stones still buried in the soil. The diamonds allure is enduring as people still consume them faster than they are being mined. And a growing gap between supply and demand will, for now, keep prices high.
Oscar-nominated actor Bob Hoskins announced Wednesday he is retiring from acting following his diagnosis of Parkinson's disease last year. The 69-year-old British actor, perhaps best known for playing the detective in the 1988 film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," issued the statement through his wife, Linda. "He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career," it read. "Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time." Hoskins first gained fame in the 1978 British TV miniseries "Pennies from Heaven," according to IMDb.com. His other notable films include 1986's "Mona Lisa," which brought him an Academy Award best actor nomination, as well as "The Long Good Friday," "Mermaids," "Hook" and "Mrs. Henderson Presents." He has appeared in at least one production every year since 1972. He played the elf Muir in this year's "Snow White and the Huntsman." Parkinson's disease is the same neurological disorder that actor Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with in 1991. CNN's David Daniel contributed to this report.
Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd bid farewell to politics, telling parliamentarians Wednesday in an emotional speech that he will step down at the end of the week. Rudd was first elected prime minister in 2007. Party infighting caused him to lose the post to Julia Gillard in 2010. He reclaimed the position in June in yet more infighting in the Labor Party. But when it came to elections in September, the bookish incumbent lost to the pugnacious style of Tony Abbott. Labor infighting boosted Abbott's standing in the polls and -- under Gillard -- the party faced certain defeat at elections this year. While the installation of Rudd as prime minister for a second time helped the party claw back some of the ground Labor lost under Gillard, many analysts said his arrival came too late to save the party. "For our family, recent statements since the September election have been particularly hurtful," Rudd told lawmakers. "As parliamentarians you might say we become inured to all of this, although I doubt it." Abbot's office issued a statement saying "While Mr Rudd will no longer continue as a parliamentarian, I have every confidence that he will continue to serve our country and the values that he has always believed in." "Whatever disagreements my colleagues and I have had with Mr Rudd, we will always honour what he achieved on the day of the National Apology," the statement said. "Ancient wrongs were addressed that day. It was a great moment in our country's history and it happened because of him." In November 2009, Rudd -- then the prime minister -- formally apologized to thousands of adults who, as impoverished British children, were brought to Australia with the promise of a better life but found abuse and forced labor. The so-called Forgotten Australians -- children who came from British families struggling with severe poverty or from institutions in the UK -- were brought to Australia in a program that ended 40 years ago.
A landmark ruling which could change the way top-level European football matches are broadcast and sold by television companies was made on Tuesday. The European Court of Justice said that soccer fans have the right to watch sport franchises, such as the English Premier League, on a range of European broadcasters rather than solely via the rights holder designated for each national territory. The court said in a statement: "A system of licenses for the broadcasting of football matches which grants broadcasters territorial exclusivity on a member state basis and which prohibits television viewers from watching the broadcasts with a decoder card in other member states is contrary to EU law." Since its launch in 1992, the Premier League has sold exclusive match rights to a small number of television networks per national territory, a business model which has seen it become one of the richest in the world -- generating an estimated $5.3 billion in income, according to British newspaper The Guardian. Can football chants ever go too far? But the ruling -- in response to a long-running case by BSkyB against a British pub landlady who broadcast a Greek match feed -- now means that consumers could buy decoder boxes from satellite broadcasters from other nations, at a cheaper price, to watch the games they are interested in. BSkyB, which paid a combined $2.73 billion with ESPN to be the main rights owner for the Premier League in the United Kingdom, saw its share price drop 3% on news of the statement. "It will have implications for how rights are sold across Europe in future, which we are considering," a Sky spokesman told CNN. "As a broadcaster, it will remain our aim to secure high-quality content for our customers based on the rights available to us." The ruling's effect could be far reaching if the value of football rights were to be diminished. The large amount paid to the Premier League has seen record amounts of prize money given to top-flight English clubs such as Manchester United and Arsenal -- finance which has subsequently been used to build new stadia and attract some of the world's best players. "This could drive a coach and horses through Sky's business model for broadcasting of Premier League matches," according to Stuart Adams of intellectual property law specialist Rouse, based in London. "There is every prospect they will find fewer people willing to pay for licenses to broadcast Premier League matches if for a little effort they can get the same pictures via a cheaper overseas feed. When the deal is re-negotiated with the Premier League it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change. "And if they are markedly reduced, of course, that will have a direct impact on clubs' revenues and therefore their ability to buy and pay the salaries of top talent. That in turn could lead to yet more polarization between the haves and the have-nots of the English game." The English Premier League said it would release a statement shortly. Sanjay Nijran, a sports lawyer for Smithfield Partners based in London, told CNN it could affect future revenues for sport franchises across Europe. "Any broadcasting rights holder that intends to license rights will be bound by this ruling, it appears they will not be able to limit exclusivity to national borders and consequently the value of these rights could be limited. They may have to look for other models," Nijran said. "We're not sure but we would imagine the Premier League would possibly be considering a pan-European license to sell the same broadcasting rights to the continent." But it could mean that football fans in Europe are able to pay less to watch the matches they want. "Currently top-level football is sold to a host broadcaster in each European Member State, you have only one choice of provider through which to watch the match. Now, this ruling allows you to watch on the same terms as any other person across Europe," added Nijran, who is representing suppliers of satellite television decoders over the issue. "What this gives the consumer is choice because through increased competition they are able to choose cheaper providers." However, the ruling could have a detrimental affect on English lower-league football, Adams told CNN, as it would circumvent the ban on Saturday afternoon matches being broadcast live -- a regulation which is supposed to protect smaller clubs. "This would have a huge potential impact on clubs' pricing policies as they are likely to have to reduce prices at the turnstile in order to continue to attract crowds," Adams said. "While this is an issue for Premier League clubs, it is likely to be much more acute for lower-league clubs who are far more at risk of reduced attendances in these circumstances. Such clubs are also more reliant on revenue generated at the turnstiles. "If the net result of this is more football on the telly for fans to watch, and less money for clubs to lavish on the salaries of their top players, I think most of us would be overjoyed. But if we also see smaller clubs go out of business as a direct consequence, I'm not so sure that football fans will be cheering quite so loudly."
Barbara Walters' pick for the most fascinating person of 2014 is interestingly a celebrity who shuns such a spotlight. On Sunday night Walters named Amal Clooney as the top selection for her annual list. The former  Amal Alamuddin married Clooney, one of the world's most eligible bachelors, in September. Already an accomplished international human rights attorney, the new Mrs. Clooney was not well known by the general public prior to being linked to the award-winning actor. "I guess the question is: 'What does it take to fascinate one of the most fascinating men in the world?' " Walters said introducing Mrs. Clooney as the selection. "She is known primarily through her spouse. And while we now little about her, we know a great deal about him." Clooney had famously told Walters in a 1995  interview "I'm never going to get married again." The word spread so successfully, Clooney told Walters in 2006 that he no longer had to tell women he dated that he planned on staying single. "You did my work for me," he told her. Snagging the perennial bachelor is what grasped the "most fascinating" title for his wife. "Amazingly, Amal has been the subject of very little snark or envy," Walters said. "Maybe because we, like George Clooney, find it impossible to resist perfection. Or maybe it is because it is heartening to think that no matter how long it may take the perfect someone is out there for everyone." Taylor Swift, Michael Strahan, Chelsea Handler, Oprah Winfrey, Scarlett Johansson, Elon Musk, Neil Patrick Harris, George R.R. Martin and David Koch also made this year's list.
When Babatunde Osotimehin last year became the head of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) -- the international development agency promoting female rights -- the news didn't go down too well with many women working in the field. After his appointment Osotimehin was told that some female ambassadors at the U.N. were upset that a man had been made head of the agency. But he was determined to put their minds at ease. "We had lunch with them [female ambassadors] and they asked me, 'so, justify this position,'" remembers Osotimehin. "I spoke and after that they stood and said 'OK, we're satisfied with that, from today you are an honorary woman.' I carry that title well." Read: Too many mothers still dying A tireless advocate of female rights, Osotimehin has had a long career caring for women. He qualified as a doctor in 1972 and went on to teach at the University of Ibadan, in his native Nigeria, before heading Nigeria's National Agency for the Control of AIDS and becoming the country's health minister. Today, as executive director of the UNFPA, Osotimehin, who is also the U.N.'s under-secretary general, is focused on gender equality and reducing poverty, helping hundreds of millions in developing countries. Some 20 months into his new role, Osotimehin says he wants the agency to reach as many women and girls around the world as possible, improving their access to reproductive and educational services. "There are an estimate of 222 million women in the developing world who are in union, who want family planning and they are not getting it," he says, citing a shortage of funding and cultural obstacles among the reasons for the lack of universal access to reproductive services. According to a UNFPA report released last week, meeting the family planning needs of those 222 million women would have resulted in 26 million fewer abortions in the developing world this year. Osotimehin speaks passionately to world leaders about the agency's concerns and works closely with women around the world to make sure they have choices and know their rights. "I think it's a job that actually was made for me and I say that with all sense of responsibility," explains Osotimehin. "The natural thing to do was now to do something that actually gives me a global sense, given all the experience I have and the natural work that I'd been able to establish. "And I think linking back to what I did, practicing or as a minister of the HIV field, it was all about reproductive health to reproductive rights, gender, women's health and I think it just all fits." But above all, Osotimehin, a father of five, says what needs to be changed is the status of women around the world. "I think that for me is where the problem really is -- how we value women and girls in our societies," he says. "I think that we need to do far more than just legislation or policies, we need to confront these issues to make a difference." Watch video: Osotimehin: a global voice for women Osotimehin credits his mother for imparting the value of equality to him and shaping his views from an an early age. He says: "My mother was an entrepreneur, a mother, a wife, a community leader and she was very strong but she believed in equity of social justice, so I saw her as a role model." Osotimehin adds that whether it's though his current work at the UNFPA or any other posts in the future, he will always fight for women's empowerment. "I truly believe that women will change the world," he says. "I say that with all seriousness -- as a teacher in a medical school, my best students were women. "As physicians they are the best and, really, when you look at different aspects of life, even peace-building, women they build better peace. So, let's give them a chance."
If it wasn't already clear that Congress is done legislating this year, the scene inside and outside the Capitol on Wednesday illustrated that the midterm elections are in full swing. Just before the House Rules Committee began authorizing the Republican lawsuit against President Barack Obama, House Democrats gathered on the East Front steps just below the room where that hearing was to take place to unveil their "middle class jump start" agenda. With their dueling messages, they hoped to energize their respective political bases and propel supporters to the polls in November. The GOP decision to sue Obama over delaying the Obamacare employer mandate puts the politically-charged health care law -- an issue that motivates the most ardent GOP voters -- front and center. House Democrats argued in offering their middle class initiative that Republican priorities in Congress were skewed toward wealthy special interests at the expense of working families. Standing in front of sizable red white and blue convention-style placards with the phrases "Women Succeed," "Affordable Education" and "Make it in America," House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra tried to contrast the two political parties. "You can either sue the president of the United States, or you can do your job here at the House of Representatives and pass laws that help the middle class and working families," the California Democrat said. Citing the GOP lawsuit as a factor affecting the midterms, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in a Wednesday interview in the Washington Post set an ambitious goal of picking up 25 seats in the House. Democrats would need to take back 17 seats to regain control, a feat most Democrats concede isn't likely, especially in the sixth year of Obama's presidency. That's when a president's party historically loses seats. Kohn: Dear Speaker Boehner: Do your job instead Midterm focus for Democrats: Women Congressional Democrats on both sides of the Capitol are directing much of their message toward women, who they view as the critical voting bloc. Obama won re-election in 2012 with support from 55% of women compared to 44% for GOP nominee Mitt Romney. In an off-year congressional election, Democrats know they can't expect the same turnout. But they're talking about child care, contraception coverage, and education to maximize their chances. Democrats unveiled their "100 Day Action plan" on Wednesday, pledging to hold votes on bills focusing on women, if they win back the House. Those measures would be targeted at raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay for equal work, and boosting access to early childhood education. "Our agenda for women and families is 'When Women Succeed, America Succeeds,'" Pelosi said. This is not just the title of our agenda. This is a statement of absolute fact. And our agenda presents a stark contrast to what the Republicans have done to roll back women's rights and limit women's opportunities." Women's work: The GOP's glass ceiling Dems in the Senate In the Senate, Democrats seized on the Supreme Court's big Obamacare decision last month that employers of some for-profit companies were not required to provide insurance plans that covered contraception if they opposed on religious grounds. A Democratic bill to reverse that decision was blocked this week. But the Democratic narrative on the Supreme Court fits with what many in the party have labeled a Republican "war on women." Pelosi and other Democrats emphasized that decision was made by "five men" who were effectively dictating whether or not women could get access to contraceptives. 'Over and over again' "This is 2014, not 1914. Most Americans thought this was settled long, long ago. But for some reason, Republicans keep dragging us back here - over and over and over again," Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said. But the GOP is positioned well to retake control of the Senate in November, and top Republican leaders recognized that the issue could damage their standing among women if they didn't respond. Two female Republican senators -- Kelly Ayotte and Deborah Fischer -- wrote an editorial on Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal arguing Democrats were distorting the issue for political gain. "Contrary to the misleading rhetoric, the Hobby Lobby ruling does not take away women's access to birth control. No employee is prohibited from purchasing any Food and Drug Administration approved drug or device, and contraception remains readily available and accessible for all women nationwide," the two senators wrote. Senate Republicans introduced their own counterproposal that would codify that no employer can block a woman's access to FDA-approved contraception. Hobby Lobby is the retail business that successfully appealed the contraception case. Supreme Court women lash out at birth control decision A move to rally Republican base As the battle over a major women's issue played out in the Senate, House Republicans took their first step to approve a lawsuit arguing Obama violated the Constitution by making changes to Obamacare on his own instead of allowing Congress to act. House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions presided over a hearing with legal experts, and insisted the GOP move to sue was not about politics, but about protecting the authority of the legislative branch. "The separated powers between these branches are there in order to ensure that no one person would trample on the rights of others," the Texas Republican said. "My fear is that our nation is currently facing the exact threat that the Constitution is designed to avoid. Branches of government have always attempted to exert their influence on other branches, but the President, in my opinion, has gone too far," Sessions added. But the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Louise Slaughter, wasn't buying it. The suit was being "used to appease members of the Republican party who will not rest until President Obama is charged with articles of impeachment," she said. "This is a partisan, political stunt, timed to peak in the House of Representatives in November right as the midterm elections are happening." Motivating voters But both sides believe the suit will motivate voters. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released Web ads on Wednesday targeting 21 Republican incumbents and challengers with this message -- "Tell Republicans: Don't use our taxpayer dollars for your frivolous lawsuit." As the hearing was about to start, the House GOP's campaign arm tweeted an "urgent" message urging supporters to sign an online petition with this: "Stand with House Republicans as they protect your constitutional liberties and the country from continued executive abuse." The message was another tool for the campaign committee to gather names and contract information to help solicit money to support their candidates. Despite the argument by Republican candidates that Obama and his party are failing a competency test on a range of issues from the economy to the immigration crisis at the Southwest border, Obamacare is still a foundation of their campaigns. GOP candidates are expected to run ads focusing on the health law they despise, targeting specific problems voters in their districts are experiencing with it, such as cuts to a popular Medicare program. Zelizer: The World Cup of U.S. politics
May has been a bad month for relations between Taiwan and the Philippines. Taiwan has reacted angrily after one of its fishermen was killed by a Philippine coast guard vessel last week. It has recalled its diplomatic envoy from Manila, frozen applications from Filipinos seeking to work in Taiwan and held naval drills near Philippine waters. The Philippine coast guard has said the crew of one of its ships fired at the Taiwanese fishing boat on May 9 after it tried to ram a Philippine boat. Manila insists that the shooting took place in waters inside its exclusive economic zone and that the loss of life was "unintended." But Taiwan says the Philippine vessel sprayed the fishing boat with bullets in waters claimed by the exclusive economic zones of both countries. It says the 65-year-old fisherman, Hung Shih-cheng, was fatally shot in the back. The souring ties between the two countries are born out of the messy mix of competing territorial claims to parts of the South China Sea and nearby waters by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan on Friday described last week's shooting as a "cold-blooded murder," the Taiwanese national news agency CNA reported. Ma has so far deemed the Philippine response to the killing to be unsatisfactory. His government has demanded that Manila make a formal apology, compensate the losses, investigate and punish those responsible, and start talks between the two countries on a fishing agreement. Among the series of measures Taiwan has imposed this week to show its displeasure is a travel alert urging its citizens not to visit to the Philippines. The Philippine government, meanwhile, has started to show frustration with the Taiwanese stance. "We did what a decent member, a respectable member of the international community should have done," Edwin Lacierda, a spokesman for President Benigno Aquino III, said Thursday. "We have gone the extra mile." Aquino sent "a personal representative to extend his apology" and offer financial assistance to the family of the dead fisherman, Lacierda said, according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. Philippine authorities are investigating the shooting, he said. He warned that the measures imposed by the Taiwanese government would hurt the economies of both countries. Lacierda also appealed to the Taiwanese people not to hurt Filipinos living in Taiwan amid reports of harassment. But Garfie Li, a spokeswoman for Ma, said Lacierda's comments about going the extra mile were "were untrue and totally unacceptable," according to CNA. The United States, an ally of both the Philippines and Taiwan, has expressed regret" over the fisherman's death and urged the two sides "to work together and to ensure maritime safety, and refrain from actions that could further escalate tensions." China has supported Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province. "We have repeatedly condemned the violent killing of the innocent fisherman since the incident happened," Yang Yi, a spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Wednesday, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. "We have demanded that the Philippine side take the case seriously, find out the truth as quickly as possible and punish those responsible." Beijing and Manila are already at odds over a different territorial dispute in the region that led to a maritime standoff last year.
those suspected of storing graft gains with overseas family members. According to Chinese state media, Xinhua news agency, an unnamed official source says 866 of the implicated officials have been removed from their posts, including nine at a mayoral level. Another 200 have asked their families to return to China, in exchange for keeping their posts. Many officials have family overseas, including President Xi Jinping, whose daughter is currently enrolled at Harvard University. "Naked officials" refers to civil servants who have sent their families overseas allegedly with their ill-gotten assets. Moving money and family abroad is often seen as a precursor to officials' own flight. A report by the Ministry of Commerce cited in the English-language China Daily showed 4,000 corrupt officials had fled the country with at least $50 billion between 1978 and 2003. The names of the implicated Guangdong officials were not released, but Xinhua reported that 127 of the demoted officials are from Dongguan, a manufacturing hub dubbed "sin city" for its thriving prostitution trade. The southern Chinese city was also the target of a government vice crackdown in February. Another 128 officials were demoted in the city of Jiangmen. One of the first to lose their position from the crackdown is Fang Xuan, the deputy chief of the Guangzhou Party Committee. This month, Fang applied for retirement five months earlier than planned after being "found as a naked official," Xinhua also reported. China's netizens have largely been skeptical of the top-down anti-graft move. Many commented that the latest crackdown is inadequate for stamping out corruption. "The anti-corruption drive is basically using guerrilla warfare tactics, shooting in one place then moving on to another. It agitates the chickens and the dogs, but the tigers just relocate their dens," wrote Weibo user "Qin Qianhong." Since last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to clean up the tarnished image of the Communist Party, pushing anti-graft campaigns and pledging to target "mosquitoes" -- minor officials -- as well as "tigers" -- top officials. Critics say the war on corruption is just Xi's excuse for removing political opponents. Earlier this year, a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found that relatives of current and former top Chinese leadership are shareholders in offshore companies, allegedly storing away billions of illicit graft gains. The report included details of assets of two of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's children.
A tide of foreclosed properties has been sweeping into the beleaguered housing market, bringing down property values, dislocating families, and sending municipal governments scrambling to manage the crisis. But some buyers see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the gloomy headlines; they are buying up foreclosed properties at ultra-low prices. Real estate agent John Lynch of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West says he has interested buyers calling from all over the country, and as far away as Israel. Some are buying in bulk. "One investor I am working with right now wants to buy 200 houses all under 10K." Would-be homeowners are not excluded from the bonanza. Despite economic fears and the struggling housing market, Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire of McMullan Realty in Cleveland says this may be an ideal time to think about the dream of first-time home ownership. She tells the story of a friend who waded into the foreclosure market and came out ahead. "My girlfriend bought a house last summer. It has two baths, a two-car garage, and two fireplaces. She loves it. Her house is $350 a month, with taxes and insurance. She's in her late 40's and had been a renter all these years." Those are the high notes, but these agents tell other stories, too. There's the one about a far-away buyer who learned he owned a bunch of vacant lots, instead of houses. "It's not for the faint of heart," says Lynch. Lynch has seen the same house at foreclosure auctions more than once. "That hurts us all," says Lynch. A check-in with real estate professionals, home inspectors, and federal housing officials offers these words to the wise on buying a foreclosed property. • Budget carefully. Agent Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says don't let a small price tag lure you into a quick deal. Be sure to ask yourself a number of questions: Do you have the money for the extensive repairs these houses often need? "Do you have a crew. If you plan to rehab and then rent, can you afford the house if you don't find a tenant? If you do your homework, there's little risk," says Perkins-Stoudermire. • See the house for yourself. "You can't buy them sight unseen," says Bill Richardson, president of the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI). "If you're an investor from Chicago and you're buying in Tucson, you'll need someone to evaluate the house in person." This Old House: What to expect from a home inspection • Look at the neighborhood. Your homework should include evaluating the neighborhood. You may not be able to recoup the cost of the repairs if the value of the house is depressed by widespread foreclosures or high crime in the area. Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says she also encourages buyers to study the neighborhood's appeal at all hours, including at night. This Old House: How to identify a promising neighborhood • How long has the house been empty? The longer the vacancy the more damage there is, in most cases. Bill Richardson, of ASHI, says if a house hasn't been "moth-balled" carefully, a long list of ailments set in. "The plumbing seals dry out, sewer gases back up, and bugs that are in the sewer get a chance to get into the house. That's true for the sinks, toilets, and washer drains," says Richardson. • Was it winterized? Don't turn on the utilities until you know the condition of the pipes. If the pipes cracked during a cold spell, water will leak into the walls, and mold could take hold when you turn the water back on. This Old House: Dealing with mold • Look at the landscaping. ASHI's Bill Richardson warns, "If the house has been neglected, untrimmed trees, vines and bushes contribute to the deterioration of the house." Vines crawl into the windows, and tree seedlings send roots down into the foundation. "It doesn't take very big trees to mess up pavers, and dead branches crash into the house," says Richardson. • Contract for a private inspection. Banks generally require a home inspection when lending money for a mortgage. But even if you're paying completely out of pocket for an ultra-cheap find, all the pros say it's crucial to get an up-to-date inspection. Richardson says previous inspections "are only a snapshot in time," and conditions change dramatically. "There's no caretaker on these properties. I've looked at quite a few," says Richardson. "We've seen vandalism. We've seen previous owners steal cabinets and fixtures. Copper piping has been stolen." In some cases an inspection will prevent further damage. For example, if inspectors determine the pipes are cracked, repairs can be done in advance. Richardson said inspectors charge $300 to $500. • Consider a HUD house. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is currently holding approximately 39,000 houses whose previous owners held mortgages insured by the federal government. HUD houses go to market about six months after foreclosure. Local governments get the first option to buy. After that, buyers who pledge to live in the house have the first opportunity to offer a bid. If the house is still on the market after a period of about 10 days, the listing is opened to investors. Owner occupants end up with about half of HUD's properties, according to HUD officials. A fraction of the total foreclosure market, HUD's inventory is concentrated in Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and other states where the mortgage crisis has been especially severe. But if one of these houses suits your fancy, HUD spokesman LeMar Wooley says the feds offer a few advantages. "You will know the fair price of the property" because HUD updates its appraisals regularly. It offers a "property condition report" too, though that report is not updated. Wooley is thus among the chorus of experts urging buyers to pay for their own home inspection before closing the deal. If HUD appreciates the value of a good inspector, inspectors likewise say HUD houses are better protected. "The feds often take the steps to winterize the houses. They put anti-freeze in the traps, and drain the pipes. When HUD's involved it's a little bit better," says ASHI president Bill Richardson. • Don't expect to profit from a quick sale. Investors who buy intending to do as little as possible to a house, hoping to resell for a profit when the market turns around, may find little profit and a lot of headache. Some cities are cracking down on neglectful property owners, charging penalties that increase over time, and unmaintained homes lose value quickly. But real estate pros and housing officials report that, overall, investors are a welcome and all-too-scarce resource, and most are fixing up the houses they buy for rent or resell. What's more, investors and new owner-occupants might get the satisfaction of helping to turn a hard-hit neighborhood around. Get 2 Free Trial Issues COPYRIGHT © 2009 THIS OLD HOUSE VENTURES, INC.
a longtime officer who was leading efforts to train soldiers in Afghanistan -- was killed Tuesday at a military training facility in Kabul. An ISAF official said that the group was standing outside, and the attacker, who has been identified by the Afghan Ministry of Defense as an academy member named Rafiullah, shot from inside a nearby building at a distance of about 100 yards. The assailant had served in the academy for two and a half years, Zahir Azimi, an Afghan Ministry of Defense spokesperson, told CNN. Pentagon officials went out of their way to say the shooting would not change the relationship between U.S. and Afghan forces. "I've seen no indication that there's a degradation of trust between coalition members and their Afghan counterparts," Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. But the deadly ambush at a premier training facility for Afghan military officers raises questions about the vetting process for Afghan soldiers and also the upcoming handover of security to Afghan forces. "When something like this happens, in the least it creates a crisis of confidence for Afghans and for us," said Vali Nasr, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. So far, the Taliban has acknowledged the general's killing, but hasn't claimed responsibility for it. The Afghan Ministry of Defense continues to investigate the incident. The Pentagon isn't commenting on the possibility of Taliban involvement, saying the Afghan military and international forces are in the early stages of an investigation. Nasr told CNN's "The Situation Room" that the attack raises serious concerns as the United States prepares to withdraw forces from Afghanistan. "The Taliban have proven today they can infiltrate this force at will," he said. "The discipline we are seeking or that we are claiming is not there, and I think it is very difficult for the administration to say that everything is going according to plan, as if this is just an isolated incident and we can just leave." But it's still unclear whether the gunman had Taliban ties and whether he slipped through the military's screening process, said Philip Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst and former CIA official. "I don't think we should look and make judgments about the vetting process too quickly," he said. "You would think on the surface that maybe he was recruited by the Taliban. That's not necessarily the case." Witnessing the horrors of war sometimes inspires soldiers to turn against their onetime allies, he said. "He might have seen something in the last months or years... and sometimes there is an emotional switch that turns on after their recruitment, after their vetting, that leads them to say, 'I want to do something about this. I'm going to kill someone in the U.S. military,'" Mudd said. Insider attacks: When Afghan soldiers turns and kill allies 'Routine visit' turns deadly The attack occurred during a routine visit to the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul to look at improvements made at the school, Kirby said. In addition to the general's slaying, up to 15 coalition troops were wounded in the shooting rampage. The shooter was wearing an Afghan military uniform and is believed to be someone who had served for some time in a unit of the Afghan armed forces, Kirby said. "A person that we believe was an Afghan soldier opened fire and hit many with his weapon," he said. The Afghan Defense Ministry described the shooter as a "terrorist" and said Afghan soldiers shot him dead. General helped lead training Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno released a condolence statement confirming Greene's death. "Our thoughts and prayers are with Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene's family, and the families of our soldiers who were injured today in the tragic events that took place in Afghanistan," Odierno said in the statement, referring to other officers who were hurt. "These soldiers were professionals, committed to the mission. It is their service and sacrifice that define us as an Army. " Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, described the general as a very experienced officer who was a leader in the training command in Afghanistan. He was an expert in infrastructure and logistics, Kirby said. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed condolences on his official Facebook page Tuesday night. "We serve, and where we serve we are often at risk," he said. "God bless those wounded and killed in Afghanistan yesterday and their families." Insider attacks: 'A threat you can't completely eliminate' This isn't the first time people dressed in Afghan security forces uniforms have attacked coalition forces who have worked to thwart such violence. "The insider threat is one that we've been focused on for quite some time. ... It is a threat you can't completely eliminate," Kirby told CNN. But it's a threat that can be mitigated, he said. And officials stress that statistics show that the numbers of such attacks have decreased. In 2012, so-called "green on blue" insider attacks took the lives of dozens of coalition troops, and the U.S. command in Kabul halted some joint operations with Afghan security forces, CNN has previously reported. Two attackers wearing Afghan military uniforms killed two U.S. service members in February in Afghanistan, the military publication Stars and Stripes reported. In October 2013, a man in an Afghan soldier's uniform shot and killed an ISAF member in eastern Afghanistan, CNN reported. According to an April 2014 Pentagon report, insider attacks against ISAF forces declined from 48 attacks in 2012 to 15 attacks in 2013. In the first quarter of 2014, there were two insider attacks against ISAF. "Despite this sharp decline, these attacks may still have strategic effects on the campaign and could jeopardize the relationship between coalition and ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] personnel," the report reads. Kirby called insider attacks "a pernicious threat" that are "difficult to always ascertain, to come to grips with... anywhere, particularly in a place like Afghanistan." "Afghanistan is still a war zone," he said. Numerous security protocols were instituted a few years ago to help ensure military personnel are safe, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The United States will review the circumstances of Tuesday's shooting to see if any changes should be made. White House: Attack is 'painful reminder' of troops' sacrifice President Barack Obama was briefed about the shooting and called Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to get more information, Earnest said. "While we have made tremendous progress in disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda operations and leadership in Afghanistan and progress in winding down U.S. involvement in that conflict, this shooting, of course, is a painful reminder of the service and sacrifice that our men and women in uniform make every day for this country," Earnest said. In February, the Obama administration announced for the first time that it had begun planning for the possible withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of 2014 if Afghanistan did not sign a security agreement pertaining to rights of U.S. troops operating there. In May, Obama said that if the Afghan government signs a security agreement, virtually all U.S. forces would be out of the country by the end of 2016, shortly before his presidency ends. He called for 9,800 U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan after the end of 2014, along with some allied forces. The number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015, and a year later the U.S. military presence would scale down to what officials described as a "normal" embassy security contingent. Kirby told reporters Tuesday that Afghan National Security Forces "continue to perform at a very strong level of competence and confidence, and warfare capability." The U.S. military feels that the Afghan military "grows stronger by the week" and noted that they are already "in the lead in combat missions" throughout the country, he said. "They'll be completely in the lead for military operations by the end of the year," Kirby said. "We see no change in that." 2 U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi fired back Sunday at a CBS News' "60 Minutes" report that highlighted several instances of what it suggested could be "soft corruption." The show looked at the investments of various lawmakers -- including Pelosi, House Speaker John Boehner and Republican Rep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama -- who reportedly bought stocks around the same time legislation involving those investments was being discussed. Pelosi and her husband participated in an initial public offering of Visa in 2008, according to CBS. They bought 5,000 shares at the initial price of $44; two days later, shares were trading at $64, CBS said. The network reported the investment came at the same time a piece of legislation that was opposed by credit-card companies was making its way through the House. "Congress has never done more for consumers nor has the Congress passed more critical reforms of the credit card industry than under the Speakership of Nancy Pelosi," Pelosi spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement soon after the report aired Sunday night. "It is very troubling that 60 Minutes would base their reporting off of an already-discredited conservative author who has made a career of out attacking Democrats," he added. CBS said it used as a starting point for its story the research of Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank at Stanford University. About a year ago, he began work on a book about "soft corruption" in Washington, CBS reported. The network said it had independently verified the material it used. Pelosi's spokesman criticized the CBS story for failing to note that the "legislation in question was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on October 3, 2008 -- the day the House was consumed in passing TARP and also the last day the House was in session before the November election." It also failed to note that in September 2008, the House passed the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, Hammill said. "In the next Congress, the House and Senate passed and President Obama signed the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights and the Dodd-Frank legislation, which included a stronger, more direct approach to addressing swipe fees," the spokesman said. In addition to Pelosi, the CBS report took a look at the investments of of Bachus and Boehner. In mid-September 2008, Bachus, then a ranking member on the House Committee on Financial Services, met with then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and lawmakers about the imminent collapse of the global economy, CBS reported. At the same time, Bachus bought options funds, betting markets would go down, CBS said. He also traded General Electric stock, and roughly a third of GE's business is in financial services, CBS reported. Bachus declined to talk to CBS, but his office provided a statement that said the representative never trades on non-public information, or financial services stock. Meanwhile, Boehner, who in 2009 was the House Minority leader, bought health-insurance stocks during the health care debate, all of which increased in value after the so-called public option was killed, CBS reported. Boehner was very much against the public option. He also declined to be interviewed, but spoke to CBS' Steve Kroft at a press conference. "I have not made any decisions on day-to-day trading activities in my account -- and haven't for years. I don't -- I do not do it, haven't done it and wouldn't do it," he said. A senior House GOP aide told CNN that Boehner's financial adviser bought a range of blue chip stocks around the same time -- not just health care stocks -- after he closed out the retirement account from his small business. "The idea that the Republican leader in the House opposed the public option -- policy favored by the left of the left -- for personal profit is, frankly, stupid," said the aide. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.
Actor Thomas Guiry allegedly head-butted a police officer after he was told he was too drunk to board a flight at Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport last weekend, police said Wednesday. Guiry, 31, faces a felony charge of assault against a public servant in the Saturday incident, according to Houston Police spokesman John Cannon. United Airlines employees called police after they refused to let Guiry board Saturday, Cannon said. The airline workers determined he was too intoxicated to board the flight, but they wanted a police supervisor to decide if he was a candidate for a sobering center instead of being jailed for public intoxication, he said. Guiry became agitated and made repeated threats to the police sergeant after he was told he could go to the sobering center if he was compliant, Cannon said. After the threats, the officer told the actor he was under arrest, he said.  Guiry allegedly tried to kick the sergeant in the face as he was placing him under arrest. The head-butting happened as the sergeant tried to restrain him, Cannon said. Guiry was 11 when he made his acting debut in the film "The Sandlot." His career as a child actor also included the lead role in a "Lassie" movie remake in 1994 and "The Last Home Run" in 1996.  He's acted in several television series in recent years, including a recent episode of "Elementary."
Inter Milan moved into third place in Italy's Serie A after inflicting yet more misery on bottom-placed Bari with a 3-0 win. Late goals from Houssine Kharja, Giampaolo Pazzini and Wesley Sneijder sealed three points for the Nerazzurri, who are now seven points behind city rivals and league leaders AC Milan with a game in hand. It was their fifth win in the last six games since former AC Milan coach Leonardo took over from Rafael Benitez. The only stain on a good night for Inter was a punch thrown by Romanian defender Christian Chivu at opponent Marco Rossi. The officials missed the incident but Chivu may be retrospectively punished. A poor playing surface gave rise to a scrappy first half of few chances. Bari did threaten through Sergio Almiron and Simone Bentivoglio before Inter's Brazilian defender Maicon flashed a shot wide of the post for the defending champions. The home side again went close in the early stages of the second half when Alessandro Parisi forced Julio Cesar into a save. But with 20 minutes to go Inter made the breakthrough as Kharja, from Morocco, swapped passes with Samuel Eto'o before firing low into the net. With Bari desperately seeking an equalizer Inter added two more goals late on. First Pazzini scored his third goal in two games since his $16m move from Sampdoria -- his shot squirmed under Bari goalkeeper Jean Francois Gillet in injury time. Then Dutch international Sneijder rounded off the scoring, finishing from close range after Kharja's lay-off.
hiding. "I heard these pops and I thought they were firecrackers, but then I saw a teacher run out with his side kind of bloody," League told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront." "You don't think something's going to happen like that -- especially to your school. It's kind of, like, crazy," she said. Details about what led to the shooting weren't immediately available. The gunman is believed to have used a rifle. Anderson said the shooter entered the building that houses the school gym. Hoffman was shot and killed in a locker room. The shooter was found in a separate restroom, Anderson said. He thanked officers for their quick response. He also thanked injured teacher Todd Rispler, who initiated the school lockdown despite being hurt. "Without the quick and well-executed response, this tragedy could have been much worse," the Reynolds School District said in a statement. Anxious parents waited for news that their children were safe. One couple, Craig Tuholski and Tawnjia Reimer, were talking with CNN affiliate KGW, about how agonizing the wait for news was, when Tuholski's cell phone rang. "Is that Chris?" Reimer asked before letting out a sigh of relief. "Oh, thank God." "That's what we were waiting for," Tuholski said after hanging up. About an hour after the shooting, Oregon State Police said the area was secure and the situation was contained. Obama: 'Levels of gun violence off the charts' The shooting, the latest in a long string of school shootings, sparked reaction nationwide. "Our hearts go out to the Reynolds HS community. How many more students must we lose before committing to reduce gun violence in our schools?" Secretary of Education Arne Duncan asked on his Twitter account. Speaking in Washington, President Barack Obama said the nation should be ashamed of its inability to get tougher gun restrictions through Congress in the aftermath of mass shootings that he said have become commonplace in America. "Our levels of gun violence are off the charts. There's no advanced, developed country on Earth that would put up with this," he said in response to a question about gun violence. Most members of Congress are "terrified" of the National Rifle Association, the President said, adding that nothing will change until public opinion demands it. "The country has to do some soul searching about this. This is becoming the norm, and we take it for granted, in ways that as a parent are terrifying to me," Obama said. CNN first learned of the shooting through reports on Twitter.

Hosts Qatar have qualified for the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup after a comfortable 3-0 win over Group A strugglers Kuwait at the Khalifa Stadium. Goals from Bilal Mohammed -- who headed home after 12 minutes -- and Mohamed El Sayed (16th minute) gave Bruno Metsu's men a comfortable lead which they never looked like letting slip. Fabio Cesar rounded the evening off in style with a well-taken free kick in the 86th minute to seal their second win of this year's competition. Iran first into Asian Cup quarterfinals Meanwhile, China -- Qatar's rivals for the runners-up spot in Group A -- could only draw 2-2 against group winners Uzbekistan meaning they crash out of the tournament early yet again. Yu Hai gave China the lead in the seventh minute only for the Uzbeks to mount a comeback. Strikes from Akhmedov on the half hour and CSKA Moscow forward Alexander Geynrih shortly after the break saw them take the lead. But it was short lived as Junmin executed a brilliant free kick to level the scores. Qatar will now face the team who finish top of Group B, which looks likely to be Japan -- one of the favorites to win the tournament.
U.S. President Barack Obama must speak out and declare that some of the behavior of the clerical regime in Iran is unacceptable, former Obama administration official Ray Takeyh said Monday. Takeyh, who served as an adviser in the State Department last year and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour the U.S. must also be open to negotiating some sort of deal to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions. "You can have negotiations with Iran, as the United States has had negotiations with many adversarial countries while also at the same time disapproving on the internal practices of those regimes," he said. Takeyh's comments came just over a week after the bloodiest clashes between pro-democracy protesters and government security forces in months, clashes that left at least eight people dead. Days after those clashes, hundreds of thousands of pro-government demonstrators held rallies in Tehran and other cities. Those protests coincided with new tensions over Iran's nuclear program, a program the United States says is intended to build a nuclear weapon. Tehran insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes alone and says it's up to the West to decide whether to accept Iran's proposals on further enriching its uranium. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday the United States remains open to the possibility of further negotiations with Tehran, despite Iran's refusal to make significant progress towards a deal before January 1 this year, as Obama has demanded. Clinton told reporters the U.S. is holding discussions with its partners and like-minded nations about possible new sanctions and other forms of pressure. Takeyh said he expects the United States and its allies will try to ratchet up economic pressure on Iran, targeting in particular the Revolutionary Guard and its business interests. "So you will begin to see intensification of economic pressure on Iran in the hope that external pressure, combined with internal pressure, will cause Iran to adjust its behavior," he said. Takeyh added that he believes the Iranian government internally is rather weak and vulnerable and may seek some sort of agreement abroad at least to mitigate international pressure. But he said the opposition movement in Iran is also somewhat incoherent. "It doesn't have a central nervous system. It doesn't even have an identifiable set of leaders or even a coherent ideology. It is a protest movement." He said the longer the movement sustains itself, though, the more it will develop an ideology and a leadership. A leading critic of the pro-democracy protesters, Professor Mohammad Marandi of Tehran University, told Amanpour that opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's position has been severely weakened by the December 27 protests in Iran. "The opposition that protested on (the Shiite Muslim holy day of) Ashura made a very major tactical mistake by being very brutal towards the police and also by carrying out these protests on a day of public mourning," Marandi said. But one of the most fearless critics of Iran's regime, former Iranian Member of Parliament Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, rejected Marandi's assessment. She said everyone still supports Moussavi. "The government is not able to arrest all the population in Iran", she said. "The people of Iran need fundamental change in the country and I am so optimistic that they will see this change in the country in the future."
It seemed as if billionaire Donald Sterling apparently didn't have enough money left after buying apartments, cars and dresses for V. Stiviano to pay for appropriate legal or communications advice before his exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. We don't know for sure, but that's the only conclusion one can draw from the Los Angeles Clippers owner's disastrous attempt at exoneration that aired Monday night on "AC 360." Sterling broke just about every rule of crisis communications during his taped and edited interview with Cooper, starting with issuing an obviously half-hearted apology for his racially offensive remarks surreptitiously recorded by Stiviano during a private discussion. Channeling Richard Nixon, Sterling three times declared unconvincingly "I am not a racist," when fumbling for an explanation for why he ranted in an audio recording about his disapproval of Stiviano being seen with black men at Clippers home basketball games. "Twenty-five percent of my whole game are black people and I love them. I can't explain some of the stupid, foolish uneducated words that I uttered." Opinion: Sterling apology was an epic fail The interview went downhill from there, with Sterling rambling from subject to subject, with no apparent goal except to somehow look sympathetic to viewers. Obviously he failed. Here are some of the most important rules of crisis communications he broke during his time on camera: 1. Apologize sincerely, then move on to say what you are doing to ensure the transgression never happens again. Announce that you are entering rehabilitation, meeting with the group you have offended to make amends or taking sensitivity training. But you must demonstrate that you are taking concrete steps to correct your future behavior. Sterling apologized to his 29 fellow NBA franchise owners and to Commissioner Adam Silver, yet he neglected to say what he would do to improve. 2. Make a sacrifice. Whether you are wealthy or not, you must give something up as a gesture of your commitment to seek forgiveness from the people you have offended. If you offend the African-American community, a generous contribution of money and your personal time to an inner-city charity may be in order. If you offend a religious group, a donation to a church or charitable group is appropriate. And the bigger the offense, the larger the gift should be. In Sterling's case, we're probably talking millions of dollars and hundreds of hours. 3. Ask forgiveness of those whom you have offended. Sterling assumed that NBA players, owners, fans and everyone in America would understand his plight and give him a pass because he is a well-intentioned 80-year-old billionaire with a big mouth. He skipped a major step when he forgot to even ask. 4. Never blame others for the crisis you have created. First, Sterling claimed Stiviano baited him into making his racially offensive comments. Then he said she wasn't really a bad person and moved on to gratuitously criticize NBA Hall of Famer, philanthropist and businessman Earvin "Magic" Johnson. "What does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything. He acts so holy. He made love to every girl in every city in America and he had AIDS," Sterling said. "Is he an example to children? Because he has money, he is able to treat himself. ... He should fade into the background." With these statements, Sterling created another crisis for himself and for the NBA. 5. Never blame the news media. Sterling claimed that NBA players and owners still like him and that he has received "thousands of phone calls" of support from friends and colleagues. Who then is attacking the Clippers owner for his remarks? "It's the media that's out to get me," Sterling said. Cooper and every other journalist watching the interview or seeing the news reports afterward is now his foe, whether or not they were before he made that comment. Appearing on CNN immediately after the jaw-dropping interview, African-American film maker Spike Lee perhaps captured it best for all communications experts when he said of Sterling: "Why do they let him speak? Who's around him?" Who indeed.
He never knew the name of the woman he killed all those years ago, back in Arizona. Then Matthew Gibson started getting mysterious messages, at least some bearing the name, "Anita Townshed." So, according to police, in June the 55-year-old drove from his North Carolina home all the way to Arizona, where he walked into the Winslow, Arizona, police department and confessed. The thing is, as the Charlotte Observer newspaper noted in breaking the story Monday, the name of Gibson's victim wasn't Anita. It was Barbara Brown. And police didn't know anything about Gibson. "I think because he recently found religion he was starting to feel guilty and wanted to do the right thing," said his attorney, Ron Gilleo. Gibson had never had any run-ins with the law, not even a traffic ticket, Gilleo said. "He could have gotten away with this," Bullhead City police Detective Mary Garcia said. Instead, he was recently sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. The saga began in 1997, when police found Brown's body along the Colorado River in Bullhead City, about 50 miles southeast of Las Vegas. According to the Charlotte Observer, Gibson told police he had met Brown one night and the two went back to his trailer. He found her "loud and obnoxious," the newspaper reported, but she refused to leave. He used a large flashlight to beat her to death, Garcia said, put her body in the trunk of his car and dumped it in a park. He tossed the flashlight on a road heading toward Las Vegas. A few months later, he moved from Bullhead City, according to police. Years of drifting intervened. Drug use, too, although the Observer reported Gibson quit a few years ago. 3 steps to make a murderer confess Then, this summer, the messages started arriving. He got text messages, police said, and the Observer reported he told authorities he had gotten a telephone call from Walmart telling him Townshed's prescription was ready. He also got a Walmart advertisement with no return name or address, according to the newspaper. He felt, according to a police report, that he had a "contract on his head." On June 5, he walked into the Winslow Police Department and said he wanted to confess to a crime, according to the police report. Bullhead City police, alerted by colleagues in Winslow, searched their files and found Brown's death. 2013: Florida man allegedly kills wife, posts confession, photo on Facebook They got a warrant for his arrest. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter last week and was sentenced to 10½ years in prison, Gilleo said. "I had no intention to take a life," the Observer quoted Gibson as saying in a statement to police. "But it did happen, and I as a man will accept my punishment." Gilleo said his client has always said he never wanted to kill Brown. "He is very remorseful and sorry this all happened."
Sitting in the first lady's box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform, Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported. While the President dedicated only a brief part of his State of the Union address to immigration, his message went beyond his speech, and the evidence was sitting among the guests invited to join the first lady in the viewing box. "I feel honored and excited to be here. If it wasn't for receiving my DACA last summer I wouldn't have been able to attend the State of the Union," Avila told CNN. The 23-year-old and his siblings are just one of the many thousands of recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Avila was illegally brought into the United States with his younger brother and sister when he was 9 years old DACA is a government program enacted in 2012 that stopped deporting some undocumented young people and instead granted them temporary work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation. Obama hits the road to push State of the Union message The recipients have become one of the most visible groups advocating for immigration reform. Avila caught the attention of the Obama administration during his 22-day fast on the National Mall in support of immigration reform last November. And, for the last two years, Avila's been working as a voter engagement coordinator for Mi Familia Vota, a non-profit Latino civic engagement program. "At the time, immigration reform seemed like it was dead. We won the hearts of the American people. We revived the conversation," Avila said. Obama pleaded for cooperation and pointed out how getting immigration reform done this year was important for the country's recovering economy. "If we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement -- and fix our broken immigration system," Obama said. Without attacking House Republicans, the President described how both parties in the Senate passed a comprehensive bill last summer and said both parties in the House want to do the same. He said immigration reform would not only help the economy but shrink the deficit by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades. "When people come here to fulfill their dreams -- to study, invent, contribute to our culture -- they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody. So let's get immigration reform done this year," he said. Obama spoke of immigration reform in broad strokes but that might have something to do with the plans of House Republican leaders to outline their principles for immigration reform at a party meeting this week. Opinion: Can Obama deliver action on inequality? "We're going to outline our standards, principles of immigration reform and have a conversation with members," House Speaker John Boehner said during a news conference after a party meeting. Obama steered clear of specific immigration reform policies. There was no mention of stopping the deportations of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, despite countless pleas from activists all over the country. Avila and his siblings no longer live in fear of being deported but his parents face that threat every time they leave their homes for work. "I grew up with the fear of being deported. My mom would always tell me to put my head down," Avila said. "I still have the constant fear of my parents being deported. They are fearful and targeted even though they earn their living in an honest way," said Avila, "One of the reasons that I keep strong is for them." Still, Avila remains optimistic that immigration reform will happen in 2014. "We are closer than ever before. It shouldn't take any longer," Avila said.
The health of a South Carolina woman battling a rare flesh-eating bacteria has "slightly improved," a spokeswoman for a Greenville hospital said Thursday, though the new mother remains sedated and in critical condition. Lana Kuykendall has "undergone 11 debridement surgeries to remove tissue since being admitted May 11" to Greenville Memorial Hospital, spokeswoman Sandra Dees said Thursday by e-mail. But unlike 24-year-old Aimee Copeland of Georgia -- who has lost a leg, part of her abdomen, her remaining foot and her hands as she fights the same disease, according to online updates from her father, Andy Copeland -- no parts of Kuykendall's body have been amputated. "Last night, Darren told the family in his update that 'Lana's vitals and blood work is good.' This is a good day for her, and we will take it," said Brian Swaffer, Kuykendall's brother, in a message relayed by the hospital. Kuykendall gave birth to twins, Ian and Abigail, on May 7 in Atlanta. At that time, Kuykendall, a paramedic, was believed to be healthy. But a few days later she went to hospital near her South Carolina home after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband Darren, a firefighter, told CNN last week. Surviving a flesh-eating disease She was diagnosed then with necrotizing fasciitis and has been intubated and sedated every day since, according to her brother and the hospital. A number of bacteria, which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections, can lead to the disease. When it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. iReport: I survived Flesh Eating Disease...barely Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Just last Sunday, Kuykendall had undergone seven surgeries for her ailment -- meaning she has had four more such operations in recent days. Swaffer said, as he did days ago, that the family is thankful the disease remains confined to his sister's legs. While hooked up to a respirator, Kuykendall is now breathing on her own, according to her brother. Her baby boy and girl, who are being cared for by relatives and friends, remain healthy and are doing well. "Please pray with us that Lana will recover quickly to a point where she will be able to interact with and enjoy this special time in their lives," Swaffer said. Andy Copeland posted an update earlier Thursday about his daughter Aimee, who is fighting the same disease as Kuykendall in the intensive care unit of Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. She was with friends May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when the zip line that she was holding snapped. She fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Her father has written regularly since about her situation, with the psychology department at the University of West Georgia -- where Aimee had been pursuing her master's degree in psychology -- also posting online updates. On Thursday, her father wrote on Facebook that Aimee "has finally stabilized to the point that she has not needed any ventilator assistance for over 24 hours." "Each breath is a victory. Each heart beat is a cause for celebration. When she opens her eyes, that is like a ticker tape parade down Broadway. When she mouths words, angelic hosts rejoice," Andy Copeland said. "That is what each moment is like for us." He described several such moments from earlier in the week, including Aimee lighting up after listening to a "private concert" from a musician who'd written a song about her, waking up to talk of "treats" in the hospital and sitting up in a chair. "When the doctors put Aimee in that chair, their expectations were to give her an hour," Andy Copeland said, elaborating on the latter milestone. "Five hours later, Aimee decided it was time to lie down. Had she been running an Olympic marathon, I think Aimee would have experienced a record-breaking, gold-medal moment." CNN's William Hudson and Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.
where the local community has shown high levels of resistance to measures to limit the disease's spread -- was the worst-affected in Guinea, with half the new cases for the week, the report said. The response to the Ebola epidemic has now moved to a second phase, WHO said, "as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic. "To achieve this goal as quickly as possible, efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding, case management, safe burials, and community engagement is used as effectively as possible." There have been more than 22,000 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases since the outbreak began, with almost 8,800 known deaths. According to the latest WHO report, children are less susceptible than adults to contracting the virus, which spreads through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. People aged 15 to 44 are approximately three times more likely to be affected than children aged up to 14, while adults aged 45 and older are almost four times more likely to be affected than are children. Even as the number of cases drops, scientists around the world continue to study the virus in a bid to understand how it works and help develop more effective vaccines against it. Dr. Anavaj Sakuntabhai, human geneticist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, is part of a team working to sequence the virus and monitor how it mutates. "It's very important for us to follow what happens with the virus sequence," he told CNN. While the virus is not that mutated yet, he said, "It's important for us to monitor how it changes and see whether it is more contagious or more lethal." His team is using samples from blood collected from Guinea and processed by colleagues based in Dakar, Senegal, who've been working on the Ebola project since April last year. Sakuntabhai's team has sequenced about 20 samples so far and hopes to do another 100 in the coming weeks, ultimately sequencing several hundred. Many people's fears have focused on whether the virus could change to become airborne, but it doesn't appear to be easy for it to mutate sufficiently to alter the mode of transmission, he said. Sakuntabhai said it was normal for the virus to change and that it's "not something to be frightened of at the moment." CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.
Claims of extortion and laughter-inducing testimony stemming from legal advice on e-mails highlighted Tuesday's proceedings in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial. Randy Phillips, the chief executive officer of AEG Live, disclosed that his lawyers advised company executives not to review old e-mails before testifying. That strategy could explain the high number of "I don't recall" answers by Paul Gongaware, the concert promoter's co-CEO, during his deposition and six days of testimony that have just concluded. Phillips, who followed Gongaware on the witness stand Tuesday afternoon, said he believed Jackson's mother and three children were trying to extort money from his company, which he insisted bears no liability in the pop icon's death in 2009. The Jacksons' lawsuit accuses the company of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's drug overdose death. AEG lawyers contend Jackson chose, paid and controlled Murray, who infused him with the surgical anesthetic propofol almost every night for a month to help the singer rest as he prepared for his comeback "This Is It" concerts. AEG exec: I didn't know Michael Jackson abused drugs Jackson lawyer Brian Panish, who has been previously told by the judge not to argue with witnesses, quickly tangled with Phillips. "Please don't argue with me because then I will argue back and get in trouble," Panish told Phillips at one point. "Then that's an incentive for me," Phillips joked. The feisty chemistry between lawyer and witness promises to keep jurors, who often chuckle at Panish's courtroom behavior, on the edge of their seats for the next day or so. Gongaware's testimony was punctuated with so many "I don't recall" responses that jurors began laughing at one point. He frequently said he couldn't recall sending or reading key e-mails in the case, although his e-mail address was on them. Panish asked Gongaware whether he thought it would have been better for him if he had reviewed documents and e-mails before testifying. "I relied on the advice of my attorney," he said. With his testimony concluded, Gongaware will resume his responsibilities as tour manager for the Rolling Stones. "All this legal stuff, I don't understand it," he said. What killed Elvis? It's a question at Michael Jackson's death trial Phillips, a law school dropout, seemed ready to rumble when he entered court after Gongaware. But he acknowledged that until two weeks ago, he had not looked at any of his old e-mails to refresh his memory. "They felt it would be better if I went in without preparation," he said, referring to his lawyers. AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putman said outside of court that the volume of documents they would have needed to review was massive, making it impossible for them to prepare. E-mails that AEG Live executives sent and received in the months before Jackson's death include one in which Phillips assures show director Kenny Ortega that the company has "checked out" Murray and found him to be very successful. AEG Live executives later acknowledged they did not do a background check on Murray, who a police detective testified was in debt for more than $1 million dollars and faced foreclosure on his home. "I wrote it in the e-mail that I thought at the time he had been checked out," Phillips testified Tuesday. He wrote that Murray was successful "because that's what I was told," he said. "In retrospect, it's not 100% true," Phillips said. "There's what I thought at the time versus what I learned afterwards." Phillips, Gongaware and other AEG Live executives ignored red flags that should have alerted them that Jackson's life was in danger, the Jackson lawsuit contends. Murray signed and faxed his $150,000-a-month contract back to AEG Live, but with Jackson's death the next day on June 25, 2009, Phillips didn't sign it. AEG lawyers argue that means it was not a fully executed agreement and Murray was never hired by them. Promoter grilled about 'smoking gun' e-mail
Did French intelligence services miss vital clues as Mohammed Merah showed signs of growing radicalization? In the words of the French newspaper, L'Express, on Thursday: "Did the security services fail in their surveillance?" How do western intelligence agencies choose who to focus on as terror suspects, amid hundreds that express or harbor militant views? Do they have sufficient resources; and where lies the balance between surveillance and the protection of civil liberties? These are just a few of the questions emerging after Merah's killings. Merah had been on the radar of the French intelligence service for several years. He'd been detained in Afghanistan in 2010 and repatriated to France -- only to return to the Afghan-Pakistan border area in August of last year. He'd been interviewed by the French security services last November after returning from the Af-Pak area a second time. But he had apparently persuaded them, even showing photographs he had taken, that he had been on a tourist trip. In addition, it has emerged that Merah was on a U.S. no-fly-list, according to U.S. officials, which would have prevented him from boarding any U.S.-bound flight. There were also worrisome signs before he left for Afghanistan. Two years ago, Merah "held" a 15-year-old boy in his apartment and forced him to watch videos of al Qaeda beheadings. When confronted by his mother, he assaulted her -- and she made a report to police. French media report that after the incident Merah donned military fatigues and yelled "I'm al Qaeda" in the street near the woman's house. By then, he already had multiple convictions for minor offenses, and several jail sentences. Both he and his older brother Abdelkader were known to the security services because of their membership of a small Salafist group in Toulouse. French prosecutors say Abdelkader was implicated in a network sending Islamic militants to Iraq in 2007 but not charged because of inadequate evidence. He is currently under arrest but has not been charged. But at the same time Merah did not fit any "conventional" profile of a jihadist-to-be. He was a motor-bike enthusiast and soccer player. According to his attorney, Christian Etelin, he was usually quiet and courteous -- "not rigid to the point of falling into fanaticism." But Etelin said there were signs of a "dual personality" in Merah. Friends have told French reporters of their shock at his sudden metamorphosis to killer. French Interior Minister Claude Geant defended the work of France's equivalent of the FBI, the Direction Centrale du Renseignement IntÃ©rieur. The DCRI "follows a lot of people who are involved in Islamist radicalism," he said Thursday. "Expressing ideas, showing Salafist opinions is not enough to bring someone before justice," he said. Nor had there been any "criminal tendencies" among Islamist radicals in Toulouse, which has a large population of North African origin, he said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a radio network Thursday that "light must be shed" on events leading up to the shootings by Merah. "I understand that one can ask whether there was a failing or not. As I don't know if there was a failing, I can't tell you what kind of failing, but light must be shed on that," Juppe said on Europe 1. One avenue of inquiry may be communication between different security agencies in France. For example the DCRI tracks French citizens who have returned from overseas travels; the role of the external spy service DGSE includes keeping tabs on foreigners in France suspected of links to extremism. Other questions include the judicial authority needed for some forms of surveillance, although police in France can tap telephones with the approval of the Prime Minister and an administrative panel. There is also the issue of budget cuts at the DCRI over the past few years. Whether and how the DCRI dropped the ball in Merah's case has already entered the bloodstream of the presidential race in France, with the candidate of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, demanding an inquiry into whether the intelligence services took necessary precautions in Merah's case and complaining of the government's laxity in the face of the "fundamentalist risk." Another candidate, FranÃ§ois Bayrou, expressed surprise that Merah had been able to buy weapons without drawing attention, after so many convictions. In past cases efforts by terror suspects to make bombs, or gather the materials to do so, have triggered alerts. For example, attempts to buy large amounts of fertilizer or other ingredients -- such as hydrogen peroxide -- used in bomb-making are often relayed to law enforcement agencies. An attempt by Najibullah Zazi to contact a handler in the Afghan-Pakistan border area as he tried make the high explosive PETN in a Denver motel room was intercepted by counter-terrorism officers. Zazi planned suicide bomb attacks on the New York subway; he is now serving a life sentence in federal prison. By contrast, planning a gun attack -- such as those in Toulouse or at Fort Hood -- is less likely to trigger alarms. Guns are easier to acquire (though less so in Europe than in the United States) and easier to use than home-made bombs. That's perhaps why al Qaeda propagandists like American-born Adam Gadahn have urged followers in the United States to buy weapons at gun shows. "America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle," Gadahn said in a video posted last year. Across Europe and in the United States, radicalization within rapidly growing North African and South Asian populations has stretched domestic intelligence services, especially given substantial traffic between western countries and places like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. Some previous terror cases - in Minneapolis, the United Kingdom and Germany -- have shown second-generation immigrants to be less assimilated than their parents, and more conflicted about their surroundings. Certainly that was the case among the bombers who carried out the July 2005 subway attacks in Britain, and among young some 20 Somali-Americans who suddenly left to wage jihad with al Shabaab in 2008. Those who are "self-radicalized," who remain beyond any cell structure, who drift from one job or place of residence to another (as Merah did) are the most difficult to track. And counter-terrorism experts say a myriad of factors, many of them unpredictable, may be involved in pushing an individual from expressing militant views into committing bloody acts. Even apparently obvious signs have been missed in previous terror cases. When British intelligence broke up a plot in 2004 to use fertilizer in a series of attacks, it discounted the plotters' links to two men - Mohammed Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer. The pair went on to commit suicide bombing attacks on the London subway in July 2005. The UK domestic intelligence agency MI5 said in a statement later that Khan and Tanweer "appeared as petty fraudsters in loose contact with members of the plot. There was no indication that they were involved in the planning of any kind of terrorist attack in the UK." Similarly, new research into the planning of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, published in the latest edition of the CTC Sentinel by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, shows extensive contacts between the plotters and al Qaeda's leadership. For two years, according to author Fernando Reinares, a key intermediary who had been part of an al Qaeda cell in Spain since the mid-1990s planned the attacks, returning to Spain from Pakistan months before the bombings. Reinares, who became a senior adviser on counter-terrorism in the Spanish government after the attacks, writes that when the Madrid cell was dismantled in 2001, there was insufficient evidence to prosecute at least three men. All became ringleaders in the bombings that killed 191 people on March 11 2004. Germany's problems in tracking right-wing extremists are also instructive. After several immigrants were murdered by neo-Nazis between 2000 and 2007, investigations established a lack of co-ordination between different state and federal agencies. The government responded with a plan to establish a central database of right-wing extremists available to the police and state authorities. But legal experts have questioned the criteria for including suspects and the blurring of lines between intelligence services and the police. Some critics also say such databases can include so many names that they become redundant. By any standard, the record of the French intelligence services has been impressive to date, aided by some of Europe's toughest anti-terrorism laws. More than 200 people in France have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 2001. A French counter-terrorism source told CNN in 2010 that the security services had established a large network of informants within France's Muslim communities - but cautioned that it had proved much more difficult to recruit informers among the younger generation of French Muslims. On Thursday, President Nicolas Sarkozy announced plans for legislation that would make it an offense for anybody to view jihadist websites regularly in France or travel abroad for jihadist training. There has been no terror attack on mainland France since 1995, when a series of bombings was claimed by a group calling itself the Armed Islamic Group general command. One of the devices exploded at a Toulouse police station. The man behind the attacks, Khaled Kelkal, was also of Algerian origin and had grown up in a poor district of Lyon. But the 17 years of peace since is unlikely to spare the DCRI from some penetrating questioning after the events of the last week. CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank contributed to this story
Turkish football club Fenerbahce have been excluded from European competitions for two years after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld a ban issued by UEFA. Fenerbahce were handed the sanction by European football's governing body for fixing matches to help the team win the 2011 Turkish Super Lig title. The Istanbul team had been due to enter the second-tier Europa League after losing to English team Arsenal in a two-legged Champions League playoff. Fenerbahce were not immediately available for comment. The CAS also upheld a one-year ban meted out to Ukrainian team Metalist Kharkiv, also for match-fixing. Metalist were replaced by PAOK Thessaloniki in the Champions League qualification competition following the original verdict earlier this month. PAOK were subsequently eliminated by German club Schalke. UEFA will meet on Thursday to discuss who will take Fenerbahce's place in the Europa League. "UEFA welcomes today's decisions of the CAS rejecting the appeals made by Fenerbahce SK and FC Metalist Kharkiv against the UEFA Appeals Body decisions of 15 July 2013 and 14 August 2013 respectively," read a UEFA statement. "The UEFA Emergency Panel will meet on Thursday afternoon to decide on the consequences the confirmed exclusion of Fenerbahce SK from the 2013/14 UEFA club competitions will have on the Europa League."
A Pakistani politician and his bodyguard were killed Monday in a suicide attack in northwest Pakistan, a police official told CNN. Hanif Jadoon had just finished morning prayers on the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha when a bomber approached his car and detonated his explosives, police official Muhammad Ejaz Khan said. The attack took place in the Swabi district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Islamabad. Jadoon was a member of the Awami National Party, a secular party often targeted by the Taliban. Nine others were injured in the attack. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, police said.
Terrorists are likely to use a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the world in the next five years, a blue-ribbon panel assembled by Congress has concluded. Police watch over travelers at New York's Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving. They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one -- and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN. "The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension. It would be 9/11 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed," former Sen. Bob Graham said. He cited the flu virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example. "Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago," he said.  Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack » The U.S. government "needs to move more aggressively to limit" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report. Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary. "The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority ... they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world," he said. "It is not going to be cheap. It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices. It won't be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals. But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so," he added. Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out. Biological weapons "are more available," he said. "Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals. Other serious pathogens are available in equally accessible forms." "There are so many scientists who have the skills to convert a pathogen from benign, helpful purposes into an illicit, very harmful weapon," he added. But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorism, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals. "Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons," said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday. CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening. It cited testimony before the commission from former Sen. Sam Nunn, who said that the "risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding." The report recommends a range of measures, including increased security and awareness at biological research labs and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons. "Many biological pathogens and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured -- and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists," the report warned. The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, and about Pakistan, which it described as "the intersection of nuclear weapons and terrorism." While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally, the report said, "the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas" in Pakistan. The tribal areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Congress created the commission to investigate and report on WMD and terrorism in line with a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, which compiled a report on the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Commissioners heard testimony from more than 250 experts from around the world over the course of their six-month investigation. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.
(CNN)"Hot Tub Time Machine 2" resurrects the time-traveling, R-rated antics of the cabin crew, with Adam Scott stepping in for John Cusack in the Steve Pink-directed follow-up to the 2010 hit comedy. More: Jessica Williams is next 'Daily Show' host in 'Hot Tub Time Machine 2' Starring Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson, Clark Duke, Gillian Jacobs and Chevy Chase, Paramount and MGM's Oscar-weekend release is tipped to earn $15 million or more. It was pushed back from its original Christmas Day release date, when it was set to square off against "The Interview" with Seth Rogen and James Franco. See what top critics are saying about "Hot Tub Time Machine 2": The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore calls it "a flop-sweaty cash grab that gives a bad name to sequels in which key talent has jumped ship. ... Suffering from much more than awkwardness over the absence of the original's top-billed Cusack, though it is certainly awkward about that, the film makes us wonder why we enjoyed spending time with his three returning costars in the first place. ... Scott fills the cast's likeability void nicely. But the character bears the brunt of the meanest gags in an intensely mean-spirited, arguably misogynistic film, one so dumb about its attempts to wring humor from taboos that it at one point has the victim of forcible sodomy pay a dreamy compliment to the size of his assailant's genitals." More: 'Hot Tub Time Machine 2' Spot Mocks Deflate-gate USA Today's Claudia Puig gives it two stars out of four, writing, "Some of the gags are stupid-funny, others are just puerile, making for a hit-or-miss experience. The screenplay presents the thinnest of plots. ... Don't expect consistency or much logic." Altogether, "Like the first foray, the sequel is a good-natured raunch-fest that induces eye-rolling about as much as it does laughter. ... For those who liked the first movie and find a plethora of penis jokes hilarious, this is a fitting sequel. But others should stay away." The Guardian's Jordan Hoffman says it's worth one star out of five: "I hated Hot Tub Time Machine 2 so much I now can't even think about the first one without feeling annoyed. This may suggest that the only solution is to go and make a third one to rescue the franchise, but really it may be time to leave well enough alone." Due to a flimsy plot "where nothing is at stake, ... even the brilliant Robinson, whose every utterance gets at least a chuckle, can't save the movie. ... truly, there's nothing besides repeated use of swear words in lieu of wit." More: 'Hot Tub Time Machine 2' trailer goes back to the future (and beyond) New York Post's Kyle Smith notes, "Within five minutes you'll guess why Cusack, not overly encumbered with big film roles these days, didn't return for the sequel: The script is monotonous, meandering and witless, frantically ramming together middle-school non-ideas such as a guy being forced to rape another guy on a reality show, or a guy's testicles projectile-exploding into the faces of two other guys, or a guy being shot in both the head and the man-parts. ... The smart plotting of the first film is completely gone."
A grainy sonar image taken hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface may help unravel a mystery that has baffled historians for decades. What happened to aviator Amelia Earhart, and where's her plane? No one has been able to answer that question since 1937, when Earhart, navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra plane disappeared during a doomed attempt at an around-the-world flight. But information revealed by a team of researchers this week indicates they may have found a new clue. The sonar image was recorded by search teams scanning the ocean floor nearly a year ago near Nikumaroro Island, in the South Pacific. "It's the right size, it's the right shape, and it's in the right place," The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery said on its website. But it wasn't until March that one analyst made the connection in an online forum for the group. The organization says experts have offered different interpretations. Some think it could be a man-made object, and others say it could be a geologic feature. "So did (last summer's) expedition actually succeed in locating the wreckage of the world's most famous missing airplane? Or is this sonar target just a coral rock or ridge?" the organization said on its website. "Of course we're not going to know until we can get back out there, but until then the anomaly is worth close study." CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.
Canadian aviation company Bombardier is taking a "major bet" on the notoriously cut-throat passenger plane market, spending around $3.5 billion to compete with well-established rivals Boeing and Airbus, its chief executive Guy Hachey says. The money will be invested in Bombardier's new C Series aircraft, which has the capacity to seat 100 to 150 passengers. Bombardier faces obstacles, including the dominance of its competitors in the market and the eurozone financial crisis, which has hit the aviation industry hard. But the company is in a strong position to target a market that has been "under-served" by the major players, Hachey said. Watch: How to buy planes "So far, we've been serving customers up to about 100 seats, more in the regional segment. Now we're cracking into more of the mainline segment. We're investing about $3.5 billion -- for the size of our company that is a very significant investment," he told CNN. "If you look at our company we have two groups -- a group of about $10 billion on the rail side and $10 billion in aerospace. But it is a major bet for the corporation." Cutting edge design Hachey said Bombardier's competitive edge lies in the design of its planes. Until now, this market had largely been served by the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. However these smaller versions of planes -- called "shrinks" --- were also much heavier. The other option was Brazilian company Embraer's E-195 -- known as a "stretch" -- but it cannot fly as far in one go. In comparison, Hachey said Bombardier's C Series will deliver an "optimized product" built specifically for the 100 to 150-seat market. On its website the company says its aircraft will be lighter and more fuel efficient, yet provide a "best-in-class, wide-body cabin environment." Taking on the major players Bombardier's ambitions -- even with this new approach to design -- are high, given the long history of Airbus and Boeing in these markets. Founded in 1942, Bombardier is a relatively new kid on the aviation block. The company expanded from trains to planes in the 1980s and is now the third largest aircraft manufacturer. Its aerospace division now employs 33,600 people, with an annual turnover of Â£8.6 billion. According to Hachey, the company now has the scale to take such challenges. Watch: Three CEOs in a cockpit Hachey is hoping to capitalize on demand for around 7,000 aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat segment over the next 20 years. So far Bombardier has secured 330 commitments and 138 firm orders for its new aircraft. Hachey, who worked in the automotive industry for 30 years before moving to planes, said: "We feel very comfortable with the level of production we have going forwards, so we are very happy with our position." Beyond Europe As European markets continue to take a battering, Hachey says Bombardier will be expanding its focus elsewhere. In the past year the company has doubled its sales force in emerging countries, with a renewed push in the U.S. "In Europe typically things have been slower than usual, and this is a fortress market for us. We've been very strong in Europe so we are feeling the impact of the economic uncertainty," Hachey noted. Watch: Airlines brace for economic impact "The good thing is the rest of the world is not necessarily in the same shape. If you look at emerging countries we've been doing very well," he said. "We're focusing elsewhere. The U.S. has also been picking up which is a very, very important market for us." Sheena McKenzie contributed to this report
It's no secret that the Obama administration has been routinely using the war budget as a safety valve to pay for equipment and operations that have nothing to do with fighting wars. But as the President continues to expand U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria, it is important that this practice of using war funding to pay for unrelated items be brought to an end. The alternative -- allowing the Pentagon to use budgetary sleight of hand to evade the spending caps contained in current law -- is simply unacceptable. The levels of overfunding of the war budget -- known in Pentagon-ese as the Overseas Contingency Operations account -- have been astonishing. Independent analyses by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and the Project on Government Oversight suggest that there may be $20 to $30 billion in non-war-related expenditures in the $80 billion-plus OCO account in the 2014 budget alone. Two recent examples underscore how much excess funding has been sloshing around in the war budget. For a start, there is the fact that there is apparently enough money in the OCO account to pay for short-to-medium term expenses of the Obama administration's new war in Iraq and Syria. Yet every dollar in that account should have been justified based on the war in Afghanistan. This raises the question of what this money would have been spent on had the U.S. not become involved in countering ISIS. Second, there is talk of using the fund to buy eight additional F-35 fighter planes that won't even be ready for combat for a year or two. The next big budget battle will come with the Obama administration's proposal for Pentagon spending for FY 2016, which will be submitted to Congress next year. Independent experts have reportedly suggested that the Obama administration may ask for $15 to $20 billion in OCO spending for Iraq and Syria alone, plus whatever they assert is necessary to continue transitioning the U.S. mission in Afghanistan from direct combat against the Taliban to continued training of Afghan security forces. Congress should scrutinize this budget to make sure that every dime can be justified as having a specific connection to a current conflict, rather than a vaguely worded purpose that keeps the door open to continued use of the fund as a repository for Pentagon projects that couldn't cut it in the normal budgeting process. There are many reasons to question the wisdom of going to war in Iraq and Syria, but even members of Congress who currently support some sort of military action should be required to hold the line on unnecessary Pentagon outlays. And, as Congress casts a sharp eye on the administration's request for the war budget, it must also guard against the expansion of wasteful spending in the Pentagon's base budget. Advocates of higher Pentagon spending have seized on the crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine to argue for a lifting of the caps on Pentagon spending that currently exist. But given the levels of unnecessary spending that currently exist at the Pentagon, there is no need to lift the caps. A short list of items in the current Pentagon budget that need to be reduced before the department is allowed to request more funding should include the tens of billions spent on its vast civilian bureaucracy, the runaway funding for costly private contractors, vast overspending on basic items ranging from spare parts to prescription drugs, and unneeded and overpriced new combat systems like the F-35 and the new ballistic missile submarine. We shouldn't let the Pentagon use the conflict in Iraq and Syria to continue entrenched patterns of wasteful spending that add nothing to our national security. The ultimate proof that the Pentagon remains overfunded is the fact that it cannot manage a simple audit. The department can't even properly figure out how many contractors it has, what it is paying them, or what kinds and amounts of spare equipment and parts it has on hand. This sorry state of affairs is an invitation to fraud and abuse that is costing taxpayers untold billions every year. The last time the United States went to war, Pentagon spending was given a free pass that allowed it to grow to the highest levels since World War II with little accountability over how those funds were spent. As it considers next year's budget request, Congress has a responsibility to make the Pentagon justify every dollar of spending it is asking for. The alternative could be tens or even hundreds of billions in unnecessary expenditures in the years to come.
The French-Algerian football player stranded in Qatar for the past two years over a pay dispute has been given an exit permit to leave the country. "I cannot wait to go home," Zahiar Belounis, who has given up his claim to money he says he is owed, told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday. "I have waited for so long and now it has happened. I cannot believe it. "I am tired and stressed but now I am just looking forward to getting to the airport. "I want to see my family and get my life back to normal. I want to go home." During the long-running dispute Belounis, who had expected to receive his exit permit in October, says he has suffered with depression and revealed he had contemplated suicide. The 33-year-old will fly back to Paris on Thursday with his wife and two small daughters. In his only phone call to a media outlet immediately following the announcement, Belounis gave thanks to those who had fought for his cause so passionately. "I want to thank all those who believed me and gave me strength to get through," he told CNN. "I cannot believe how much support I've had. It has been amazing. "I just want to say thank you." Qatar has come under intense media scrutiny since winning the right to stage the 2022 World Cup, particularly over its employment laws -- notably the kafala system, which requires expatriate workers and some visitors to have a residence permit. The Belounis case has prompted the International Trade Union Confederation to demand a change to workers' rights in Qatar. "A grave injustice is nearly over for Zahir and his family. One man and his family have come to illustrate the conditions faced by 1.3 million migrant workers in Qatar," said Sharan Burrow, General Secretary, ITUC, in a statement. "The torment that Zahir and his family have been put through because of bad laws which give workers no rights should never be repeated. "Sadly, today in Qatar there remain many workers who have no voice. The Qatar authorities should reform their laws to respect International Labor Organization conditions." FIFPro, the global players union, is set to visit Qatar this week for talks with the country's football authorities and organizers of the 2022 World Cup. Representatives from the organization had been scheduled to meet with Belounis before the news of his exit visa was announced. "As the worldwide representative for professional footballers, FIFPro will be able to welcome back a long-lost family member," said FIFPro in a statement. "The World Footballers' Association would also like to express its gratitude to all who joined together with FIFPro to ensure a successful outcome." Neither the Qatari Foreign Ministiry nor the Qatari Football Association was not immediately available for comment, but in October the QFA told CNN that "as in any other football association in the world, there will unfortunately always be contractual disputes between clubs and players/coaches." It went on to add: "It is also relevant to emphasize that up to now the player has not taken any action in front of the competent judicial bodies of FIFA. "Our records show also that Zahir Belounis received salaries from one of our other affiliated clubs, Al Markhiya Club, when he played there during the second half of the 2011/12 season. "At the end of that season, Zahir Belounis contacted the QFA for outstanding salaries from Al Markhiya Club. The QFA immediately took action and, after analysis and investigation which gave him right, the player received full compensation. "However, in the alleged case of El Jaish Club, Zahir Belounis did not contact QFA, although he had experienced the efficiency of doing so when his request was legitimate." On Tuesday, FIFA President Sepp Blatter condemned European media for "attacking" and "criticizing" Qatar. "It is not fair when the international media and especially European media are taking up the focus of an Arab country here in Asia, and attacking, criticizing this country," Blatter said to delegates at the Asian Football Confederation awards in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. "We are defending it. We have taken the decision to play a World Cup in the Arab world and we have taken the decision to play in Qatar and we will go and play this ... in 2022 in Qatar," Blatter added. Earlier this month, the FIFA boss condemned working conditions in Qatar as "unacceptable" following an Amnesty International report which claimed migrant worker abuse was rife. "Economic and political leaders must contribute to improving the unacceptable situation in Qatar," Blatter said in a statement on November 21. "I am convinced that Qatar is taking the situation very seriously. These very discussions about Qatar show just what an important role football can play in generating publicity and thus bringing about change." Mahdi Belounis, the brother of Zahir, is now looking forward to meeting his brother at the airport and being reunited with his sibling. "This is fantastic news," he told CNN. "He wanted to say thank you to all the people who had shown him support on Twitter and Facebook. "This has been really traumatic for all of us -- for my mother and my disabled brother "We know he was depressed and that he was on medication and he had talked about suicide. We were really scared of some tragic news. "He should start from scratch. It's OK now."
A California fertility doctor implanted a dozen embryos in Nadya Suleman, resulting in "an unsafe octuplet delivery" last year, a lawyer for the state's medical board said Monday. Dr. Michael Kamrava, the fertility doctor who treated Suleman beginning in 1997, appeared before an administrative law judge Monday for a hearing that could lead to the loss of his medical license. Kamrava "will say she demanded all 12 embryos and, because it was the weekend, he did not know what to do," said California Deputy Attorney General Judith Alvarado. "But he knew it was unsafe." Suleman -- known in the media as "Octomom" -- was 33 years old when she gave birth to eight babies in January 2009. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava. She still has 29 frozen embryos in storage available for her use should she want more children, according to a witness who testified Monday. His lawyer argued that Kamrava has been "a respected, excellent physician and surgeon for 25 years," but that he "ran into sort of a perfect storm with one of his patients." Dr. Victor Fujimoto, an expert witness called by the medical board on Monday, testified that Suleman apparently asked Kamrava to implant a dozen embryos in July 2008. "As I understand, she requested it," Fujimoto said. When Alvarado asked him if it is not a doctor's responsibility to protect a patient from themselves, he answered "Sometimes." The Medical Board of California's complaint said the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies. "The whole series of contacts raise red flags with the stability of the patient herself and the overall intent of the patient," said Fujimoto. Kamrava was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine last year for what the fertility medical society called "a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards." The society recommends implanting no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40 -- who have more trouble getting pregnant -- according to guidelines published on its website. "Because of what's happened, he does now adhere strictly to these guidelines," defense lawyer Henry Fenton told the judge Monday. Fujimoto testified that Kamrava's implantation of 12 embryos in July 2008 was "gross negligence." "I cannot imagine any colleague of mine transferring that many," he said Giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies, including "complications with pregnancy, prematurity and long-term consequences of that." Suleman's children -- six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature -- all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. While there has been no indication any problems have emerged, "we still don't know," Fujimoto said. Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, California, is accused of gross negligence and repeated negligent acts in the treatment of a patient named in the medical board complaint only by her initials, N.S. Suleman has identified Kamrava as her doctor in interviews. He is also accused of negligence in another case in which a patient developed a "quadruplet pregnancy that was rocked with complications," according to the medical board.
Three of the top four vote-getters in Sunday's parliamentary elections in Greece will meet Tuesday at the presidential palace to form a coalition government, an official with the socialist party Pasok told CNN. The official spoke not for attribution because the talks were at a critical juncture. "As wide as possible cooperation ... should happen at the latest tomorrow evening," said Evangelos Venizelos, head of the Pasok Party, which placed third. The center-right New Democracy Party took first place in the vote. Its candidate, Antonis Samaras, has three days to cobble together a government. "There should be government of national salvation with as many parties as possible," Samaras told reporters. Democratic Party of the Left's leader, Fotis Kouvelis, held talks Monday that the New Democracy leader described as "constructive." The party's platform has supported the bailouts while seeking to renegotiate the terms. With almost all ballots counted, New Democracy had won nearly 30% of the vote, the Interior Ministry said. That gives the party 129 seats in the country's 300-seat parliament, forcing it to seek other coalition members from the fragmented field to form a majority. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the leftist Syriza party, which came in second, met with Samaras but said Monday he would not back a coalition. "History and the people will judge them by their results," Tsipras said of the parties backing the existing bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping Greece afloat. "Shortly we will be vindicated." What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? He said his party's nearly 27% showing had forced Greek leaders to realize the bailout is "nonviable," and said Syriza would press as a member of the opposition for the bailouts to be scrapped. An official with Syriza told CNN that no one from the party was planning to attend the meeting. Syriza, which campaigned against the terms of the bailout, got 71 seats. Pasok, which long dominated Greek politics, won 33. Four smaller parties took fewer than two dozen seats each. The vote was widely seen as a referendum on whether Greece should remain in the euro, the currency used by 325 million people across 17 countries in Europe. The possibility of a "no" vote roiled world markets, with some analysts warning that the collapse of the euro would cost $1 trillion. Asian markets reacted positively to the election results, while European and U.S. markets were mixed. Samaras said he would build a government of "parties that believe in the nation's European orientation, that believe in the euro." But he acknowledged that government budget cuts forced on the country by international lenders have caused suffering among Greeks. A wild election weekend for Greece, France and Egypt The new government will have to make changes "in order for the Greek people to escape the torturous reality of unemployment and unbelievable difficulties that every Greek family faces today," Samaras said after meeting with the president. He faces a new round of coalition talks, six weeks after a previous election that failed to produce a government. International bailouts have kept Greece from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue, but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange. Eurozone finance ministers praised the election results, "which should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring Greece back on a path of sustainable growth." Some observers had predicted that efforts to renegotiate the bailout could lead to a run on Greek banks and deeper misery. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios "Don't underestimate the capacity of the Greek people to rise to the occasion," Petros Doukas, a former New Democracy lawmaker and deputy finance minister, told CNN. "What's very clear is the Greeks today voted, including those that voted for Syriza, in favor of the euro and the European Union," Doukas said. He predicted that Greece could negotiate better terms with its creditors, who understand "that you can only squeeze so much so fast out of a country and out of its people." Greeks have been suffering under painful austerity measures, high unemployment and a long-running recession. The country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered compliant with the terms of its bailout. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's powerful advocate for balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth, had urged Greeks not to walk away from the international loan deals. "We will stick to the agreements. That is the basis on which Europe will prosper," she said Saturday. As economic crisis bites, Greece's children pay the price CNN's Penny Manis, Christine Theodorou, Lonzo Cook, Richard Quest, Matthew Chance, Irene Chapple, John Defterios and Diana Magnay contributed to this report.
Alaska's Inuit Eskimos and environmentalists -- say an oil spill could pollute the waters and damage the economy. "Our subsistence for the winter, it all comes from the ocean, the fish and whale. It's going to ruin our ocean," 79-year-old Abagail Nashupuq of Point Hope told CNN recently. Nashupuq has spent her entire life in the small northwest fishing village of Point Hope, which sits about 90 miles from where Shell plans to drill one of its exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea. Shell has been forced to postpone drilling, which was scheduled to begin this month, until August by an unexpected thick ice pack. The delay cuts valuable time from Shell, which is operating under U.S. permits which require to stop drilling in the seas by the end of October. Questions also were raised in June about the durability of one of Shell's underwater oil spill containment vessels in severe weather, which resulted in the vessel that was headed to one of the drilling sites to be temporarily held at port in Washington. Opponents, primarily the Inuit and environmentalists, called for a review of the federal air permits that were issued to Shell Oil as part of its drilling plan. Related story: Nations battle for Arctic oil and natural gas Greenpeace, which has been leading a campaign against the drilling, issued a statement Sunday that questioned whether Shell could carry out the complicated plan if it was having problems with a ship's mooring. Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said all indications pointed to the Noble Discoverer slipping anchor in soft ground, drifting only 100 yards toward shore. "Shell quickly engaged one of its support vessels, the Lauren Foss, which safely towed the Discoverer back to its previous location," he said. Francis, the petty officer, said the crew of the Noble Discoverer were interviewed. "They did not feel any indication that the ship grounded," she said. The Coast Guard plans an inspection of the interior of the ship's hull on Monday, the same day that Shell will use a diver to conduct a secondary inspection of the outer hull. Smith said the anchor system used in the Arctic offshore drilling is "no way similar to the light anchor used in the harbor scenario." Still, Slaiby promised a full investigation. "Even a near miss is unacceptable.  While an internal investigation will determine why the Discoverer slipped anchor, we are pleased with the speed and effectiveness of the mitigation measures we had in place," he said.
Despite the recent recall of potentially contaminated Romaine, lettuce lovers don't have to nix key ingredients from their BLTs or face lifeless, leafless salads -- they just need to go to seed. Food-borne illness has been tied to E. coli 0145 found in commercially-grown lettuce sold to wholesalers, food service outlets and some in-store salad bars and delis. Lettuce E. coli outbreak spreads to fourth state Not only can at-home growers skip this risk -- they'll also save money, enjoy a nearly endless variety of organic and heirloom options and have fresh salads at their fingertips all year around -- even without an outdoor garden. Restaurants assure customers lettuce is safe amid recall Supplies you need: Seeds Lettuce grows in several major formats: loose leaf (like Lolla Rossa and Black Seeded Simpson), crisphead (Iceberg and Great Lakes), butterhead (Bibb and Buttercrunch), Cos (also called Romaine) and stem (mostly used in Chinese cooking). For small container gardens and windowboxes, loose leaf is a solid bet, as it grows quickly and doesn't need to establish deep roots. Most hardware, garden and variety stores carry a range of popular seed varieties -- often for $1 or less -- but adventurous gardeners may wish to explore colorful, flavor-packed heirloom and certified organic single-seed packets and blends from online retailers. The Seed Savers Exchange and D. Landreth stock dozens, from blazing Mascara to deep, dark Red Velvet. Containers Just about any will do, from store bought terracotta pots and plastic window boxes to take-out containers, foil pie pans, halved two-liter bottles and emptied-out plastic clamshells from the supermarket. The vessel just needs to be food-safe, several inches deep and perforated at the bottom to allow drainage. Starting head lettuce in peat pots inside containers allows the option for transplant into a larger garden space -- or even sharing the bounty with friends. Picture yourself: Cool gardens Soil If it's going into the food, it's going into you. If possible, opt for chemical-free or organic potting soil -- increasingly available at major hardware stores and home centers. Lighting Lightly shaded outdoor areas are ideal, as tender young leaves are susceptible to burning in bright sunlight, but windowboxes and kitchen counters can also produce surprisingly robust crops. If natural light isn't available, cool white bulbs and fluorescent lights can successfully stimulate vegetative growth. The seedlings need about 12 hours of light a day, and gardeners may need to adjust the distance from bulb to soil to figure out what works best in their home. You will also need a spray bottle and some plastic wrap. Instructions: Place at least 2 inches of moist, lightly-packed potting soil into a container with drainage holes. Sprinkle a sparse layer of seeds on top of the soil and follow that with a very light dusting of soil. Mist the soil with a few pumps from a water bottle, lightly cover the container with plastic wrap and place in a warm, bright spot. The seedlings should germinate in about five days. Once they have, remove the plastic wrap and keep the container in the light for around 12 hours a day. Keep the soil moist with the spray bottle or gentle watering from a can or cup. Make sure the soil is draining and not pooling at the bottom of the container. Most crops will be ready to harvest and enjoy within three to four weeks for leaf varieties, and longer for more robust heads. Just snip leaves directly into a colander, rinse and enjoy the fruits -- and vegetables -- of your labor.
The United States will not bargain with al Qaeda over the life of an American worker filmed making an emotional plea to President Barack Obama to save his life, U.S. officials said Monday. "We don't make concessions to terrorists," State Department spokesman Mark Toner said when asked whether the United States would meet the demands contained in a video posted Sunday to several Islamist websites featuring Warren Weinstein. "My life is in your hands, Mr. President," said the American captured in August from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore. "If you accept the demands, I live. If you don't accept the demands, then I die." White House spokesman Jay Carney reiterated the point, saying that while the administration's hearts go out to Weinstein and his family, "we cannot and will not negotiate with al Qaeda." Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al Qaeda terror network, listed eight demands that he said, if met, would result in Weinstein's release. The demands related to issues in the Middle East, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia. "It is important that you accept these demands and act quickly and don't delay," Weinstein said in the video posted Sunday. Toner said that U.S. officials had not corroborated the video and could not say with certainty that the man in the video is Weinstein. He said he believes Weinstein is likely being held in the tribal areas of Pakistan, but that the United States has no way to verify it. The State Department said Monday that U.S. officials, including the FBI, are assisting Pakistani authorities in the investigation. Toner said Monday that the government is staying in close contact with Weinstein's family. In the video, which is less than three minutes long, Weinstein makes references to Obama's daughters and to his own children; he says he wants to let his wife know he is "fine and well." Al Qaeda's demands include the lifting of the blockade on movement of people and trade between Egypt and Gaza; an end to bombing by the United States and its allies in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and Gaza; the release of anyone arrested on charges of belonging to al Qaeda and the Taliban. It also calls for the release of all prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and American secret prisons and the closure of Guantanamo and the other prisons. The group also wants the release of terrorists convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the release of relatives of Osama bin Laden, the founder of al Qaeda who was killed last year in Pakistan. Weinstein was captured after his kidnappers managed to overcome the three security guards who were protecting him. As the guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan, according to the Lahore police. Once the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in while five others entered the house from the back, tied up the guards and duct-taped their mouths, according to the police. They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room, where they also hit Weinstein on the head with a pistol and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, the police said. A police official said in August that three suspects had been arrested in Weinstein's kidnapping. Weinstein was working for J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia. CNN's Elise Labott and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.
Coulomb Technologies on Wednesday said it will build 4,600 electric vehicle charging stations in nine regions of the U.S., funded by $37 million in grants. More than half of the charging stations in the program called ChargePoint America will go in public locations, such as overnight parking spaces, offices, or retail locations. About 2,000 going into people's homes as part of the purchase of an electric vehicle. The goal of the charging network and others like it is to make electric vehicles more accessible to consumers, as these cars come to market in the coming months, said Richard Lowenthal, the CEO of Campbell, California-based Coulomb Technologies during a press conference. The program differs from other electric vehicle charging networks in that Coulomb is working with Ford Motor, General Motors, and Smart USA on the roll out, Lowenthal said. Ford will release an electric Transit Connect utility van and electric Ford Focus sedan in 2011, GM plans to release the Volt by November, and the electric Smart fortwo will begin pilot testing in the U.S. by 2011. The stations themselves will be equipped with 220-volt service at either 16 or 30 amps, which enables faster charging than regular home electrical service. Lowenthal said that an electric car with a large battery could charge from empty in under four hours. Drivers will be able to find available charging stations using either an iPhone or Blackberry application, which can also send alerts if a car battery is running low or if a connected car is unplugged. The system includes software for station owners to set billing rates. Regions are considering cheaper off-peak rates to encourage drivers to charge overnight. Utilities can see available energy electric vehicles or run demand-response programs to slow charging rates during peak times if needed. "Our stations are unique in that they are all networked. That allows them to support a bunch of software applications which are important to different constituents," Lownenthal said, adding that installation will begin immediately and continue for 18 months. The nine regions are: the Bellevue and Redmond, Washington area; Sacramento, Calif.; the San Francisco and San Jose, California. region; Los Angeles; Orlando, Florida; Washington D.C.; New York City; Austin, Texas; and Detroit, Michigan. Of the total in grants, $15 million will come from the Department of Energy as part of the stimulus act and another $22 million will come from other sources, Lowenthal said. As part of project, Coulomb will gather data on driver usage patterns and report it to the Department of Energy until October 2013. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

A Black Hawk helicopter crashed Thursday in southern Afghanistan, likely killing all four of its crew members -- all of them Americans -- a U.S. military official said. The crash occurred in bad weather, though the official said, "We cannot yet rule out enemy action." Troops at a combat outpost in the area waiting to be picked up saw the crash happen, the official said. Another helicopter flying nearby was not affected. Fatal helicopter crashes involving members of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force are not unprecedented in Afghanistan, with some of the aircraft brought down by enemy fire while others crashed for mechanical reasons. The single deadliest loss for U.S. troops since the Afghan war began in late 2001 happened in August, when 30 U.S. service members died when a helicopter carrying them went down while they were reinforcing other troops, officials said. Seven Afghan troops died in that same crash. A U.S. military official said then that insurgents were believed to have shot down the CH-47 Chinook. The Taliban claimed that militants downed the helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. More recently, 12 people died last month when a helicopter crashed last month in Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul. Capt. David Yaryar, an ISAF spokesman, said there was no reported "insurgent activity in the area" at the time.
She says she didn't want to do it, but was convinced by a teacher's aide to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator. What happened next was horrific: The then-14-year-old girl says she was sodomized by a fellow student in a school bathroom. Now 19, she is telling her story publicly for the very first time. "I just felt like I was set up by the teachers. They gave me a word that they couldn't keep," said the woman, who asked CNN to call her "Jaden." According to court records, a 16-year-old student approached Jaden in the hallway of Sparkman Middle School in Toney, Alabama, on January 22, 2010, and asked her to meet him in a bathroom for sex. It was not the first time the boy had propositioned her, said Jaden, who was enrolled in the school's special education program. Usually, she just ignored him. But, on that day, Jaden told a friend, who suggested she tell a teacher's aide about what was happening. That aide, June Ann Simpson, knew of other girls who the boy had tried to lure into a bathroom for sex, according to a 2010 federal lawsuit filed by Jaden's father against Madison County Schools and officials. Simpson, in turn, told the school's principal, Ronnie Blair, about the allegations. According to a 2012 deposition, Blair told Simpson the boy would have to be proven guilty to be punished. In response, Simpson crafted a plan to prove the allegations, using Jaden as bait. The idea was to have the girl agree to meet the boy in a bathroom. Simpson would watch surveillance video, and teachers would intervene before anything happened. "I told her no. I didn't want to do it," Jaden told CNN. She acquiesced later that day. "I just wanted it to stop," Jaden said about the alleged harassment. 'He just gets away with it' Key questions in her case center around who knew what and when. Jaden and Simpson claim they then went to the office of vice-principal Jeanne Dunaway. However, Simpson says when she told Dunaway about the plan, Dunaway did not respond. During a deposition, Dunaway denied the conversation happened. Jaden says she then left Dunaway's office and found the boy in the hallway to tell him they could "do it." Simpson stayed behind to watch surveillance monitors, hoping to catch the two walk into the bathroom. She never did. According to Jaden's written statement after the incident, the boy made a last-minute change. Instead of meeting in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor, the boy allegedly told the girl to meet him in the sixth grade boys' bathroom, in another part of the school. Once there, Jaden says she tried to stall the boy, hoping a teacher would rush in. She told him she didn't want to have sex, and she tried blocking him, according to her 2012 deposition. Nothing worked. Jaden says the boy sodomized her. "I thought they were going to do what they said they were going to do -- and be there and stop him -- just get him in trouble," Jaden told CNN. The alleged attacker was never charged and the case was never presented to a grand jury, according to Madison County District Attorney Robert Broussard. The incident was characterized as "inappropriate (sic) touching a girl in boys bathroom" according to school disciplinary records. The boy was suspended from school for five days and sent to an alternative school for a short time. The alleged attack was at least the 13th incident of sexual or violent misconduct in the boy's file, all within two academic years. While at the alternative school, the boy was suspended for sharing pornographic images on a cell phone. He was eventually allowed to return to Sparkman Middle School while Jaden was still enrolled as a student. "He just gets away with it, I guess," she told CNN. June Ann Simpson resigned shortly after the incident. "My client has gone from being a teacher's aide to being a scapegoat," Simpson's attorney, McGriff Belser III told CNN. Dunaway is now the principal at nearby Madison County Elementary School. 'Hard for me to have good days' In 2013, a district court judge allowed the father's claims of state violations, including negligence, against Simpson and Dunaway. The judge tossed out the federal claims -- that the school district violated Title IX and that Simpson and school administrators deprived the girl of her civil rights. Title IX is a federal law aimed at ending sexual discrimination in education. In part, it dictates how schools that receive federal funds must respond to claims of sexual harassment. Both sides have appealed. "(Judge T. Michael Putnam) found the board of education's policies were proper. He found that the school administrators took appropriate action and complied completely with federal law as soon as they were notified of this unfortunate incident," attorney Mark Boardman told reporters last month. Boardman's firm represents Madison County Schools and the administrators named in the 2010 lawsuit. The firm has not responded to CNN's numerous calls for an interview. Also in September, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division submitted a 126-page strident amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, disagreeing with the district judge's order. The brief, submitted jointly with the U.S. Department of Education, argues the school, in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is "liable for (its) deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment." "If Title IX imposes any responsibility on school officials to prevent sexual harassment, it surely requires a response when they learn, as here, that a 14-year-old special needs student is about to be used as bait to catch a 16-year-old student with an extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct," federal attorneys write in the brief. On the same day the federal brief was submitted, the Women's Law Project, joined by 32 national and local organizations, submitted a joint brief supporting the family's lawsuit. The National Women's Law Center and the family's attorney, Eric Artrip, have also submitted a joint brief to the Eleventh Circuit. "It means a lot. It says that people actually care about what happens," Jaden told CNN Months after the incident, the teen transferred to a school district out of state, but eventually dropped out of school before graduating. Jaden says she continues to struggle. "It's hard for me to have good days," she told CNN. "I have days to where I just want to sit there by myself. I get angry faster, and I get insecure." Asked what might help her, she stressed the importance of justice and closure. "By actually having our day in court, and letting everything be known, so that it won't happen again," Jaden said. CNN's Stephanie Gallman and Dana Ford contributed to this report from Atlanta.
Picture a mansion on an estate that, before the Civil War, was a thriving Southern cotton plantation. Entering the lavish home is a tall, lanky, bearded man wearing a suit and a stovepipe hat. Sound familiar? Next, another man dressed as Abraham Lincoln arrives -- also tall and bearded -- with the same hat. Then a third. And a fourth. Yep, what we have here is an honest-to-goodness convention of Lincoln lookalikes. Photographer T.J. Kirkpatrick documented this annual meeting of the Association of Lincoln Presenters in April. His images remind us how iconic the 16th President of the United States continues to be, 149 years after his assassination. "It was certainly quirky," said Kirkpatrick, who especially enjoyed reactions the Lincolns would get in public by people who weren't part of the group. "They'd be surprised to see one Lincoln. Then, once they realized there were 20 more of them, it was like, 'Oh my God!' " The Lincolns were joined by other lookalikes of the same era, including women dressed as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, complete with petticoats and huge, colorful gowns. After arriving at the mansion at Lansdowne Plantation in Natchez, Mississippi, some of the Lincolns unbuttoned their long suit coats and sat down for dinner. Kirkpatrick photographed the group at the dining room table. "A lot of the conversation was just them catching up about their kids and grandkids," Kirkpatrick said. "There was this air of history hanging over the conversation because of the setting -- and because of their costumes." Actually, Kirkpatrick gets paid to photograph the real President of the United States. As a photojournalist with White House credentials, he regularly takes news assignments that put him in the Oval Office just a few feet from President Barack Obama. Kirkpatrick's trip down south was part of a larger project surrounding conventions in general. "The idea is to look at people sort of gathering around their interests," he explained. "When they come together -- when they kind of join their flock -- I find a certain honesty in those moments. I hope the pictures that I'm making reveal the community they're creating around this particular interest." Kirkpatrick has photographed plenty of Civil War battle re-enactments. You might say the Lincoln convention is a geekier kind of re-enactment -- for political history buffs. "By and large they take their roles fairly seriously," he said. "In general, everybody was in their suit and top hat for four days." That's commitment. In one of Kirkpatrick's favorite images from the shoot, an "Abe" steals a kiss from a "Mary" outside a hotel ballroom. "It's a very human moment -- a very honest interaction between husband and wife," he said. "And it happens to be that they're dressed as these historical characters." The convention came with jarring visual anachronisms. For example, it was impossible to ignore the sight of Abe Lincoln on a cell phone. And two Lincolns using digital cameras to snap photos of each other isn't something you see every day. The convention also provoked stark observations. In fact, the irony of an ex-slave plantation hosting an event honoring the man who freed America's slaves wasn't lost on Kirkpatrick. "They had a little patch of cotton on the property where people who go on tours can actually pick cotton," Kirkpatrick said. Some of the re-enactors decided to try it. "It was weird seeing a bunch of Lincolns gathered around picking cotton," he said. Also during the plantation tour, one conventioneer -- portraying African-American abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass -- commented about the trees in the area. "I wonder if anyone was ever hung from these branches. These trees could tell some stories," Kirkpatrick recalled the man saying. The comment, Kirkpatrick said, "gave a broader context to this gathering -- that there was so much history that gets ignored or brushed under the table when we see a person portraying Lincoln ... or we go to a Civil War re-enactment. It's a very thin slice of the reality of those people's lives at that time." "It wasn't a morbid observation, I think it was a very honest one," Kirkpatrick said. "There's a lot that we don't know, that doesn't get talked about -- certainly from that time period -- that should be. T.J.

Ben Affleck's C.I.A. thriller "Argo" is having quite the box office run. After debuting at number two with $19.5 million, Warner Bros.' Oscar contender dropped by just 16 percent last weekend to $16.4 million. This weekend, the film notched yet another impressive achievement: it climbed to number one with an estimated $12.4 million (a 25 percent drop) in its third frame, becoming the first film since "True Grit" to hop to first place in its third weekend. "Argo," which cost $45 million to make, has now earned $60.8 million total, and thanks to terrific word-of-mouth (the film earned an "A+" CinemaScore grade) and early awards buzz, Argo is eyeing a $100 million finish. Though it is running a tad behind Affleck's last directorial effort, The Town, which had earned $64.1 million at the same point in its run en route to a $92.2 million finish, Argo is enjoying much better week-to-week holds. ("The Town," which opened higher "Argo" with $23.8 million, fell 38 percent to $9.7 million in its third weekend.) Sony Pictures Animation's $85 million Adam Sandler-voiced effort "Hotel Transylvania" jumped two spots into second place with $9.5 million in its fifth weekend. The film, which has scored slim drops since its robust $42.5 million debut in September, only fell 27 percent this weekend — the final frame before "Halloween." It will be interesting to see whether Hotel holds up in the holiday's wake, but it's already a monster hit. With $130.4 million total, Hotel is already Sony Pictures Animation's highest grossing film ever, above Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, which grossed $124.9 million in 2009. It's also given Adam Sandler a much-needed career boost following his back-to-back misfires, Jack and Jill and That's My Boy. The pricey novel adaptation "Cloud Atlas" finished in third place with a weak $9.4 million. Remarkably, that was the best start of any of this weekend's newcomers, which is a testament to the weakness of the frame. The heady drama, which follows six separate storylines and stars Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Hugh Grant in various roles, genders, and races, proved too difficult for mainstream audiences to latch onto. Audiences, which were 77 percent above the age of 25, issued the film a "C+" CinemaScore. For Warner Bros., "Cloud Atlas' "failure is not the worst news — the studio acquired domestic distribution rights for a reported $15 million and marketed the film — but the real losers here are the Wachowski siblings and the foreign investors who financed the project. "Cloud Atlas" cost a whopping $100 million, and it has no chance of making that money back — at least not in the States. Another loser? Tom Hanks, whose box office clout has all but disappeared in recent years. Cloud Atlas arrives on the heels of two other box office underperformers: "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" ($31.9 million) and "Larry Crowne" ($35.6 million). In fourth, "Paranormal Activity 4" dropped by a massive 70 percent — a high point for the Paranormal franchise (PA2 dropped by 60 percent in its second weekend. PA3 fell 65 percent) — to $8.7 million. After ten days, Paramount's $5 million found footage sequel has earned $42.6 million, which is still $10 million less than PA3 grossed in its first weekend. "Taken 2" took fifth place, sliding 40 percent to $8.0 million, which gives Fox's $45 million action thriller a $117.4 million total. Though the Liam Neeson vehicle is a huge hit, it's becoming clear that it will not surpass the final $145 million domestic gross of the original "Taken." In its fourth weekend, "Taken," which opened with half of what Taken 2 made, earned $11.3 million. "Taken 2" is falling much faster. 1. Argo -- $12.4 million 2. Hotel Transylvania -- $9.5 million 3. Cloud Atlas -- $9.4 million 4. Paranormal Activity 4 -- $8.7 million 5. Taken 2 -- $8.0 million Outside the Top 5, three new wide releases all performed embarrassingly. Open Road's $20 million videogame adaptation/horror sequel "Silent Hill: Revelation 3D" started in sixth place with $8.0 million. The original "Silent Hill" surprised analysts with a strong $20.2 million debut in 2006, but it clearly didn't leave enough of an impression on audiences for them to show up for a sequel six years later. Crowds gave the film an uninspiring "C" CinemaScore. Two other films did even worse. Paramount's surprisingly edgy Victoria Justice vehicle "Fun Size" grossed $4.1 million from 3,014 theaters. The $14 million film garnered a "B" CinemaScore grade from crowds, which were 67 percent female and 61 percent below the age of 18. Gerard Butler's new surfing drama "Chasing Mavericks," meanwhile, tanked in twelfth place with $2.2 million from 2,006 theaters, giving it a $1,099 per theater average. Audiences issued the film a "B+" CinemaScore. Internationally, "Skyfall," the 23rd picture in the James Bond series, got off to a massive start. The film grossed $77.7 million from 25 territories, including $32.4 million from the U.K. (where the film set a new attendance record on Saturday), $9.1 million from France, and $8.6 million from Russia. According to Sony, Skyfall's start was 76 percent bigger than the launch of Casino Royale, and 30 percent bigger than Quantum of Solace's debut. The film opens stateside on Nov. 9.

Bayer Leverkusen moved to within three points of German Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich after a comfortable 4-2 home victory over Hamburg on Sunday. A double from Stefan Kiessling helped Leverkusen on their way to another three points, leaving them clear in third, a point behind second-placed Schalke, with the top three now pulling away in the race for the title with just eight games left. Kiessling opened the scoring after running onto Tranquillo Barnetta's through-ball and out-pacing two defenders before firing past goalkeeper Frank Rost. But Ze Roberto volleyed home a 33rd-minute equalizer for Hamburg after a defensive mix-up involving Sami Hyppia and goalkeeper Rene Adler. Eren Derdiyok restored Leverkusen's lead in the 55th-minute when heading home Daniel Schwaab's ball into the box -- and Kiessling quickly added a third with a simple tap-in after some great work from Renato Augusto. Czech defender David Rozehnal gave Hamburg some brief hope when converting an 83rd minute Piotr Trochowski free-kick but the victory was confirmed just a minute later when Gonzalo Casto fired home from just inside the area. Meanwhile, in the day's other match, Claudio Pizarro scored his 11th league goal of the season to give Werder Bremen a 1-0 home win over Hoffenheim. The Peruvian striker lobbed goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand with just nine minutes remaining to leave Werder sixth in the table, one point away from a place in Europe.
Now it begins. All over again. The primary season over and the nominating conventions complete, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama hit the ground running Friday for the final stretch of a campaign that began, for Romney at least, more than a year ago in Iowa. Over the next 60 days of campaigning, much of it focusing on key battleground states, the two men will pitch their visions for the country to a divided electorate. They spent Friday in two states that have long figured prominently in presidential elections, and which are considered up for grabs this year: Iowa and New Hampshire. President Obama, fresh off his speech Thursday night accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, began his day with a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with Vice President Joe Biden and their wives. Meanwhile, Republican challenger Romney addressed supporters in Orange City, Iowa. Five things we learned from Day Three of the DNC Later, the candidates swapped states -- with Obama and Biden traveling to Iowa City for an event at the University of Iowa while Romney spoke to supporters in Nashua, New Hampshire. While many of their speeches echoed remarks they've made in recent weeks, including at their respective national conventions, one new and hot topic Friday -- especially for Republicans -- was a worse-than-expected jobs report issued by the Department of Labor. While unemployment fell to 8.1% in August from 8.3% the month before, the dip was largely the result of fewer people looking for work, an analysis of the data showed. The economy added 96,000 jobs in August, but that's down from 141,000 the month before. Economists polled by CNNMoney had predicted 120,000 new jobs in August. Speaking to reporters Friday in Sioux City, Iowa, Romney called the latest report "very disappointing," stating that for "every net new job created, approximately four people dropped out of the workforce." "After the party last night, the hangover today," Romney said, referring to Thursday's Democratic National Convention. The former Massachusetts governor also played up the jobs report at his public rallies Friday, vowing to overturn Obama's signature health plan and institute a number of new policies that he says will energize the economy. "This economy is going to come back in a big way ... but it is going to require me being elected president," Romney said in Nashua, eliciting a roar from the supportive crowd. Obama fired back in his Portsmouth appearance, stressing the positive news that businesses had created jobs for the 30th straight month. But he ackowledged the pace was insufficient. "We know it's not good enough. We need to create more jobs, faster," the president said. And as he did during his speech Thursday night in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama specified several economic-related pledges and said it could take years for the economy to be back at full steam. But any progress thus far will be for naught, and everyday Americans will be sold out, if Romney wins the election, he said. Jobs report brings end to Democrats' convention high "If you turn away now -- if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn't possible -- well, change will not happen," he said in his speech. He said voters will have "a choice between two different paths for America, a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future." In response, Romney said Obama was offering more of the same policies he said have led to high unemployment, rising deficits and a slow economic recovery. "Americans will hold President Obama accountable for his record -- they know they're not better off and that it's time to change direction," the Romney campaign said in a statement. In Iowa, he reiterated the charge, and said Obama's acceptance speech highlighted his opponent's shortcomings. "There was nothing in the speech that gives confidence that the president knows what he is doing when it comes to jobs and the economy," Romney said. In the latest CNN/ORC International poll -- conducted before the Democratic convention -- Obama and Romney were tied. In the poll of 1,005 likely voters, 48% said they would support Romney and an identical number backed Obama. About 2% said they favored neither candidate, and 1% had no opinion. Breaking down Obama's speech CNN's Tom Cohen and Kevin Liptak and CNNMoney's Steve Hargreaves contributed to this report.
Sony's big Wednesday event in New York for the new PlayStation 4 was streamed live online around the world -- filled with gameplay, tech talk and a display of new features. Curious gamers watched, flocking to Twitter and other social sites to share their thoughts. Perhaps ironically, not everyone was a fan of the PS4's ability to share via social sites. Lead system architect Mark Cerny outlined a menu of new social features built in to the PS4 such as sharing gameplay with friends, being connected through existing social networks and monitoring what you play and what you purchase. "Why does Sony think we want to tell everyone about what games we're playing?" Andrew Meskill wrote on Twitter. "I want to sit in a dark room on my own with a pad." In the gaming world, some said, sharing isn't always a plus. "I would much rather figure out how to beat the game myself rather than have someone complete it for me," Chris Jarvis tweeted. And in the social age, whenever there's talk of sharing, inevitably the discussion turns to privacy concerns. "'This system is very aware of the player and whatever is going on in the room at any given point," tweeted Jason Evangelho, a tech contributor for Forbes. "I DO NOT want this, do you?" But Dennis Fong, CEO of gaming-oriented social site Raptr, told CNN he thinks the social sharing feature built in to the PS4 is exactly what next-generation devices should be doing. "The ability to capture an image, video, or instantly broadcast what's on your screen to your friends is transformational for the new generation of consoles," Fong said. "Providing players community tools to create content for your game in the form of videos and live broadcasts is not simply a cool feature for gamers but also great for business. User-generated content keeps players engaged with the game even while they aren't playing it and also attracts new users from the buzz generated around this content." But features aside, a gaming system is only as good as its games. That theme started early in the day when gamers on Twitter created the trending hashtag #PlayStationMemories. Many used it to recall fondly playing classic titles such as "Crash Bandicoot" or "Spyro the Dragon" on the original PlayStation console. Sony showed off how powerful the PS4 will be with in-game footage and demos from a handful of new titles, including updates to the "Killzone" and "InFamous" franchises. Their visuals and gameplay demos induced a lot of digital drooling. "The pre-release video of 'Killzone 2' convinced me to get a PS3. 'Killzone 4' might've just done the same for the #PS4. Outstanding!" Jon Lomas wrote about the demo for "Killzone: Shadow Fall." Even brand new games, such as "Deep Down" from Capcom, drew praise despite not showing any in-game footage. Lauren Anne liked what she saw when a dragon appeared on screen. "Oh yes! Deep Down is going to be my top purchase for PS4!" she tweeted. "Dragons and gorgeous graphics are win-win for me!" But the snark Twitter is famous for was evident during the rollout of "InFamous: Second Son," a game set in a dystopian future where cameras monitor your every move. "Ironically, this game is coming out on a system that will track & broadcast every damn thing you do or play or buy," wrote Game Informer senior features editor Matt Helgeson. Some folks didn't like that while tons of details were rolled out, the PlayStation 4 console wasn't displayed Wednesday. "#2HoursIllNeverGetBack," tweeted one user in the site's hashtag-as-punchline style. Richard Preston went with a more established Internet catchphrase. "Pic or it didn't happen," he wrote. In the end, most who paid attention seemed impressed with what they saw. But not all were ready to hand Sony the console-wars victory. "#PS4 looking nice, but can't wait to see what #Microsoft has," wrote one user. "The ball is in your court now." Many gaming insiders predict that Microsoft will show off its new console -- possibly the Xbox 720 -- at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June. That would likely mean new consoles from the two rivals both will hit the market in time for the holidays.
Goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Kevin-Prince Boateng earned reigning Serie A champions AC Milan a 2-1 victory over local rivals Internazionale in the Italian Super Cup played at the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing on Saturday. Wesley Sneijder put Inter ahead after 22 minutes with a curling free-kick past Milan's 'keeper Christian Abbiati, before former Inter striker, Ibrahimovic headed home an equalizer from close range in the 60th minute. Milan's winner came just nine minutes later, as Ghanaian international, Boateng reacted quickest after substitute Alexandre Pato's shot deflected off the post. Van der Sar says farewell Inter, now coached by Gian Piero Gasperini, pressed in vain for an equalizer but couldn't stop their great rivals lifting the trophy for a sixth time. AC Milan begin the defense of their Serie A title on 27 August, away to Cagliari. Inter, last season's runners-up, kick off their Serie A campaign the following day against Lecce.
WCBS news anchor Rob Morrison is facing charges of allegedly choking his wife, CBS MoneyWatch anchor Ashley Morrison, according to Connecticut authorities. Rob Morrison was taken into custody early Sunday at the couple's Darien home when police responded to a "domestic violence incident" called in by Ashley Morrison's mother, according to a statement from the Darien Police Department. He was arrested and accused of choking his wife with both hands after becoming "increasingly belligerent...during the course of the evening," the statement said. Officers observed red marks on Ashley Morrison's neck, but she did not request medical treatment, according to the police department release. While being processed, Rob Morrison made verbal threats to further harm his wife, according to the police statement. In a joint statement released Monday, the couple's attorney, Robert Skovgaard, said, "Rob and Ashley Morrison are cooperating fully with the authorities to insure that all of the information necessary to properly evaluate this unfortunate incident is made available." "The Morrisons are confident that a full review of this matter will show that the allegations have been greatly exaggerated." WCBS spokeswoman Rachel Ferguson said because this is a personal matter, the station is declining to comment. Morrison is scheduled to be in court Tuesday on charges of second-degree strangulation, second-degree threatening and disorderly conduct.
star of the team which won three European Cupss in the mid-Seventies --  and former president Wilhelm Neudecker as Bayern's only honorary presidents. "His efforts were pioneering during an extremely difficult time for FC Bayern," Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge recalled in 2009. "He experienced things which so many people unfortunately experienced in those times. We must do everything necessary to prevent times like that happening ever again. "Remembrance is a vital component in that." In Britain, a former prisoner of war, Ron Jones, has also detailed his painful memories of football under the Nazi regime in a new memoir. The 96-year-old recounts his experiences in the Auschwitz death camp where he and fellow British soldiers formed a football team. His story has been published in a 2013 book called The Auschwitz Goalkeeper.
Any way you slice it, thousands of same-sex couples across the United States were thrilled by Wednesday's Supreme Court rulings. But in 37 states, some same-sex couples weren't as happy as they'd hoped to be. They're the 37 states that ban same-sex marriage, and the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition 8 weren't broad enough to change that status. Don't get them wrong, many couples in these states feel the ruling is an overall victory, especially for "our folks in California [who] can be blissfully married again," as Maryland resident Nicolene du Toit, who anxiously awaited the ruling with her wife over the phone, put it. In addition to saying that same-sex marriages could resume in California, the court decided that same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. But some couples couldn't help but be disappointed that the rulings may not make a difference in their own states -- at least for now. What's next for gay rights movement? "Immediately, it doesn't mean anything," said Brandi Ansley of Atlanta. Georgia is one of the states that does not allow same-sex marriage. "There's no reason for us to run out and get married (in a state that allows it), because she wouldn't be able to insure me and the children." South Carolina resident Jordan Sullivan agreed. "It's a wonderful step in the right direction, but I still can't help but feel sad and disappointed that the ruling does not extend to all states, including South Carolina," said Sullivan, who's been with her partner nearly three years and would like to get married. "I can only hope we won't be like the last kid picked in gym class." And for couples like Casey Miller and John Martin, the federal benefits ruling brings up a number of questions that even legal experts don't agree on. Miller and Martin were legally married in California in 2008. But they live in Texas, where same-sex marriage isn't recognized. So will they qualify for federal tax, health and pension benefits? Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of law at the University of California-Irvine and a constitutional law expert, says yes. "A couple that was lawfully married in a state, but moves to another state, still is married," he said. "Their marriage has not been ended, even if not recognized in their new state. So they get all federal benefits accorded to married couples, though their marriage will not be recognized in their new state." But Neil Siegel, a law professor at Duke University and an expert on the Supreme Court, didn't think the issue was quite so black and white. Opinion: Fight for gay rights must continue "It's not clear," he said. "The federal agencies are going to have to decide, and different agencies may decide differently. Congress could always step in, and eventually you're going to have federal courts ruling. There may be additional protection from certain federal agencies, but it's not clear at this point which ones or when." "It wouldn't be surprising to me to hear the president order the federal agencies to say that if [a same-sex couple] is lawfully married in one state, that they have to provide benefits wherever they're living," he added. Same-sex couples: What the Supreme Court decision means for your finances Miller finds all the uncertainty frustrating and described the rulings as "an expensive baby step." "Are we still second-class citizens?" he asked. Other same-sex couples in states that do not allow them to marry say they're still worried about the same issues that plagued them before, like hospital visitation, adoption and end-of-life rights. And some say that, even if they could be afforded federal benefits by marrying in a state that allows same-sex marriage, they deserve the right to get married in the states where they've made their home. "I hope the Supreme Court takes the ruling a step further to make it a national law, so we can legally get married under big oak trees in Charleston, with our friends and family from all over the world sharing the joy and excitement on a day that once didn't seem possible," mused Sullivan. "To my LGBT brethren in more accepting states, especially you who got a double in California...rejoice and be happy, for this day is truly yours," wrote R.J. McKay, an Ohio resident who's been with his partner for 15 years. "For those of us stuck in less accepting states, this was a huge symbolic win...keep (your) eye on the prize." CNN's Christina Zdanowicz, Daphne Sashin, Nicole Saidi and Julia Carpenter contributed to this report.
That nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage is encouraging progress for those of us who believe that everyone deserves to have basic civil rights. But, even if every state in the country could pass a similar legislation, it would not be enough. What we need is for our federal government to step up and make this basic right a law of the land. Beyond the social discrimination, the refusal of our federal government to legally recognize same-sex marriages imposes steep financial penalties on same-sex couples. That two of the most costly penalties are triggered upon the death of one partner just adds to the ache of the senseless discrimination. I have been with my partner, Kathy Travis, for 12 years. If I am lucky I will spend the rest of my life living and sharing my joys and happiness with her. We have worked very hard as a team to save for our future together and consider everything we have as equally owned by the other. If the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, then when one of us dies our assets would seamlessly transfer free of tax to the survivor. That's a basic right that every heterosexual married couple has. But because there is no federal recognition of same-sex marriage, if I die first, or vice versa, before either of us can inherit what is now jointly our assets, there would be a federal estate tax bill that one of us would currently have to pay. Again, to be clear: If we were a heterosexual married couple, there would be no estate tax regardless of the size of the estate or who died first. This spring, the Supreme Court will weigh in on the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Court needs to do the right thing and end discrimination against gay couples. We all have 83-year-old Edith Windsor to thank for in pushing the issue of same-sex marriage equality on to the national front. Edie and her partner Thea were together for 40 years. How many marriages do you know that have lasted that long? But when Thea died in 2009, Edie was hit with a $363,000 federal estate tax bill because as a same-sex couple they were not eligible for the unlimited marital deduction. Are we really a nation that says it is fair and just to demand Edie pay a $363,000 penalty because she is gay? There's another penalty that's even worse. Regardless of the size of their estates, every gay couple is discriminated against when it comes to Social Security benefits. Married heterosexual couples can maximize their Social Security retirement benefits by taking advantage of the highest-earner's benefit. When both spouses are alive, the lower earner can opt to collect a monthly benefit check that is equal to 50% of his or her spouse's benefit. For many married couples, that 50% spousal benefit is often much higher than what the lower-wage-earning spouse could collect based on his or her own earnings record. Most important, when the high earner dies, the surviving spouse is allowed to collect 100% of the deceased's higher benefit. Because same-sex marriages aren't recognized on the federal level, gay and lesbian couples are not eligible for Social Security spousal benefits. The lower earner cannot claim any benefits based on the higher earner's benefit. A heterosexual couple married for just a few months is able to collect a federal benefit that same-sex couples who have been together for decades can't. Are we really a nation that says that is fair? Beyond those two glaring death penalties, health insurance is another area of severe federal financial discrimination against gay couples. I am so glad to see more employers extending health insurance benefits to same-sex partners. But because same-sex couples are not considered legally married under the eyes of the federal government, the dollar value of the health coverage is considered taxable income. A 2007 study estimated that this gay health insurance penalty costs same-sex couples an aggregate $178 million ($1,069 per household), while employers paid an additional $57 million in payroll tax on that taxable income. No heterosexual married couple or their employers pay that penalty. Again, are we really a nation that says that is fair? The social and civil discrimination that persists as long as our federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage is inexcusable. Add in the financial discrimination gay and lesbian couples face and the current policy becomes all the more indefensible.

Waking up to realize you suddenly have no leg or legs is as horrible an experience as one can have, and one that will, sadly, be faced by a number of people injured in the bombing of the Boston Marathon. It happened to me when I was 16 after a bone cancer diagnosis and amputation (the cancer later spread to my lung and caused a lung to be removed as well). As I looked down in the recovery room to where my right leg used to be, all I saw was a short stump. This is frightening for sure, and only one of the things you're dealing with after an amputation. Luckily perhaps, your entire being is consumed just with healing; the bigger issues come later. First thing to deal with is massive physical pain from the surgery, and it will be worse because of the shrapnel packed bombs. The explosive force traumatizes the tissues and the fragments injected into the body cause collateral damage. Modern medicine does well with pain management, so this phase will, luckily, pass quickly. For the new amputee, challenges come fast and furious, but so does the natural "fight" that is in all humans. My very first challenge was trying to stand on one leg. The body and the mind do not adjust immediately to major changes like the loss of a 25 pound leg, so balance while standing up is elusive. But it will come and that is a first little victory. It's the first of many little accomplishments that begin to build up one's zeroed-out self-confidence. Our bodies heal and adapt well--the mind is a bigger challenge. Someone newly disabled naturally has thoughts of "why me?" as well as feelings of loss, despair and even depression. As John Green wrote in a wonderful book called "The Fault in Our Stars," about a boy who lost his leg to cancer, "You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world." Bad things happen and all we can do is adapt and move forward. Terrorists make us lose sight of the real dangers We are pretty attached to all our body parts, so of course there is a sense of loss. People don't study ahead for how they will deal with every possible eventuality that affects the trajectory of their lives. This new horrible reality of being disabled is a shock. There is fear of the unknown. What will I be able to do? How do I get back to normal? Will people stare at me because I look different? And it is easy to imagine how this leads to the tar-pit of self-pity. But that is not what happens to most people and it won't happen with the Boston Marathon bombing survivors. Compared with the primitive prosthetics of my youth, modern prosthetics are technological marvels. It is surprising to most people, but prosthetics' most important role is not ambulation: They are a social device to "level the playing field" and allow others to see you as not different. Today's computerized knees keep people from falling (with mine, I have gone seven years without a fall; before that, for 33 years it happened once a week). They cut energy use for walking in half, and allow normal stair walking. But there is a down side. A computerized above-knee prosthesis is between $50,000 and $60,000, of which the best insurance companies typically pay about 80%. That can be $12,000 out of pocket. This is where we can help the new Boston Marathon amputees. Opinion: Getting on with life after terror hits By far the biggest long-term issue for anyone knocked down in life is the loss of self-esteem. Humans require strong self-esteem for a healthy, happy life. As Gloria Steinem said, "Self-esteem isn't everything, it's just that there is nothing without it." She's right. Building back the lost self-esteem is the hardest and most important challenge for the newly disabled. How does one do it? I found that sports were key. I liked sports and, of course, physical activity was good for me. Pick something you like. Focus. Work hard at it. Work harder than anyone else. You can't help but get good at it. That feels good. That makes you want to work even harder. You keep getting better and better at it and then others stop saying you are pretty good, considering you only have one leg, and start respecting you. You've won and your self-esteem rises and takes your happiness up with it. I started with skiing, which at first was more "turn, fall, get up, turn, fall, get up" than swooshing down the slopes. Now I am a double-black diamond (amputee) skier. I tried biking and every year join a 200-mile bike-a-thon. I added swimming and in May will do my 20th "Alcatraz Sharkfest" swim across San Francisco Bay. Crystal legs and snake arms: Artificial limbs as art The natural challenge-response we all have in us is what will be the biggest help to the new amputees. It goes like this: "You can't run with one leg." Says the amputee, "Who says I can't?!" and he or she will be off and running. We know that those with so-called disabilities don't fall into the pity tar-pit and in fact, do better than they or anyone around them ever thought possible. Some even excel far beyond what they had ever accomplished before they became "differently abled." Richard Bruno studied polio survivors in the '80s and wrote in "The Polio Paradox," "Polio survivors who were told they would never go to college or get a job became the country's best and brightest." Like who, you might ask? President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Johnny Weissmuller, Judy Collins, Jack Nicklaus, Dinah Shore, Alan Alda, Joni Mitchell and many more. These polio survivors had significant physical problems but refused the label disabled, and never accepted the word "can't." To them, to me, and I predict to these bombing survivors, disability is simply "different ability"; and just you watch, maybe even "superability." Who says they can't? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jothy Rosenberg.
Huge crowds in the Vatican cheered Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday as he made his first public appearance since announcing his resignation at the end of the month. He thanked the Roman Catholic faithful in several languages and said it was not appropriate for him to continue as pope. "I've decided to resign the ministry given to me by the Lord. I've done this in full freedom, for the benefit of the church," he told those gathered in a Vatican City audience hall for his regular weekly appearance. Benedict said he is fully aware of the gravity of his decision but he could not carry on as pope "if I don't have the strength that it requires." He appeared tired but not visibly unwell as he sat and read his remarks off several sheets of paper. Benedict later celebrated an Ash Wednesday mass that marked the beginning of Lent at St. Peter's Basilica in the afternoon. Opinion: Why pope will be remembered for generations The service was moved from St. Sabina Church, where it is traditionally held, to the Basilica to accommodate the larger crowd of worshipers, Vatican officials said. News Monday that Benedict was stepping down at the end of February "because of advanced age" shocked the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. He is the first pope to resign in nearly 600 years. Benedict will keep working until February 28, meeting with pastors from Rome, Italian bishops, and the visiting presidents of Romania, Guatemala and other countries, according to the Vatican press office. He will hold a final audience in Vatican City's St. Peter's Square on February 27, but the church is not planning a formal ceremony to mark the pope's departure, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said Wednesday. Benedict will simply leave at the end of his typical workday -- 8 p.m. in Vatican City, Lombardi said. The pontiff, born Joseph Ratzinger, will first go to the pope's summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, and then is likely to retire to a monastery and devote himself to a life of reflection and prayer, Lombardi said. He won't be involved in managing the church after his resignation. "The pope is well and his soul is serene. He did not resign the pontificate because he is ill but because of the fragility that comes with old age," Lombardi said. Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone on Wednesday thanked Pope Benedict for his service. "All of us have understood that it is precisely the deep love that your holiness has for God and the church which pushed you to this act," he said. The pope's decision was not linked to a recent medical intervention to replace the battery in his pacemaker, Lombardi said, adding that it had been a routine procedure. Benedict's unexpected move has inevitably prompted frenzied speculation over who might assume the papacy in his place. Opinion: Huge challenges await next pope The Vatican does not yet know when the cardinals will meet in a conclave to decide who will replace Benedict, but it must begin within 20 days of the pope's resignation, Lombardi said. He had previously said a new pope would be in place before Easter is celebrated at the end of March. While Benedict won't be directly involved in his successor's selection, his influence will undoubtedly be felt. He appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals who are set to make the decision. The number of electors could drop to 115, as two cardinals will turn 80 in March, when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote. More than two-thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope. The announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican. Much speculation has focused on whether Benedict's successor might come from Africa or Latin America, rather than Europe, where Roman Catholic congregations are shrinking. The pope's older brother, the Rev. Georg Ratzinger, speaking in Regensburg, Germany, said he expected to see a pope chosen from outside Europe one day -- but not just yet. "I'm certain a pope will come from the new continents but whether it will be now, I have my doubts," he said. "In Europe, we have many very able people, and the Africans are still not so well known and maybe do not have the experience yet." Opinion: Echoes of past in pope's resignation Among those considered front-runners for the role are Cardinal Angelo Scola, archbishop of Milan; Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, who heads the Vatican's office of bishops; Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, an Argentinian; and Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana. Whoever gets the nod, the selection of a new pontiff is expected to go smoothly. "We're not going to have a problem of two competing popes. If Pope Benedict still wanted to have influence, he wouldn't have stepped down," said senior Vatican communications adviser Greg Burke. While not quite unprecedented, Benedict's resignation is certainly historic. The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII, who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope. CNN's Isa Soares, Richard Allen Greene and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.
Alastair Cook might just be the most optimistic man in Australia right now -- for there are few who would back his assertion that the England cricket team faces anything other than "Mission Impossible". Thrashed by Australia for the second consecutive time in the five-match contest, England must now overcome 77 years of history to win the series. Not since 1936-37 has a team come from 2-0 down to win the Ashes -- on that occasion it was Australia which triumphed. What appears more likely is that England's horrific 5-0 whitewash defeat of 2006-7 will be replicated -- especially given Monday's 218-run defeat in Adelaide. "It's certainly not impossible," England captain Cook told a press conference following the day's play. "A lot of people who will be sitting in this room, and outside, will probably give us no chance. "But if we don't believe that in our dressing room, if we believe the urn has gone, then it might as well have gone. "Obviously 2-0 is not a great situation to be in. But if you look at a football game, the next goal can change it very quickly." England, which has won the past three Ashes series, has struggled from the outset against an Australia side which it defeated 3-0 only a few months ago. Only once before have England lost successive Tests by a margin of more than 200 runs, but following the 381-run loss in Brisbane, it now faces an almighty challenge to avoid humiliation. Many of England's problems have come in their batting line up which has failed to pass 400 in its past 20 Test matches. It now heads to Perth where it has only managed one win in 12 attempts and the scene of a 267-run defeat three years ago. One of the most frightening prospects for England is facing Australia's fast-bowler Mitchell Johnson, who has already taken 17 wickets in the first two matches. The extra pace and bounce in Perth will make Johnson even more dangerous -- an intimidating proposition considering the paceman took nine wickets at the WACA the last time these two met. Captain Cook has struggled for runs at the top of the order while the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Matt Prior have also failed to live up to their billing. Needing 284 more runs for a final day triumph, England never looked like pulling off a miraculous victory. Instead, it lost its final four wickets for just 65 runs. A win for Australia at Perth will seal its first Ashes triumph since 2007 -- not bad for a team which has only won two if its past 12 Test matches. "It's going to take a monumental effort from us to do it," added Cook. "But we're the only guys who can turn it round. "It was a better display in this second innings. (It was) by no means perfect, at all, but it was better than it had been. "That's a small step, only a small step, but it's heading in the right direction." Australia captain Michael Clarke, who is expected to make his 100th Test appearance at Perth on Friday, is in confident mood following his side's strong start to the series. Clarke, who made 148 in the first innings at Adelaide, says the hard work his players put in during the English summer has finally come to fruition. "It's not a fluke we have won the first two Test matches ... we believe, after the work we have been putting in for a long period of time, we're seeing some results. "The other side to that is, the reality is we have won two Test matches now in the past 12 months - and that is not acceptable as an Australian test team. "We have started this series very well, but there is a lot of work still to do." One man who is entitled to enjoy Australia's current success more than any other is Johnson -- the man who was subjected to constant taunting from the England supporters during the 2010-11 series. Johnson did not feature in the last Ashes contest and England's batsmen must be wishing he was overlooked for this current series with the Australian striking fear into his opponents at every opportunity. "I guess having that intimidation factor is definitely a bonus," Johnson told reporters. "It wasn't probably quite there in the last couple of Ashes series for me - so to be able to come out, just back my ability, and know what I wanted to bowl, I will continue to do that throughout the series. "I won't let myself get too excited ... it's all about not getting too far ahead of yourself."
Colombia laid out its case against Venezuela Thursday in front of the Organization of American States. In a lengthy speech before an emergency meeting of the hemispheric body, Colombian Ambassador Luis Alfonso Hoyos provided photos he said were evidence of rebel camps in Venezuela belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the National Liberation Army, or ELN. At the end of Thursday's meetings, the member countries reached an agreement to cooperate on a unified front against drug trafficking and terrorism. However, the body did not come down in favor of one side or another in the latest spat between Colombia and Venezuela. Stoking the flames in a long-simmering fire between the two countries, Colombia accused Venezuela of not acting on information that Colombian rebels were safeguarded in Venezuela. On Thursday, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez responded by announcing that his country would sever diplomatic ties with Colombia. "Some activity from these last weeks show there is real danger that is materializing by that consolidated, active and growing presence of terrorist groups in the brother country of Venezuela," Hoyos said during Colombia's presentation. He said that since 2000, there has been a 50 percent decrease in the number of murders in that country, and a 96 percent drop in kidnappings since President Alvaro Uribe took office eight years ago. Hoyos showed photos of an alleged FARC attack on June 20 in the Colombian city of Arauquita, near the Venezuelan border. The rebels came across the border and attacked the Colombians from a base in Venezuela, Hoyos said. In all, the FARC has 1,500 rebels in Venezuela, Hoyos said. Many of the photos and intelligence came from rebel defectors, Hoyos said, adding that Venezuela has not acted on the information given to them by Colombian authorities. "Of course Colombia is open to cooperation, but it has to be based on reality, not in rhetoric, insults or attacks," Hoyos said. Colombia asked for an international commission to be formed that would visit the locations where Colombia alleges rebels are camped out, to confirm its findings. "You want a solution? Here it is. Name one moral reason that should impede this -- none. To the contrary, it would be completely immoral, criminal and murderous to impede this from happening," Hoyos said. Venezuela's ambassador to the OAS, Roy Chaderton, denied that any of the evidence presented by Colombia proved that rebels were in his country. "They are very curious photos," Chaderton said, adding, "(taken) from I don't know where." The terrain between Colombia and Venezuela looks very similar, he said. Some of the alleged photos showing a rebel leader at a beach appeared to have been taken in Colombia and not Venezuela, he said. Despite Hoyos' statistics, Chaderton said that violence and drug trafficking continue in Colombia. "The FARC, the ELN, and the paramilitaries are a Colombian phenomena and remain in Colombia because the president who most bragged about getting rid of them couldn't complete his promises," Chaderton said. Colombia was stirring the conflict by pressing for the emergency meeting of the OAS while ignoring calls from third parties for more time for consultations, he said. "This does harm to the Organization of American States," he said.
Before this week, most Americans had likely never heard of Kyrgyzstan and even fewer could place it on a map. But the central Asian nation, which is about the size of South Dakota, is important to U.S. foreign policy for one simple reason: a vital military base through which tens of thousands of troops pass every month on their way in and out of Afghanistan. The fate of the Manas Transit Center was thrown into question Wednesday when Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev was forced to flee the capital after angry mobs seized government headquarters. Fighting between police and protesters left 75 people dead and hundreds injured, authorities said Thursday. The protesters say they are in control of the government, but Bakiev sent word Thursday from southern Kyrgyzstan that he is not abandoning his duties. The United States likely will retain use of the Manas facility even if Bakiev's opponents secure control of the government, said Alexander Cooley, a central Asia expert at Barnard College. Latest news out of Kyrgyzstan "It's going to survive, but it's going to generate a lot of noise, uncomfortable negotiations and a lot of hard bargaining," said Cooley, author of "Base Politics." The Manas base plays a major role in internal Kyrgyzstan policy on several levels. For starters, it is a major source of income in the small nation, which has a gross domestic product of less than $12 billion a year, according to the CIA World Factbook.  The nation ranks 143rd in the world in terms of its GDP. In exchange for use of the base, the United States provides about $180 million in aid to Kyrgyzstan each year, Cooley said. Although the United States does not pay rent for use of any bases in the world, Cooley said, about $60 million of the Kyrgyzstan aid is considered payment for access to the Manas facility. In addition, Cooley said, Bakiev's political opponents say the United States pays about $160 million a year to buy fuel for American aircraft using the base. "The base is as much an economic investment as much as it is a security investment," Cooley told CNN. "Kyrgyzstan does not have a lot of economic assets. That's why the base is important." But the base also has deep significance to Bakiev's opponents, who see it as a symbol of the deposed president's corruption and U.S. complicity in his abuse of power. "The United States stayed silent as Bakiev built a criminal state," Cooley said. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video Political opponents believe that aid paid for use of the base went into Bakiev's pockets, not the country's coffers. "That money went to companies and shady off-shore enterprises controlled by the family," said Cooley. "It's the actual site of tacit deals and corruption." The new government has said it will address citizens' concerns. Kyrgyzstan has had a troubled history since shortly after gaining independence when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Also gaining independence that year were the three other "stans," as some people commonly refer to the region: Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. "Kyrgyzstan seemed to be in the 1990s the one bright spot," Cooley said. Askar Akaev, who had been president since 1990, started off as a good leader, Cooley said, "and politics were pretty pluralistic. Then, he started regressing." Akaev increasingly turned to repression. "As they do, he stayed a few years too many," said Cooley. "Bakiev was bad, but Akaev was a real thug." As happened this week, opponents took to the streets in 2005 and drove Akaev from power. Bakiev won election as president in July 2005. But he, too, soon started to maneuver to increase his power and consolidate control. Demonstrations by political opponents in April, May and November 2006 led to the adoption of a new constitution that gave some of the president's powers to parliament and the government. A year later, the parliament voted to restore some of those powers to the presidency. In September 2007, the new constitution was declared illegal, and Bakiev resumed having the presidential powers he had inherited when taking office. "The president then dissolved parliament, called for early elections and gained control of the new parliament through his newly created political party, Ak Jol, in December 2007 elections," the CIA World Factbook says. "In July 2009, after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics, Bakiev won re-election in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed. "Just a few months later in October, Bakiev engineered changes in the government structure that further consolidated his already considerable hold on power." The CIA World Factbook says concerns about Bakiev's rule, "included privatization of state-owned enterprises, negative trends in democracy and political freedoms, endemic corruption, improving interethnic relations, electricity generation and combating terrorism." That such turmoil should fall upon such a country seems incongruous to some. "Kyrgyz are great," Cooley said. "They are very hospitable. Very mild-mannered." The CIA World Factbook describes Kyrgyzstan as a land of "incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions." With an estimated 2009 population of about 5.4 million, Kyrgyzstan ranks No. 111 among nations. It is a landlocked country and entirely mountainous, with 94 percent of the nation 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) above sea level and an average elevation of 9,000 feet (2,750 meters), the CIA World Factbook says. The topography includes many tall peaks, glaciers and high-altitude lakes. Nearly two-thirds of the nation's citizens belong to the Kyrgyz ethnic group, while nearly 14 percent are Uzbek and more than 12 percent are Russian, the CIA World Factbook says. Likewise, nearly 65 percent of the people speak Kyrgyz, which is the official language. Nearly 14 percent speak Uzbek and Russian is the language for more than 12 percent. Three of every four citizens are Muslim and one in five are Russian Orthodox. Although Kyrgyzstan shares a 533-mile (858-kilometer) border with China, most people identify with mother-nation Russia. Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to Russia in 1876 and became a Soviet republic in 1936. "There's a strong cultural affinity to Russia due to media, education and the Soviet legacy," Cooley said. Still, China is knocking at the door. "China has moved in, but it's been a very recent development," said Cooley. "Last year, China did a lot more trade there than Russia did. But there's very little cultural affiliation with China." There is no seeming affinity for the United States, a distant nation tied in the minds and hearts of many Kyrgyz to corruption at home. The question that remained unanswered this week was whether millions of dollars in U.S. aid would provide enough affiliation to allow continued use of the Manas Transit Center.
Ten U.S. Muslim organizations threatened this week to cease working with the FBI, citing "McCarthy-era tactics" by the agency, including efforts to covertly infiltrate California mosques. Stephen Tidwell, then of the FBI's Los Angeles office, speaks at the Islamic Center of Irvine in 2006. The groups claim the FBI has sent undercover agents posing as worshippers into mosques, pressured Muslims to become informants, labeled civil rights advocates as criminals and spread misinformation. The FBI declined to comment on specific allegations but called the proposed move unproductive. "Limiting honest dialogue, especially when complex issues are on the table, is generally not an effective advocacy strategy," spokesman John Miller said in a statement. "The FBI has continued our outreach efforts, across the board, with a number of concerned groups and where we agree -- or disagree -- most have concluded the best results are achieved through continued conversation. We believe that, too." The group's statement, dated Tuesday, said several incidents of the FBI "targeting Muslim Americans lead us to consider suspending ongoing outreach efforts." The statement was issued by the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections, whose director, Agha Saeed, couldn't immediately comment because of a family emergency. The FBI has sent "agents provocateur" into California mosques, according to the statement, which says an FBI agent threatened to make one mosque member's life a "living hell" if he did not become an informant. Though the statement does not name the mosque member, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said last month it would seek an investigation into the February 21 arrest of Ahmadullah Niazi, an Afghanistan native. "Mr. Niazi previously reported to [CAIR's Los Angeles office] and other community members that, during a raid of a friend's house, an FBI agent urged Mr. Niazi to work with the agency, saying that if he refused to cooperate his life would be made a 'living hell,' " a news release said. Niazi, a member of the Islamic Center of Irvine, told CAIR his arrest was retaliation for his refusal, the release said. The FBI directed questions about Niazi's arrest to the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, California, which declined comment. Niazi, 34, was indicted last month on charges of perjury, procuring naturalization unlawfully, using a passport procured by fraud and making false statements. A search warrant for Niazi's Tustin, California, home said Niazi became a naturalized citizen in 2004 and made false statements about his past aliases and international travel. He also made false statements about contact with his brother-in-law Amin ul-Haq, the indictment said. Ul-Haq is said to be Osama bin Laden's security coordinator and has been labeled a "specially designated global terrorist" by the U.S. government, the indictment said. An FBI agent said in open court that Niazi also had discussed terrorist plots with an undercover informant, according to media reports. Niazi has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. CAIR's problems with the FBI began before Niazi's arrest. Last year, the FBI discontinued its "formal contact" with CAIR. The Tuesday statement said the FBI unjustly designated CAIR and other organizations as "unindicted co-conspirators" in the Holy Land Foundation case. A jury convicted Holy Land Foundation leaders last year of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for a terrorist group. "Making this unjust designation public violates the Justice Department's own guidelines and wrongly implies that those listed are somehow involved in criminal activity," the statement said. The FBI's Miller declined to comment on specifics, but said the FBI wants to avoid "formally constructed partnerships" with CAIR. "Our concerns relate to a number of distinct narrow issues specific to CAIR and its national leadership," Miller said. Before the FBI severed formal ties, CAIR officials had met with the FBI to discuss hate crimes targeting Muslims. On occasion, CAIR offered assistance in investigations. The group also held training sessions for FBI agents on Islamic culture and ways to improve interactions with the Muslim community. CAIR this week called the FBI allegations a "campaign of smears and misinformation," a remnant of the Bush administration. "It is not surprising that we would be targeted in a purely political move by those in the previous administration who sought to prevent us from defending the civil rights of American Muslims," said a statement from the group's national communications director, Ibrahim Hooper. Tuesday's group statement also mentioned "a flourishing of anti-Muslim activity" during the previous administration and expressed fear that "counterintelligence programs are quelling lawful dissent." Unless the FBI affords fair treatment to all mosques, Muslims and Muslim groups, the statement said, Muslims should consider suspending ties to the agency. "This possible suspension, of course, would in no way affect our unshakable duty to report crimes or threats of violence to our nation," it said.
The Orionid meteor shower put on a cosmic light show for the Northern Hemisphere over the weekend. The Orionids peaked early Sunday morning as more than 25 meteors an hour streaked the night sky. The astronomical event caught the attention of many photographers over the weekend. iReporters from across the world stayed up late or woke up early for the chance to catch a glimpse of the meteor shower. Renata Arpasova set her alarm a few hours early, waking up at 1 a.m. to see the Orionids from Wiltshire, England. She found a clear patch of sky and was thrilled to see a few big, bright meteors pass overhead. She described the Orionids as being magical. "I love meteor showers, and have always been fascinated by them from an early age," she said. "They're nature's fireworks, and they are so breathtaking, especially when you get a big fireball that burns through the astrosphere." "And you get to make a wish every time you see a meteor," she said. A childhood love of space inspired Robbie Lopez to wake up early to watch for the Orionids as well. He was disappointed to look out his window at 2 a.m. and see extensive cloud coverage in Richmond, Virginia. Determined to capture a photograph of the Orionid meteor shower, he drove 25 minutes to a remote field in Chester, Virginia, and says he was not disappointed with the show. "The shower itself was quite a beautiful sight," he said. "I had seen the occasional shooting star and had always wanted to see a shower, but never saw one until that night." He described the shower as a quick process, with streaks of light dashing across the sky, lasting for only fractions of a second. "The sheer number of them made the wait in the cold worthwhile," he said. "I was even more surprised by how many more meteors my camera captured that my eyes did not see." The quick dashes of light from are produced when the meteoroids strike the planet's atmosphere at approximately 148,000 mph, according to NASA. Fast meteors have a tendency to explode, becoming fireballs in the sky. Once a meteor explodes in the Earth's atmosphere, it leaves behind a trail of stardust, which viewers on the ground see as streaks of light, or the meteoric tail. In North Wales, Kevin Lewis watched a late movie to pass the time before the Orionid meteor shower. He sat outside snapping photographs of the Orionids from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. Despite the chilly weather, he found the experience relaxing. "Meteors always capture my imagination," he said. "Considering they are mere specks of dust, they have a huge impact on the viewer." The Orionid meteor shower occurs annually in October as the Earth passes through a patch of space debris left from the famed Halley's Comet. The space dust enters the Earth's atmosphere as meteors, creating what we now refer to as the Orionids, which seems to shoot from the constellation Orion, the Hunter. Although the Orionids is not the strongest meteor shower, it is considered one of the most beautiful, according to NASA. The meteor shower is framed by some of the brightest planets and stars in the sky, like Venus, Mars and Sirius. Did you miss the Orionids' peak over the weekend? You may still be able to catch some streaking meteors for the next few days as Earth continues to pass through the remnants from Halley's Comet. Then post your best photos to iReport!
David Letterman paid tribute to his longtime friend Robin Williams in a 10-minute segment on Monday's "Late Show With David Letterman." "I knew Robin Williams for 38 years -- 38 years -- which, in and of itself, is crazy," Letterman recalled in an extended reminiscence. Williams died August 11 at his Marin County, California, home. He was 63. Officials: Williams apparently hanged himself with belt The two met at the Comedy Store, the famed West Hollywood comedy club, and Letterman remembered the first time he saw Williams -- who had been introduced as being from Scotland -- on stage. He said he and his friends were "feeling pretty smug," expecting trite jokes about haggis and the like. Instead, what they saw was Williams as audiences got to know him: a brilliant dervish, changing accents and making jokes faster than most people could think. "It's like nothing we had ever seen before, nothing we'd ever imagined before," Letterman said. "We're like morning dew, he comes in like a hurricane. ... He finishes, and I thought, 'Oh, that's it, they're going to have to put an end to show business.' " Robin Williams and the next generation of comics Williams quickly became a star, first with an appearance on "Happy Days" as the alien Mork and then with the popular series "Mork & Mindy." Letterman had a small role on one episode, thanks to Williams. The comedian and actor later came on Letterman's NBC and CBS talk shows a total of 50 times, Letterman said. After showing a short video tribute of those appearances, Letterman noted that Williams' death had caught him, like so many, off guard. "What I will add here is that, beyond being a very talented man and a good friend and a gentleman, I am sorry I, like everybody else, had no idea that the man was in pain and the man was suffering," said the visibly emotional host. Robin Williams: The man beyond the screen Letterman was on vacation last week when Williams died. Monday's show was his first back in the studio. See more comedy content at CNN Comedy.
A coalition of news media organizations has filed suit in an effort to get the government investigation into the Crandall Canyon mine accident opened to the public. Rescuers drill into the Crandall Canyon mine on August 16 to try to reach six miners trapped underground. The group -- including CNN, The Associated Press, The Salt Lake Tribune and the Deseret Morning News -- asked a federal court on Monday to stop the proceedings until a judge can rule on whether to open them. The suit also asked that a transcript be provided of any closed hearings that may have already occurred. The coalition noted that the same court ruled after a similar accident more than 20 years ago that the Mine Safety and Health Administration must make its proceedings public. "Sadly, another mine disaster and more Utah miner (and mine rescuer) deaths have led Defendant here to convene another MSHA panel, this time with a goal of determining MSHA's alleged complicity in the accident," the plaintiffs' attorneys wrote. "This MSHA panel today is basically doing the same types of things that it did 20 some years ago." The Department of Labor, which includes MSHA, has not allowed the news media access to its investigation into the August 6 cave-in of the mine in central Utah. Six miners were trapped and are presumed dead. On August 16, three other people, including an MSHA inspector, died as they attempted to reach the trapped miners, whose bodies have never been recovered. A call to the Department of Labor was not immediately returned. Also joining the suit is the Utah Media Coalition, representing Utah newspapers, television stations and journalism groups.

Service had been restored by midday Thursday for tens of thousands of AT&T's U-verse TV, Internet and phone customers after an outage that lasted several days. ""U-verse service has been restored for all customers affected by the outage.," AT&T spokeswoman Emily Edmonds told CNN on Thursday. "We know our customers count on their U-verse service, and we apologize for the inconvenience." Edmonds said the outage hit "a limited number of customers" in the South, some of whom were without service since Monday. The service has roughly 7.4 million subscribers. In all, fewer than 1% of those customers experienced the outage, according to an earlier AT&T statement. The outage was related to a software upgrade, Edmonds said, saying the problem was fixed by AT&T engineers Thursday morning. The service outage did not affect AT&T's landline or wireless service subscribers. User reports on a discussion thread in the AT&T forums spread from Florida to parts of Texas. By Thursday, many of them were reporting that service had returned. Not that it prevented several from venting their frustration. "I just got an AT&T ad in email that said how wonderful they are too," wrote one subscriber from Oklahoma. "Come on already. My husband says we are canceling. There is no excuse for no service at all for 3 days, no explanation, and not even following through on the ones that you had appointments scheduled with ... . Bad, bad, bad business." Edmonds said that affected customers will receive a credit on their bills. The credits will appear within 30 to 60 days, she said. U-verse is a "triple play" bundle of cable TV, phone and Internet services offered by AT&T. It was launched in 2006 and is available in 22 states.
A comic book chronicling the life of Prince Harry of Wales will be released in late August, publishers announced Thursday. "It's time to focus our attention on the Wild Child, Prince Harry. ... Prince William might be the one getting married, but Prince Harry continues to make waves all over the world," publisher Bluewater Productions said. "The Royals: Prince Harry" will join the graphic novel series dedicated to Harry's brother William and his wife, Kate Middleton. "The Royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton" was released in April to coincide with the royal wedding. "As Americans, we are fascinated by the British royals. They fit within our construct of a celebrity-fueled popular culture. But more than that, they represent an air of pomp and history that we just don't have," author C.W. Cooke said. Cooke has written comics for multiple series including "Female Force," which features the life stories of "strong women in politics" such as U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to the company's website. "The Royals: Prince Harry," featuring art by Justin Currie, will be available at comic retailers August 24. The standard comic will cost $3.99, but a collector's graphic novel will also be available online for $7.99, according to the statement.
The House of Representatives voted Friday to impeach a federal judge convicted of obstruction of justice while in office. Judge Samuel Kent was the first federal judge to be charged with sexual crimes while in office. U.S. District Judge Samuel B. Kent of Texas pleaded guilty in February, admitting he lied to investigators about nonconsensual sexual contact with two employees in his courthouse. As part of a plea agreement, other counts alleging sexual misconduct were dropped. Kent was the first federal judge to be charged with sexual crimes while in office. He has submitted his resignation, but made it effective June 1, 2010, meaning he would be paid for a year while in prison. That drew a heated response among some members of Congress, and a House Judiciary Committee task force unanimously approved four articles of impeachment against Kent on the grounds of sexual assault, obstruction of justice and providing false statements to federal investigators. Before the House vote, Judiciary Committee member Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said to House members that Kent collecting a salary of about $174,000 while in prison constituted "an attempt to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from the American people." There were no dissenting votes. The decision on whether to convict Kent will be made by the Senate. A conviction would mean he would lose his seat on the federal bench and his pension. Kent, who turns 60 this month, was sentenced in May to 33 months in prison and began serving the sentence Monday. He was ordered to undergo treatment for alcoholism while in prison. An attempt to reach Kent's attorney for comment was unsuccessful Friday afternoon. President George H.W. Bush nominated Kent, who took his seat on the bench of the Southern District of Texas on October 1, 1990. Kent is the 14th federal judge to be impeached by the House. The last impeachment -- on charges of lying to a federal grand jury -- was of Mississippi Judge Walter Nixon in 1989.
in certain less formal circumstances -- to white tie and tails in the evening. The exhibit contrasts country house life in Britain and the United States using fictional Downton and real-life Winterthur. The differences? For one, Americans have long loved their technology. "Americans love the history and style of Britain and the sporting life and kind of the gentleman's lifestyle, but Americans were completely devoted to the latest technology, modern conveniences and comfortable living." 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels Winterthur had its own telephone system with 95 exchanges by the time it was overhauled by Henry Francis du Pont in the early 1930s. It also had central heating and 23 bathrooms. In "Downton Abbey," anxiety accompanies the arrival of technological advances for many of the characters. Bringing the latest technology to American estates was easier, Eaton said, because homes were newer and successive generations were likely to regularly renovate to put their own stamp on the home. America's melting pot was also evident at Winterthur when the du Pont family was in residence, with a Swedish valet and a French ladies maid among many nationalities represented in the household. "The diversity of nationalities who work in these great houses really reflects the diversity of nationalities who were coming to America," Groff said. In Britain, servants had more direct ties to local villages and tenant farms. What newly wealthy Americans lacked in centuries-old tradition, they made up for in money. "By the late 19th century the Americans were the ones with all the money," said Eaton. "Downton Abbey" illustrates that wealth through Lord Grantham's American wife Cora, whose fortune has kept the estate from ruin, and her mother -- who occasionally sails in from New York sporting the very latest fashions. "Wealthy Americans were not at all behind," Eaton said. "They traveled, they frequented all of the best couture designers in both London and Paris." Yet the American fascination with all things British is still very much alive and well. The exhibition is on view at Winterthur through January 2015. The museum recommends advance purchase of the timed tickets. Entry to the exhibit is included in general admission, which is $20 for adults.
Relations between Arab nations and the United States hinge on American leaders living up to their rhetoric about commitment to lasting peace in the Mideast,  Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal told CNN Saturday. Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal talks with CNN's Nic Robertson about U.S. relations with Arab nations. "President Obama, in his statement yesterday, said that he's genuinely making the effort to accomplish a peaceful resolution," al-Faisal, who served as Saudi ambassador to the United States from 2005 to 2007, told CNN's Nic Robertson in an interview Friday. "We've heard this before," al-Faisal said. "We need to see implementation. We need to see facts on the ground change. We need to see rhetoric change. We need to see presence on the ground." He said he was encouraged by Obama's appointment of George Mitchell as Mideast envoy, saying, "Mitchell comes with a track record of success." But he suggested Mitchell spend some time in the region to make real progress. "American envoys, when they've dealt with the Middle East, have always come and gone," he said. "I think it would be wise for Sen. Mitchell ... to pitch his tent in Ramallah or in Jerusalem, let's say, and spend a year, two, perhaps three years on the ground dealing with the daily aspects of making peace there."  Watch as al-Faisal talks about how the U.S. and the Mideast could build trust » The United States' backing of Israel, in light of the latest Israeli military operations in Gaza, does not improve its standing in the Arab world, he said. "What happened in Gaza, people have called it a tragedy," al-Faisal said. "I'd go further and say it was a catastrophe in all aspects of that word. The killing and the destruction was so barbaric by Israel, and unprecedented in a such a small area like Gaza. They [Israelis] claim that they were very careful about collateral damage and they targeted only Hamas, as they call them, militants and operatives. Well, look at the figures. "More than 400 children killed out of 1,300 [total deaths]. That doesn't show any precision of targeting. Israel claims that these are mishaps of war. If they are mishaps of war, well, why should you have a war? "I think this is one of the issues that makes the relationship between the Arab world in general and Saudi Arabia in particular threatened when it comes to dealing with the United States," al-Faisal said. "...  And President Bush, I think callously and unforgivably, gave Israel a green light to do everything that they wanted to do in Gaza without restraint." U.S. and Israeli officials should recognize that operations like the recent one only serve to strengthen Hamas, as "Israel is a radioactive element in the area. Anyone it touches becomes heroic and legitimate ... because he or she is a victim." Al-Faisal said he believes the United States and Israel should negotiate with Hamas. Reminded that the two nations consider Hamas a terrorist organization, he said, "I think this is another of the things that has to be reviewed by President Obama." He believes that negotiations with Hamas should not undermine the Palestinian Authority, saying the authority's President Mahmoud Abbas "in my view, is the most tailor-made Palestinian leader for making peace and bringing stability and security to the Palestinian people." Israel's operation in Gaza came after what it said was a barrage of rockets fired by Hamas militants into southern Israel. Asked how to stop the rockets, al-Faisal said he thinks the key is to bring Hamas into the political fold. "Put it the other way," he said. "How can we convince Israel itself not to provoke Hamas into firing rockets?" Israel claims that Hamas fired first, and al-Faisal said these claims underscore the importance of having someone on the ground like Mitchell. "To see who is telling the truth in a case like that is needed, and a necessity today, more than at any other time," he said. The United States has called for nations like Saudi Arabia to accept Israel and normalize relations with the nation, he said, but Israel must make the first move. "Israel has to normalize relations with Palestine before Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel. Everybody asks us to recognize Israel and to normalize ... nobody asks Israel to recognize Palestine and normalize relations with Palestine. I think that's unfair." Arab nations stand ready to make peace with Israel, he said, but Israel has not demonstrated an equal willingness. "That's the pity of it." He said Obama should ask Israel to accept the Arab peace plan. "And when the Israelis accept the Arab peace plan, the Arab world has already set up a mechanism to deal with that issue. They've chosen Egypt and Jordan to sit down with the Israelis and deal with the Arab peace initiative." Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN the nation does not publicly discuss contacts with Arab nations with which it has no official diplomatic relations. Israel welcomed the Saudi peace initiative, he said, and is willing to negotiate with all Arab countries, including the Palestinians. Asked about his confidence in Obama, al-Faisal said, "I'll have confidence when I see things done on the ground, and President Obama can do something and gain the confidence and support of the Arab and Muslim nations by showing that he has done things on the ground and not simply expressed a wish for that." If not, he said the Arab world's relationship with the United States is at stake. "Popular sentiment, already America is at its lowest level in the history of its engagement with the Arab and Muslim world," he said. "In terms of government relations, that is something that will have to be decided by the leaderships in the Arab world and America, but it's not a pretty picture."
Documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan show that al Qaeda spoke of attacking President Barack Obama and Gen. David Petraeus, a source familiar with the materials recovered from the compound said Friday. The documents refer to an attack that would destroy the aircraft carrying Obama and Petraeus in the region, the source said, referring to the Afghanistan, Pakistan area. The documents also referred in a more general way to a desire by al Qaeda to attack the president and Petraeus, who was will be departing soon as the U.S. military commander in Afghanistan. A U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, described the Bin Laden documents as "him in his brainstorming mode ... hey, I have an idea, what if we did this." U.S. forces killed bin Laden during a raid on May 2. They recovered documents and other material during the raid. Petraeus declined to comment, a spokesman said Friday. Another U.S. official said the documents showed bin Laden was interested in attacking the United States on the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. According to that official, bin Laden wrote about "identifying a team of operatives to attack the homeland." But the official said there was nothing specific and "it's unclear his discussions about those operatives were more than discussion." The first official said overall, the documents indicate "these were ideas, not fully or even partially planned plots." Other materials taken from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan have confirmed that the al Qaeda leader communicated with the Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to a third U.S. official, familiar with the ongoing U.S. analysis of the documents. The search through bin Laden's materials has also found direct evidence that while in hiding in Pakistan, bin Laden was encouraging direct plots to attack Americans and U.S. interests in Europe late last year, according to the U.S. official. There were several threats at the time that led the United States to issue an October 2010 alert for Americans traveling in Europe, the source emphasized. Bin Laden was "aware, supportive and trying to motivate his operatives in Europe. He was pushing them," the source said. The U.S. intelligence community had classified information at the time suggesting that bin Laden was involved, the U.S. official said, but the documents taken from the compound have provided confirmation. Officials have previously said bin Laden always placed a top priority on trying to attack Americans.
On November 8, 1965, 48 American soldiers lost their lives during "Operation Hump" after the 400 men of the 173 Airborne Brigade were ambushed by roughly 1,200 Viet Cong fighters. I did not learn about this battle from a history book or teacher in school, but rather a popular country song -- "The 8th of November" by the duo Big and Rich. Whenever someone asks me why I love country music, I think of songs like that one, and Tim McGraw's "If You're Reading This," and the Dixie Chicks' "Traveling Soldier" -- each with lyrics that capture the toll war has taken on this nation's soul. Now, it would be disingenuous of me to pretend a black guy from Detroit listening to country is the norm. It's not, and I know it. But I'm not trying to be something that I'm not. My family is from rural Mississippi and I spent a lot of my childhood playing on the dirt roads south of Greenwood. I have an uncle who has yet to recover from his time in Vietnam. So I know full well the world many country artists sing about: the watering holes, eating fried chicken, going to church, God, war. When Rodney Atkins sings, "these are my people" I think: "yes they are." Obsessions: Crazy about country music So I am excited to see the crossover appeal of acts such as Lady Antebellum and Blake Shelton. I look forward to seeing Wednesday's Country Music Awards. But I will also tell you I am disappointed that so few artists will sing about the one glaring aspect of life in the country that greatly defines how many Americans view the genre -- and that is race. Scan the singles released over recent decades and it's as if race doesn't exist as an issue despite the South, the home of country music, being the backdrop for the beginning of the civil rights movement. How can so many songs, like "November," be written with such great detail about events that happened 40 years ago, in a country thousands of miles away -- and yet we hear hardly a peep about the battles over race and rights that occurred at the same time on the industry's doorstep? About the battles and conversations that are happening around it still? In 2009, country starlet Taylor Swift won the album of the year Grammy for her CD "Fearless." It would be encouraging to see more of country's songwriters embrace that word and be just that: fearless. Stop telling an abbreviated, sanitized version of their world while there is video from a surveillance camera in Mississippi showing a black man being beaten and eventually run over by a group of white teens who set out looking to attack the first black person they saw. While a word like "plantation" is used to describe the voting practices of black Democrats and "lynching" is tossed around regarding the media's treatment of a black Republican. I can understand the hesitation some white artists may have about approaching this subject. They're fearful of saying something offensive and country radio hates controversy (see Chicks, Dixie). But the truth is that not talking about the unpleasant parts of life in the country do not make them go away. It just allows others to tell your story for you. I've met some amazing people in the country music field: Good folks without a racist bone in their body. But they have seen and heard and lived through some disturbing things. They, too, have a point of view, a story. I wish the music would tell it. Not just for the sake of the artists, but for the millions of white Americans who come from small towns, listen to country music and should not be viewed as social pariahs by the rest of the nation because of it. Acknowledging racism does not perpetuate it but rather exposes the disease where it festers and hides. And just as "The 8th of November" taught me something about the Vietnam War, country music can remind people not to allow the stereotypical few to unfairly define the whole. In 2004, Kenny Chesney released his CD "When The Sun Goes Down," which included a song called "Some People Change." It was never released as a single but the song caught the attention of the duo Montgomery Gentry, who later covered it. The song became a top 10 hit for them in 2006, but not before they massaged the lyrics. Instead of Chesney's original: His old man was a rebel yeller, bad boy to the bone, and say can't trust a color feller, he judge 'em by the tone of their skin The duo sang "you can't trust that other feller," softening the language a bit. I'm sure it doesn't seem like a big thing to some, but I know some still refer to blacks as "colored" or worse. So while I applaud the group for going as far as they did, I would have preferred they just told the story like it is, with all the warts, gashes, scabs and wounds. After all, racism is ugly. It's OK to say so. It's OK to sing so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.
The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy. However, such transformation will not be easy. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt. While a success in matriculation -- 19% of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations. A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market. Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices. Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption, new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China's growing divide between the rich and the poor. The government has never publicly released household-level data necessary to study this problem. To gauge the scope of the problem, my colleagues and I at China Household Finance Survey conducted a nationwide survey, interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in China, both rural and urban. We found that China's Gini coefficient -- a number that is widely used to measure a country's income inequality -- is 0.61. This number suggests a level of income inequality so high that can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. In the U.S., this number is 0.39. Income inequality is the key reason for China's low consumption rate. The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings. The top 10% of households have 69% of the total savings, and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60%. Conversely, about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings. Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers, not exports, the key driver of China's economy. Why? The data suggests China's rich are already spending what they need, and pocketing most of the rest. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. Here the next generation of Chinese leadership can and should play a significant role. An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption, however, is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment and income transfer programs. Studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption. In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. Although 90% of Chinese population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems, benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums. Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance. Another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system. China's urban unemployment rate was at 8.0% in the summer of 2012. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance. It also pays too little: unemployment benefit is only 17% of the average salary compared to 47% in the U.S. and 60% in Germany. Given the challenges ahead, China's new leadership should view this with some urgency: When the economy is in transition, unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help. China can also learn from successful programs in the developed and developing countries. Programs such as Earned Income Tax Credits of the United States help the poor who actually work. Many developing countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and India have various Conditional Cash Transfer programs that pay poor families if they keep their kids in the school. Recognizing the serious income inequality problem in China, Beijing issued a new income redistribution policy in February. The new policy moves in the right direction, but is not nearly enough. Beijing plans to raise the government spending on social welfare programs by two percentage points within next five years, from 12% to 14%. The comparable number in the United States is 37%. If Chinese government wants to serious tackle the income inequality while helping boost consumption of the country, they have to work on a much larger scale. There is money on the table to support this. China's state owned enterprises (SOEs) are tremendously profitable due to their monopoly positions but only turn in less than 10% of those profits to the government. Beijing runs a budget deficit of only 1% of its GDP. According to the new plan, Beijing will demand five percentage points more of the share of the profits from SOEs. That's not enough. If Beijing doubles its budget deficit (still very low relative to most developed countries) and boosts revenue from SOEs on social welfare programs and income transfers, China would spend at similar percentage as the U.S. and inequality may be reduced to a similar rate. If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy.

When you put a pro- and an anti-gun control person in the same room, you know what's bound to happen. But what happens when two gun owners debate gun control? Turns out, there can be just as much disagreement. The elephant in the room in the wake of last week's Colorado movie theater shooting is the debate over gun control. Gun control is not an either/or proposition. Most would agree that at least some degree of regulation is necessary, so the real question is where to draw the line: At what point does regulation become an unreasonable encroachment on our Second Amendment rights? CNN selected two iReporters with differing views on gun control to go head-to-head in a debate. Both live in Washington state, one of the 48 states where carrying concealed weapons is allowed. Opinion: Bloomberg's remarks got one thing right Michael Kunda is an anti-hunting gun owner. He carries a gun for protection while filming bears and other large mammals in the woods of Alaska and Canada. At home, he carries a gun to protect his family from intruders. While he owns two pistols, a shotgun for his videography work and two assault rifles, he supports stricter gun control. He suggests establishing a bullet registry as well as outlawing large-capacity magazines and Teflon bullets. Kunda refers to himself as a reluctant gun owner, and says he would prefer a world without guns. In fact, he would turn all his guns in if everyone else did the same. "I firmly believe fewer crimes of spontaneity or impulse would occur if there were fewer guns. But I recognize I am being unrealistic and idealistic," he said. "It takes a societal change to get rid of the gun fanatic mentality anywhere in this world, and that kind of a change is not possible as long as the notion of 'freedom' is associated with gun ownership." Opinion: Fear drives opposition to gun control A ban on guns isn't the answer, at least not from David Douglas' perspective. He believes there is a good system in place for gun control and says changing the law wouldn't change what happened in Colorado. His reasons are personal: As a former convicted felon -- he was convicted of burglary and possession of drugs -- he was stripped of his right to bear arms. Douglas says his run-ins with the law and his loss of gun rights demonstrate the legitimacy and stringency of gun control in America. He now works as a substance-abuse counselor. "The process that I went through, 15 years of not being able to possess firearms and then the process to petition the courts to get those rights back, was worth it," he said. "Worth it in the sense that it showed me that it is a privilege in our nation to be in possession of firearms. Now, looking back, there is a pretty good system in place for who can and who cannot possess firearms after certain crimes are committed." Opinion: When will America wake up to gun violence? Douglas and Kunda are two of the hundreds of iReporters who have shared their views on a variety of hot-button political issues in the iReport Debate, an eight-month project that invites voters to make their voices heard this election season. The project started with iReporters sharing which issue matters most to them. The top-voted issues determined the topics for the head-to-head debates, and will shape the questions that CNN ultimately takes to President Barack Obama and likely Republican presidential nominee Gov.

Some private security guards hired to protect the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan say their contractor has allowed widespread mistreatment, sexual activity and intimidation within their ranks, according to the watchdog group Project On Government Oversight (POGO). A spokeswoman for watchdog group POGO said hazing at a camp for security guards went "well beyond partying." The group sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, and briefed reporters on its findings, which it said are based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the U.S. compound in Kabul. The company -- ArmorGroup, North America -- has a security contract with the State Department to provide services through July 2010, and has been cited several times for shortcomings in the security required by the contract. A U.S. Senate panel two months ago was critical of the State Department for not closely supervising ArmorGroup, after a series of warning letters from the State Department in the year leading up to the panel's inquiry. When CNN contacted Wackenhut, the corporate parent of ArmorGroup, a spokesperson there said the company would have a response Wednesday. The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it was taking the allegations very seriously. "Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of all Embassy personnel -- Americans and Afghan -- and respect for the cultural and religious values of all Afghans," it said in a statement. "We have taken immediate steps to review all local guard force policies and procedures and have taken all possible measures to ensure our security is sound." Should initiation rituals such as hazing be allowed? Sound off below POGO says two weeks ago it began receiving whistleblower-style e-mails, some with graphic images and videos, that are said to document problems taking place at a non-military camp for the guards near the U.S. diplomatic compound in Kabul. "This is well beyond partying," said Danielle Brian, POGO's executive director, after showing a video of a man with a bare backside, and another man apparently drinking a liquid that had been poured down the man's lower back. She told CNN that ranking supervisors were "facilitating this kind of deviant hazing and humiliation, and requiring people to do things that made them feel really disgusted." Watch claims that alleged hazing at the U.S. Embassy pose a threat to security » "This is not Abu Ghraib," she said, referring to images and videos of abuse by U.S. military troops against prisoners held at a facility in Iraq. "We're not talking about torture," she continued, "we are talking about humiliation," by supervisors causing a breakdown of morale, and a "total breakdown in the chain-of-command." In the letter POGO sent to Clinton, Brian wrote that the problems are "posing a significant threat to the security of the Embassy and its personnel." Among the recommendations from the group: immediate military supervision of the private security guards, a review of whether the contract should be revoked, and consideration as to whether government forces should replace private security in a combat zone.
The photographer who took the picture of a man about to be fatally struck by a New York subway car said Thursday that he did so in a desperate attempt to alert the driver of the train to stop. "From where I was, I could have screamed my lungs out; probably nobody would have heard it," R. Umar Abbasi told CNN's Anderson Cooper about the incident Monday in which 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han had been shoved onto the tracks in a Times Square station as a train approached. "The only way, I thought at that moment, was to start clicking away, releasing the shutter that will fire the flash, and make him aware that this is an unusual occurrence -- why is there a burst of light hitting him -- and catch Mr. Han on the track." Abbasi, who asked that CNN note that he was not paid for the interview (CNN does not pay for any interviews), estimated that he had been 400 feet from Han when he saw in his peripheral vision a body being flung onto the tracks. "There was a collective gasp that went into the air that really got my attention," he said. "People started waving their hands and screaming because, a few moments earlier, they had made an announcement that the train will be approaching the station and I could see the distant lights of the approaching train." Abbasi said he started running toward Han but stood aside and braced himself against the wall when he realized that the suspect was approaching him. "He seemed agitated, and as he was approaching, he was cursing and using profanities." Abbasi said the only thing he might have done differently would have been to urge Han to try to outrun the train. "I would have said, 'Mr. Han, run the other direction,'" he said. "There were only about three cars in the station and all he had to do was outrun three cars and he would have lived." Abbasi said he would have saved Han had he been able to do so. "It wasn't important to get the photograph; the photograph came out as a result of my effort -- or what I could think at that moment to do." Though he said he heard others urging Han to get up, "I don't know why anyone did not reach out." Abbasi said Han's end came quickly. "I could hear the sounds," he said. "I do not want to be too graphic about it for respect for the family, but I could hear all the sounds. Mr. Han did not scream or anything, this is how fast it transpired." The whole experience, he said, has been traumatic for him. "If I have to narrate the whole thing, it's like reliving it. I did not sleep for close to 36, 40 hours." Even three days later, he said, the photograph is chilling to him. "It's like I am looking at his end. And the oncoming train -- the metaphor for it -- death staring him down." Abbasi dismissed those who say he should have helped as "armchair critics." Naeem Davis, 30, a homeless man, was arraigned late Wednesday in Han's death and charged with second-degree murder. His next scheduled court appearance is Tuesday. Opinion: Why the outrage over photo in subway death Abbasi said he didn't look at the pictures before returning to the office and turning his camera's memory card over to police. The Post published them the next day. "Doomed" the headline screamed. "Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die." Readers and media critics quickly jumped on the newspaper's decision to use the image. On Twitter, users posted that it was cruel and "snuff porn." Lauren Ashburn, a media critic and editor in chief of the website Daily Download, called it "profit-motive journalism at its worst." "It's insensitive, it's inappropriate, it's sickening rubbernecking," she said Wednesday. But Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's "Reliable Sources" and the Washington bureau chief for The Daily Beast and Newsweek, said he sees an argument for publishing the image. "Because this is every New Yorker's nightmare," he said. "I do still wonder why the photographer's first instinct was to take pictures," he said. "I do wonder that." Jeff Sonderman, a fellow at the journalism think tank Poynter Institute, wrote on the organization's website that it appeared journalists were largely critical of the decision. "Even if you accept that that photographer and other bystanders did everything they could to try to save the man, it's a separate question of what the Post should have done with that photo," he wrote. "All journalists we've seen talking about it online concluded the Post was wrong to use the photo, especially on its front page." Kenny Irby, a senior faculty member for visual journalism and diversity programs at Poynter, said Tuesday that what the paper did wasn't necessarily wrong. "It was not illegal or unethical given that ethical guidelines and recommendations are not absolute," he said in an e-mail. But he also said the Post should have used another image. "This moment was such for me -- it was too private in my view," he wrote. "I am all for maximizing truth telling, while minimizing harm, which can be done by fully vetting the alternatives available and publishing with a sense of compassion and respect." The Post is no stranger to walking up to the lines of journalistic ethics -- and sometimes crossing them -- with its pithy, often lurid, coverage of crime and other news in the Big Apple. "HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR," the newspaper once famously shouted from its cover. Nor is the Post shot the first news photo to generate ethics concerns. An Agence France-Presse photo that won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize generated controversy for its depiction of a girl in Afghanistan crying amid a number of bloody bodies. Also this year, the New York Times published a graphic image showing blood streaming from the body of a victim after a fatal August shooting at the Empire State Building. At the time, Poynter quoted a Times spokeswoman as saying the image was "a newsworthy photograph that shows the result and impact of a public act of violence." CNN's Marina Carver, Pauline Kim, Yon Pomrenze and Mary Snow contributed to this report.
Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has included three uncapped players in his final 23-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa. Winger Pedro Rodriguez, 22, was named along with his Barcelona teammate Victor Valdes, who edged out 19-year-old David De Gea and Villarreal's Diego Lopez for the third goalkeeping place. De Gea's 21-year-old clubmate Javi Martinez was handed a midfield berth, having impressed as Atletico Madrid won the UEFA Europa League this season and reached the final of the Spanish Cup. "They have had a good season, they are coming to strengthen the squad as substitutes for other players," Del Bosque told reporters. Martinez's fellow under-21 international, Osasuna defender Cesar Azpilicueta, missed out along with midfielders Santi Cazorla and Marcos Senna, who both featured when Spain won Euro 2008. Sevilla striker Alvaro Negredo was also chopped, as was another member of the triumphant 2008 squad, Dani Guiza. Del Bosque is giving England-based stars Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas every chance to be fit, retaining the duo as they recover from injuries. Midfielder Andres Iniesta is also expected to be ready, having returned from a calf problem in the last game of the Spanish league season as Barcelona claimed the title. Barcelona's 19-year-old Bojan Krkic, who missed Spain's Euro 2008 success at his own request due to fatigue, did not even make the initial 30-man squad named earlier this month. England coach Fabio Capello was forced to go back on his previously iron-clad rules in selecting his preliminary squad for the World Cup. The Italian has always said he would not pick players who are injured or out of form, but brought Liverpool's Jamie Carragher out of international retirement to bolster his defensive options as cover with injury-prone captain Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King also in the 30-man line-up. Neither Carragher nor versatile Tottenham star King have yet played for Capello, who retained his midfield mainstay Gareth Barry despite the Manchester City player being in doubt for the June 12 opener against the United States due to injury. Carragher made himself unavailable in 2007 after not being often used by previous managers Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren despite being regularly named in squads. Blog: Will "the Force" be with Capello at World Cup? Capello also asked Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes to become available again following his own international retirement in 2004, but the 35-year-old turned down the opportunity. "He said no, he preferred to stay with the family. But I tried," Capello told the UK Press Association. Liverpool fullback Glen Johnson was named despite being sidelined with injury, while striker Emile Heskey retained his place although he has not been a first-choice selection for his club Aston Villa. Key forward Wayne Rooney was named despite his niggling groin problem, with Tottenham's Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch taking the other striking spots along with Sunderland's 25-goal Darren Bent. Winger Aaron Lennon was included after only recently returning with Tottenham after a long-term absence, as was fellow right-sided player Shaun Wright-Phillips despite his failure to win a regular place at Manchester City, who also have 22-year-old Adam Johnson in the squad. Midfielder Joe Cole also got the nod, having last played for England in 2008, after a strong end to a season that saw him on the fringe of league champions Chelsea's first team. Germany captain Michael Ballack was ruled out of the World Cup after suffering an ankle injury in the English FA Cup final. The Chelsea midfielder was caught by a bad tackle from Portsmouth's Berlin-born Kevin-Prince Boateng, who has decided to switch nationalities to play for Group D opponents Ghana and whose half-brother Jerome was earlier named  in the preliminary 27-man German squad. With No. 1 goalkeeper Rene Adler also sidelined by injury, the 35-year-old Hans-Jorg Butt received his first call-up since 20003 to vie for a starting place with Schalke's Manuel Neuer and Werder Bremen's Tim Wiese. Butt's young Bayern Munich clubmates Holger Badstuber, 21, and Thomas Muller, 20, gave the Bundesliga champions seven players in coach Joachim Low's squad. Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi has stuck with the players who qualified for South Africa in his 30-man squad, resisting suggestions that he should bring in-form Roma striker Francesco Totti out of international retirement. Totti's on-loan teammate Luca Toni also missed out along with veteran Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Villarreal's Giuseppe Rossi one of seven strikers named. Inter Milan's controversial Italy under-21 forward Mario Balotelli missed out as Fabio Quagliarella (Napoli), Vincenzo Iaquinta (Juventus), Antonio Di Natale (Udinese), Marco Borriello (Milan), Alberto Gilardino (Fiorentina) and Giampaolo Pazzini (Sampdoria) were picked. Lippi omitted his former Juventus player Nicola Legrottaglie despite the defender being included in a recent 29-man training squad. France coach Raymond Domenech has trimmed his initial 30-man selection down to 24, with Marseille striker Hatem Ben Arfa and Lille goalkeeper Mickael Landreau dropped along with defenders Adil Rami and Rod Fanni, midfielder Yann Mvila and forward Jimmy Briand. Defender Williams Gallas has been warned by Domenech that he must prove his fitness, having been sidelined since March with a leg injury. His Arsenal clubmate Samir Nasri missed out on the initial squad, but Gael Clichy, Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna were included. Young Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema also failed to pass the first selection obstacle, while the omission of veteran midfielder Patrick Vieira meant Thierry Henry was the only survivor from the 1998 World Cup-winning squad. Veteran Netherlands striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy has missed out on a place in coach Bert van Marwijk's 30-man, potentially signaling the end of the 33-year-old's international career. Van Nistelrooy left Real Madrid to join German club Hamburg to revive his hopes following a serious knee injury, but Van Marwijk said the player had not returned to a high enough level to be selected. "I told him that we have followed him closely and admire his commitment and dedication to get to the World Cup," Van Marwijk told AD Sportwereld. "I believe that Ruud is fit, but after his lengthy knee injury he does not have time to get back to his old level." Dutch champions Twente have only two players in the squad, which features 14 overseas-based names. Feyenoord defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst, 35, has announced he will retire after the month-long tournament. Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz named a 24-man squad due to doubts over a couple of players including Real Madrid defender Pepe, who has only just returned to training after being sidelined since December. Goalkeepers Beto and Daniel Fernandes were named as deputies to Braga's Eduardo despite not playing in any of the qualifiers, but there were no other surprises for the 2006 semifinalists, who will be led by Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel, Filip Holosko and fellow striker Robert Vittek were named in a 29-man squad by coach Vladimir Weiss despite their recent injury problems. Liverpool's Skrtel has not played for three months since breaking a bone in his foot, while Holosko is struggling to get over a broken leg suffered last year and Vittek -- who is also based in Turkey -- has had a knee problem. Weiss also selected his 20-year-old son and namesake Vladimir of English club Manchester City, who as loaned to Bolton this season. Serbia coach Radomir Antic named just five home-based players in his 30-man squad, with six from English Premier League clubs including key defender Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United. Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek kept faith with the players who helped the small East European nation qualify for the second time when he named his 30-man squad. Denmark coach Morten Olsen picked Thomas Sorensen in his 26-man squad despite the goalkeeper suffered a dislocated elbow on duty with English club Stoke last month. Olsen, who won more than 100 caps as a player and took Denmark to the 2002 World Cup, gave defender Patrick Mtiliga his first call-up since his debut in November 2008. Greece coach Otto Rehhagel has picked Christos Patsatzoglou and Giorgos Seitaridis despite the duo's struggles with injuries this season. The German selected nine overseas-based players including qualifying campaign top scorer Theofanis Gekas of Hertha Berlin, Celtic striker Georgios Samaras and Liverpool defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos. Switzerland defender Christoph Spycher has pulled out of coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's experienced 23-man squad for the finals after failing to overcome a knee injury. The 32-year-old, who had already decided to retire from internationals after the tournament, has been replaced by Ludovic Magnin -- one of seven reserve players named by the German. Hitzfeld has stuck with the likes of Blaise Nkufo of Dutch champions Twente, fellow striker Alexander Frei and midfielder Hakin Yakin, who are all 30 and above. Defender Philippe Senderos was included despite his lack of action with English club Arsenal, while Sampdoria midfielder Marco Padalino and Kosovo-born Swiss under-21 international Xherdan Shaqiri were also included.
The World Health Organization reports that 88 percent of the 1.8 million deaths resulting from diarrhea can be attributed to unsafe water or inadequate hygiene or sanitation. Unfortunately, a significant population in the city of Hubli, India, fall victim to these causes, and they are not even aware of the cause. The University of Southern California Hubli Water and Health Team is spending this summer implementing a project model that will improve these statistics in the community. The team of six students, visiting from the University of Southern California, will guide a pilot project in the under-served community of S.M. Krishna Nagar. Over the course of the next year, the Team will employ local college students to maintain the program and monitor the efficiency of the water purification technology. And by subsidizing the cost for those living within S.M Krishna Nagar, the Team will be providing state-of-the-art purification systems at affordable prices, creating an important sense of ownership and empowerment for the people. The team also plans to build awareness within the local community about the need to drink purified water. While the source of water currently received by the Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation is filtered, sewage leakage and the poor management of waste often contaminates drinking water on its way into the homes. This means that while the water from these pipes or the bore wells may look clean, it can be hazardous to drink. To compound the issue, even water contained in holding tanks on vehicles that visit the community is by no means guaranteed to be of sufficient, purified quality. The tanks carrying the water are rarely cleaned and the taps through which the water is dispersed may easily be contaminated. Families must be aware that the water they are provided is harmful to their health and provides a catalyst for breeding mosquitoes carrying malaria and other transferable diseases. Local reports have proven this, and communities in the past have fallen victim to water-related illnesses as a result of their consumption of unclean water. The USC Hubli Water and Health Team team hopes to shed light on this threatening issue, as confronting the challenge of dirty drinking water is a "gateway" step towards achieving measured, sustainable improvements in a wide array of serious health related issues. Through education at key points of community influence and the measured introduction of new technologies that encourage responsibility over simply charity, the Team will use its time in Hubli to affect change that is both scalable and sustainable.
Here's what we know about Saturday's crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 and some of the key questions raised by those facts: 1. Based on the debris field, the aircraft appears to have struck the rock sea wall well before the start of the runway. There are some marks on the sea wall, consistent with an impact of some part of the plane. Some aircraft debris ended up in the water. What we don't know: Did the flight crew simply land the aircraft short? 2. Passengers onboard the aircraft describe the engines spooling up and the nose tilting up just before impact, and a preliminary review of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders appear to show the pilots attempted to abort the landing 1.5 seconds before impact. 3. The debris field runs from the water, slightly right of the paved threshold and runway center, all the way to the stopped aircraft fuselage. The Boeing 777 lost its tail section, including vertical and horizontal stabilizers, near the end of the paved threshold, just before the start of the runway. What we don't know: Is this an indication the tail of the aircraft detached after first impact? 4. What appears to be the Boeing 777's right engine is detached from the wing and wedged against the right side of the fuselage. Another engine is a considerable distance from the fuselage in a grassy area to the right of runway 28L. This appears to be the left engine. Girls killed in crash were headed for camp What we don't know: When did the engines detach? Given the debris on the right side of the runway, could the engine off to the side actually be the right engine? 5. A preliminary reading of the flight data and voice data recorders show the 777 was traveling well below the target approach speed of 137 knots, the National Transportation Safety Board said. 6. Flight tracking records show that the Asiana 214 flight descended from cruising altitude much more steeply and rapidly than previous Asiana flights on the same route. 7. The instrument landing system approach on runway 28L was not working on the day of the crash. It had been down for some time. Flights were landing using visual flight rules. The weather was clear. 8. The runway's precision approach path indicator lights, showing correct flight approach altitudes, were working. 9. Most of the fire damage to the aircraft occurred after the 777 came to a stop on its belly. 10. Passengers described the cabin interior as heavily damaged, with overhead bins dropping and at least one life raft/escape slide inflating inside the aircraft, trapping a flight attendant, who was freed by passengers. 11. Audio recordings of air traffic control conversations show the pilot did not declare an emergency before the crash landing. Emergency vehicles were dispatched afterward. 12. The aircraft was built in 2006 and was purchased new by Asiana. 13. All four pilots on the plane have been interviewed by U.S. and South Korean investigators, the head of South Korea's Aviation Policy Bureau said. What we don't know: What did the pilots say about the speed, altitude and other factors before the landing? Choi Jeong-ho, the head of the aviation bureau, said he could not release details pending the investigation, which he said will continue for at least a week. 14. The San Francisco Fire Department said one of the victims killed may have been struck by an emergency vehicle, San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said. Asiana has identified the two deceased passengers as Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia of China. Both were 16. What we don't know: Which teen girl may have been struck by an emergency vehicle? And did the girl die from the plane crash or from the vehicle? Foucrault said his office is trying to determine the cause of death. Why so many people survived CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Richard Quest and Miguel Marquez contributed to this report.
Trains are as intrinsic to life for India's billion-plus people as cars for Americans. Think, then, what it means that the Railway Ministry has been accused of ignoring "massacre" on the tracks. About 15,000 people die each year simply trying to cross India's mammoth network of railway lines, much of it left over from colonial days. That according to a scathing new safety report that blames the government for a lack of safety on a railway system used by 20 million Indians each day. Often, vast slums hug tracks and people live lives synchronized with the rhythms and noises of the trains roaring by. They walk the tracks every day as though it were their backyard. The report by the safety panel, set up in September after a series of rail accidents, said many of the deaths resulted from outdated technology and a lack of infrastructure. "Reluctance of Indian Railways to own these casualties, which do not fall under the purview of train accidents but are nevertheless accidents on account of trains can by no means be ignored," said the report issued recently by the High Level Safety Review Committee. "No civilized society can accept such massacre on their railway system," it said. The panel said 6,000 of the deaths occurred in Mumbai's commuter system alone. "We feel the grim situation on the Mumbai suburban system has to be tackled on a different war footing," it said. People are dying, it said, because of unmanned train crossings and a lack of barricades, fences and pedestrian bridges. Or the platforms are too narrow and stations lack facilities such as elevators for the disabled. Another 1,000 people die because they fall off crammed compartments or in train collisions, the report said. It said accidents of a minor nature and near misses were not included in the data. The report made a host of safety improvements and recommended a budget of about $20 billion over the next five years to implement changes. "The demands on the system are rapidly growing without commensurate investments for upgradation of technology and modernization consistent with modern times," the report said.
Women have been some of Sheryl Sandberg's harshest critics, but the thousands who gathered over the weekend in Chicago at BlogHer, the largest conference in the world for women bloggers, fully embraced the "Lean In" author, crowding around her for a handshake and a personal photo and giving her a standing ovation after her keynote appearance. Sandberg's repeated message to the women here was that "Lean In," her best-seller that has now sold 1 million copies, wasn't just about encouraging women to become a CEO or run for office. " 'Lean In' is about believing in ourselves and reaching for any ambition," the Facebook chief operating officer and mom of two said, adding the book was directed at all women, from the work-at-home mom fighting for a better teacher for her children to a woman reaching for the C-suite. "It's about each one of us asking ourselves what we would do if we weren't afraid and then reaching for those ambitions." In light of criticism her message is elitist or critical of women who don't have sky-high aspirations, Sandberg seemed to take pains to clarify what leaning in means for women such as the many work-from-home mom bloggers at this conference. Were these remarks a shift in her message, I wondered as I listened, a recalibration after her book set off a national debate about what it means to "Lean In" or a message that Sandberg had always wanted to send from the start? "It's not a recalibration, but if the message got lost, I have to take some responsibility," Sandberg told me with a chuckle during a press conference. She said that while she considered writing a more detailed book, which she seemed to indicate would have included the stories of women from all walks of life, to make it "really authentic," she focused mainly on her experiences and those of the people around her, who happen to be corporate women. "The intention was for the message to be really inclusive so that message is important to me," she said. Judging by the response from women I chatted with after Sandberg spoke, her message came through loud and clear this time. "I had always taken 'Lean In' as go all the way to the top," said Danielle Herzog, a mom of two who blogs at Martinis and Minivans. "Well, what if I don't want to go all the way to the top right now?" But after hearing Sandberg speak, Herzog concluded that leaning in means simply "following your dreams," whether they lead you to the boardroom or not. "What I took away from this is you should be the best at whatever you want to be," said Norine Dworkin-McDaniel, co-creator of an illustrated humor blog about parenting, "I don't want to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. I would hate that, but I can be the best CEO or chief of scientific snarkiness of Science of Parenthood." Another point that resonated with the women here was Sandberg's concern about how we're raising our daughters, leading to what she calls a "leadership ambition gap" -- how by middle school, in survey after survey, more boys say they want to lead someday versus girls. "And no wonder because little girls figure out really easily that the boys are going to lead and be liked and they are going to be told, 'Do not be bossy,' " she said. Leigh Baker, who writes about the comical side to parenting, didn't realize until she listened to Sandberg how differently she's raising her son and daughter. "I am guilty of saying that she's bossy," she said. "I encourage her to be a leader on the field, but I don't encourage her to be a leader off the field, but I do the exact opposite with my son." Sandberg's celebrity status following the release of her book has led to speculation she might be looking for her next act beyond Facebook, maybe even considering a run for public office. "No, I'm doing about all the leaning I can do right now," she told BlogHer co-founder Lisa Stone with a laugh. Facebook, she made clear, remains her focus, but she'll also spend as much time as she can on her "Lean In" online community, which now has more than 250,000 members, making it one of the fastest-growing communities on Facebook and the most engaged, according to Rachel Thomas, president of Sandberg's nonprofit, LeanIn.org. To demonstrate the power of that community, after her keynote, Sandberg joined dozens of women at BlogHer as they broke into small groups to conduct "Lean In" circles designed to allow women to open up to their peers about questions such as what's holding them back. "There were tables that cried, they cheered, they clapped, and at the end, they talked about ... how they felt, and it was amazing. 'We can do anything,' 'I feel empowered.' That is why circles are growing so rapidly," said Thomas, noting how there are more than 7,000 registered circles in all 50 states and at least 50 countries. During Sandberg's time at BlogHer, I was struck by the disconnect between the criticism she's received nationally -- especially from some women -- and the response she received here from women, many of whom are not working in corporate America. "I thought she was really humble and approachable, and I wasn't really expecting that," said Kelly Glover, host of the blog Big Curvy Love, who had a chance to meet Sandberg. Deb Gaisford, a mom of an 18-month-old who blogs at Urban Moo Cow, said she thinks much of the criticism stems from women trying to defend their choices. "I think it's because people are looking at their own situations and clinging to their own sort of insecurities and not really being open to her message." Jessica Ziegler, co-founder of the blog Science of Parenthood, said she doesn't find any of the criticism surprising. "People love to stir it up. It's so much easier to have a big fat negative opinion than to get behind a movement that is trying to support a huge group of people."

For a little while, it looks like "Up," Pixar's 10th feature-length film, is going to be a downer. In "Up," a curmudgeonly senior citizen, Carl, tries to cope with the enthusiasm of Russell, a young boy. Not that there's anything wrong with an animated film tugging at our tear ducts. But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds. They gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway. That leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters. No, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of "Up" » Such misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, "Up" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials. There's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes. And there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or "Wilderness Explorer" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around? "Up" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs. But if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth. Russell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm, haplessly helpful. He's the mirror image of the child Carl used to be, if only the old man were capable of recognizing it. But instead of looking around him, Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com: Share your review of "Up" Written by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- "Up" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance. The balance isn't quite as tight as in Pixar's best movies, but the lightness is appealing, and Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) is an irresistible character. He's already carrying his own emotional baggage at 8 years old, but he's all heart, the kind to give kids a good name. Screening in 3-D where possible, "Up" doesn't go overboard on stereoscopic gimmickry, but does exploit depth of field in a string of exhilarating cliffhangers and dogfights. Funny and poignant and full of life, "Up" easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far. Go with someone you care about. "Up" is rated PG and runs 96 minutes.

The field of potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016 might have just gained one more name: Sen. Lindsey Graham. Known for his hawkish foreign policy approach, the South Carolina Republican told the Weekly Standard in a story published Friday that he'll enter the race if he thinks he's the most competent messenger for a more aggressive foreign policy approach. "If I get through my general election, if nobody steps up in the presidential mix, if nobody's out there talking — me and McCain have been talking — I may just jump in to get to make these arguments," Graham told the Weekly Standard. Graham has called for airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to fight terrorism, a position that aligns well with some 69 percent of Republicans who identify themselves as "hawks" according to a CNN/ORC poll last week. The senator, who maintains an 18-point lead over his Democratic opponent in his campaign for a third term, emerged as a vocal critic of the White House in 2012 when four Americans were killed in an attack at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. When it comes to one other possible 2016 hopeful, Sen. Marco Rubio, Graham says the Florida Republican's relative inexperience could be a disqualifier. "He's a good guy, but after doing immigration with him — we don't need another young guy not quite ready," Graham said in the Weekly Standard interview. "He's no Obama by any means, but he's so afraid of the right, and I've let that go." Though a presidential bid for Graham, 59, is likely a long shot, he's earned accolades from McCain if he were to throw his hat in the ring. "I've strongly encouraged him to give it a look," McCain said. "I think Lindsey has vast and deep experience on these issues that very few others have."
A major rainstorm washed over the water-weary Northeast Tuesday, flooding much of the already saturated region but focusing its withering power on the tiny state of Rhode Island. "Right now, most of our eyes are on the Pawtuxet River in Cranston," said Tom Econopouly, a senior hydrologist at the Northeast River Forecast Center in nearby Taunton, Massachusetts. The river was predicted to crest Wednesday morning near 20 feet -- flood stage is 9 feet, he said, adding, "It's very high." Another record was set in Yantic, Connecticut, where the Yantic River crested Tuesday at 13.6 feet, 4.6 feet above flood stage, he said. Yet another record was predicted for Saxonville, Massachusetts, where the Sudbury River was expected to reach 13.4 feet Wednesday afternoon. Flood stage is 10 feet. "I've been working here for over 10 years and I really haven't seen anything like this in my career," Econopouly said. Is it flooding near you? Share photos, videos and stories The cause of all the records was a storm system "that just didn't move" since it formed Sunday night, he said. By late Tuesday, the storm was lifting, but several rivers had not yet crested, he said. In all, the storm system dumped 8.75 inches of rain in East Providence, 7.6 inches in downtown Providence, and 5 inches in Cranston, all in Rhode Island, he said. Compounding the misery was the fact that parts of the region were still trying to shake off the effects of a storm two weeks ago. And this week's system -- with heavy winds and rain -- has left thousands of customers without power. On the National Weather Service map posted on its Web site, the coast was covered in bright green from Maine to Delaware, indicating widespread flood warnings. "We haven't seen the worst of it yet," Rhode Island Gov. Donald Carcieri told reporters Tuesday night after seven to eight inches of rain had inundated much of the state. He pleaded with state residents to stay off the roads. "We are very concerned about flooding on the highways," he said. The Blackstone River in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and the Pawcatuck River in Charleston, Rhode Island, were not expected to crest until 8 a.m. Wednesday, he said. "None of us alive have seen the kind of flooding we are experiencing now," he said, calling the downpour an event that occurs once every 100 years to 500 years. Sewage treatment plants around the state were swamped, with one in Warwick, Rhode Island, "completely inundated," he said. That led the Department of Health to order the closure of all beaches in the state. Emergency officials asked residents of affected areas to try to conserve water. Decisions about school closings were to be announced in the morning, he said. Carcieri urged residents of low-lying areas not to jeopardize their safety by refusing to comply with officials' requests to evacuate. He noted that some members of the National Guard have been deployed to help. Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said about 120 homes had been evacuated in the western part of the city. Dam safety was to be monitored overnight, said Dave Smith, director of the Emergency Management Agency. "The water that's running through the throats of some of those dams is remarkable," he said. A spokesman for National Grid Energy Services said 12,000 to 14,000 customers were without electricity in the Cranston area, where a substation was underwater. In Westerly, Rhode Island, another 9,600 customers were in the dark, the spokesman said. He told area residents to expect rotating outages throughout the night and predicted they would continue for "a period of days." Gas was turned off in some areas, too, he said. Shelters have been set up throughout the state, said Rhode Island Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts. "We are looking at historic levels," said Luke Peterson, the assistant town manager for West Warwick, Rhode Island. The Pawtuxet River in Cranston and West Warwick, about 13 miles southwest of Providence, flooded a few weeks ago at record levels. This time, Peterson said, the town has received reports predicting that the river, which reaches flood stage at 9 feet, will crest at 17.5 feet at nearby Cranston. The river crested at 14.98 feet more than two weeks ago. "There's not a whole lot we can do," Peterson said. "If we try to hold back on our side, we'd make it worse for the neighboring community." Still, no deaths have been reported in Rhode Island. That was also the case in Massachusetts, where four to seven inches of rain had fallen in the eastern part of the state during this latest storm, said Scott MacLeod, a public information officer with the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency in Framingham, Massachusetts. Most of the flooding in Massachusetts occurred in the Bay State's southeastern corner county of Bristol, Massachusetts, where about 200 people were evacuated, he said. On Monday, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard, which was prepared to assist overnight, MacLeod said. A handful of shelters were open, though few people were staying there, and there were no reports of power outages in the state, MacLeod said. "It's mainly flooding issues -- closed roads, flooded roadways and basements." Though the rain was expected to stop overnight in Massachusetts, "the flooding will continue throughout the week for a number of our rivers and streams," MacLeod predicted. The storm delayed flights at Boston's Logan International Airport, all three New York-area airports and Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site. Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell said she was putting the state National Guard on alert to assist with flood control and sandbagging efforts. By Tuesday night, a spokesman for the state's Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said rivers were still rising. "We do have significant flooding in the southeastern part of the state," said public information officer Scott DeVico. Particularly affected were the areas around the Connecticut cities of Norwich, Stonington and Groton City, he said. But no fatalities had been reported and fewer than 400 customers were without power, he said. Though no major highways were shut, a number of secondary roads were closed in low-lying areas, he said. In New Jersey, the city of Wayne issued a flood warning but said it was not issuing evacuations. In Paterson, New Jersey, minor flooding was reported, the city fire department said. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Delaware Valley, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory.
When Atlanta police officers Bryan Ernest and Bernatt Collins get a burglary call, they know that the house they walk into will probably be stripped, right down to the materials inside the walls. Calls to Atlanta, Georgia, police are increasing for vacant homes ransacked by burglars. They are part of a special burglary detail formed to watch the increasing number of vacant houses resulting from unpaid mortgages. Drawing their guns, the officers approach an empty house and shout "Atlanta police!" before entering. It's a burglary call, and they have to expect the worst. But the officers usually get to a home long after the thief has gone, leaving Sheetrock hanging from the walls like shredded cardboard, giant holes in the ceilings and exposed wiring minus its valuable copper parts.  Watch foreclosed homes gutted by thieves » "This is all copper that they are taking out down the walls," Ernest said. "You can see where the outlets were, any bit of copper they take." The Atlanta Police Department doesn't know how many homes have been hit. The police are not keeping records that differentiate between thieves who steal from occupied homes and those who rip out copper and appliances from vacant houses, many of them the result of the nation's foreclosure crisis.  See foreclosures across the country » Across the country, law enforcement officials report that more empty houses are being burglarized. Developers are unable to sell newly built homes, and landlords have trouble renting properties. Atlanta is one of the few police departments that has formed a special vacant home burglary team. Rising copper prices are driving some of the thievery, but that's not all the burglars are taking. Wanda Vaughn and her mother, Vera, operate a contracting service. Banks and homeowners hire them to fix what's been broken and/or replace stolen items after a thief strikes. Sometimes they replace everything in a home and board it up to prevent more burglaries. Wanda Vaughn has seen water heaters ripped out and dumped on hardwood floors and carpet. "This has to be torn out and replaced," she said while walking through a burglarized house in Atlanta. "The baseboards have to be torn out because of mold on all the carpet padding and subflooring." Estimated damage: between $15,000 and $20,000 for only about $40 worth of copper. "They took the stove, the refrigerator, the cabinets, everything, including the kitchen sink!" Vaughn said. Although some areas Ernest and Collins have patrolled over the past year are areas typically targeted by criminals, the burglaries are becoming more prevalent in affluent neighborhoods. "The neighbors have been calling and saying they are hearing banging or seeing a vehicle that's parked at a house that's supposed to be vacant," Ernest said. Some thieves carry book bags full of copper. Others push baby carriages and shopping carts full of stripped building materials. "Whatever they can push or pull to get this stuff out, they use," Collins said. County and city code enforcement departments often have difficulty locating homeowners. Some live out of town, and others have abandoned the houses after being unable to make mortgage payments, police said. House investor Bob Forbes said it's a constant battle when a home he owns is burglarized. Forbes usually installs steel cages around the air conditioning units outside the houses, but thieves take the air conditioner apart and pull the smaller pieces through the cage, leaving an empty concrete slab and padlock dangling off the bars of the cage. "In one house, I betcha I replaced the air conditioning condensers three times, and they kept coming back," he said. "If you don't have somebody in the house, it's going to happen. In one house that was about to close escrow, the plumbing was perfect. I came in the next day, and the plumbing, including the toilets, was gone!"
A man arrested in Madrid on suspicion of planning an attack against a demonstration to protest the visit of Pope Benedict XVI was a volunteer for the papal visit's organizing committee, a committee senior spokesman said Wednesday. The suspect was arrested on Tuesday at the IFEMA fairgrounds by plainclothes police officers as he was about to receive a backpack and a green shirt worn by volunteers, said the spokesman, Rafa Rubio, the communications director for World Youth Day, told CNN. A police statement Tuesday said a man studying chemistry in Madrid was arrested on suspicion he was planning an attack against a march set to protest the high cost of the visit of the pope to the Spanish capital starting Thursday, the police said. The suspect "planned to attack using noxious gases and other chemical substances," the national police said in a statement. The alleged target was a protest march set for Wednesday evening in Madrid, on the eve of the pope's four-day visit. A police spokeswoman on Wednesday said the suspect is a Mexican national. The police statement said the suspect was studying general organic chemistry at Spain's government-backed Higher Council for Scientific Investigations. Rubio said the suspect, age 24, had completed the process to become a volunteer for World Youth Day and he added that the arresting officers at the volunteer check-in area were so discreet that many in the World Youth Day organization were not aware of what had happened until hours later. The man is no longer a volunteer, Rubio said. "His apparent thinking is not in the spirit of Christianity," Rubio said. "World Youth Day rejects all violence." World Youth Day has 30,000 volunteers, many of them from outside of Spain. At the suspect's home in the upscale Salamanca neighborhood of the capital, police seized a laptop computer, a portable memory device and two notebooks with notes about chemical procedures which were not related to his official studies, the statement said. The suspect also allegedly was trying to recruit adherents through the Internet. The police statement said citizen collaboration helped lead police to the man. The cost of the pope's visit to Spain, suffering a deep economic crisis with nearly 21% unemployment, has been top news here in recent days. Benedict XVI is coming to World Youth Day, a weeklong series of religious events that the Roman Catholic Church organizes internationally every three years, last held in Sydney, Australia. Organizers expect at least a million youth for the event and Madrid's streets already are filled with many thousands of young Catholics from around the globe, carrying their national flags. Organizers say the $70 million cost is totally paid by the young people and corporate sponsors -- with no cost to the taxpayer. But others in Spain say there are substantial hidden public costs, including the 10,000 police officers on duty for security, the use of the Cuatro Vientos military air base for Mass, and a discount for visiting Catholic youth on the city's metro, at the same time as regular metro fares have risen sharply. Critics including Spanish groups called Christian Networks, Lay Europe and a third run by atheists convened a protest march over the costs on Wednesday, and they said they expect up to 10,000 people.
Frustrated parents are dumping their teenagers at Nebraska hospitals -- even crossing state lines to do it -- and the state Legislature has scheduled a special hearing to try to stem the tide. A 14-year-old Iowa girl was left Tuesday at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Nebraska's "safe haven" law, intended to allow parents to anonymously hand over an infant to a hospital without being prosecuted, isn't working out as planned. Of the 17 children relinquished since the law took effect in July, only four are younger than 10 -- and all four are among the nine siblings abandoned by a man September 24 at an Omaha hospital. On Tuesday, a 14-year-old girl from Council Bluffs, Iowa, was abandoned at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs. The case marks the first time a parent has crossed state lines to abandon a teenager in Nebraska, authorities said. "The few situations we've seen so far demonstrate the need for a change in Nebraska's safe haven law," Gov. Dave Heineman said in a statement Monday. "In the coming legislative session, I will advocate for changes that put the focus back on protecting an infant in danger. That should be our priority." All 50 states have safe haven laws, but only Nebraska's lacks an age limit. Nebraska's part-time Legislature is adjourned until January, but two state legislative committees will hold a joint hearing November 13 to discuss a remedy. "They've got a huge problem," said Linda Spears, vice president for policy and public affairs for the Child Welfare League of America. "It's a pretty poorly constructed law to meet its original intent." When it was introduced in the Legislature, the bill had a presumed age limitation of 72 hours, said Todd Landry, director of the state's Division of Children and Family Services. "The original intent was to protect infants from the immediate danger of being harmed," he said. However, the law's final language uses the word "child" and does not specify an age limit, leaving it open to interpretation. Other states' laws specify the maximum age at which a child may be relinquished, ranging from 72 hours in several states to 1 year in North Dakota, according to the National Center for State Courts. "Clearly in these cases so far that we've seen, none of these children were in any immediate danger of being harmed," Landry said. "It is our opinion that the law does need to be modified." The law is being abused, Heineman's statement said. "Safe haven laws were not designed to allow families having difficulty with older youth and teenagers to abandon their children or responsibilities as parents," he said. The parents may not always be to blame, the Child Welfare League's Spears said. "The original safe haven laws were created for young moms who are having babies who didn't know how to get help. I think these are families with older kids who don't know how to get help and who are in desperate need," she said. Most state laws fail to provide for research into who is abandoning babies and why, league spokeswoman Joyce Johnson said. "Those are the kinds of things we've been wondering about and saying we need to know more about, and you'll never know if you just have a law that says you can anonymously leave a child somewhere, no questions asked," Johnson said. New Jersey, she said, is an exception. That state's safe haven law provides funding for research and evaluation as well as $500,000 a year for public awareness, according to a September 2007 report by a New Jersey safe haven task force. A woman who dropped her 15-year-old nephew at a Lincoln, Nebraska, hospital told CNN affiliate KETV last month that she and the boy's guardian could no longer handle his behavior problems.  Watch woman explain why she left 15-year-old at hospital » The woman, Cathy Poulin, said she tried discipline and medication, but nothing worked. The boy's mother died several years ago, and his father left him, she said. "We had to go to the next level," Poulin said. "He can be made to get help." The Omaha man who left his nine children, ages 1 to 17, at Creighton University Medical Center was overwhelmed by the sudden death of his wife after the youngest child was born, he told KETV. "I was with her for 17 years, and then she was gone. What was I going to do?" Gary Staton said. "We raised them together. I didn't think I could do it alone. I fell apart. I couldn't take care of them." Staton is just the kind of parent whom safe haven laws fail to help, Johnson said. "He was grieving, he didn't have a lot of money, and all those children -- he was trying to figure out how to feed them, how to clothe them, and deal with the grief of losing his wife. He needed help," she said. Heineman and Landry urged Nebraska parents who are having trouble coping to call the United Way's 211 resource line or Boys Town, a nationally known nonprofit child services organization based in Nebraska. Other options include community and faith-based support groups, crisis hot lines, treatment centers and other services, Landry added.
catching hoops and tackling jumps along the course. For Scott Ping, president of the North American Ski Joring Association, which hosts its own World Championships at the end of January each year in front of 4,000 spectators, the sport almost cost him his life. Ping does not ski -- he rides the horses instead -- but became precariously unstuck while training for one particular competition. "I was running my horse through ice and snow when it broke through the ground and half a ton of horse came down on me," he recalled. "It all happened in slow motion. "I heard my neck break, I heard it crack like a gun going off." With his head planted, he couldn't move. He was trapped in the snow, with just enough room to breathe in a gap under his chin. He had broken the C1 and C2 vertebrae in his neck and was now alone as his horse headed back to the barn. "I was getting very anxious that this was where I was going to die," he said. But eventually he regained sufficient movement in his arm to telephone for help and was in an ambulance 20 minutes later. Two hours later he was moving his toes and, defying the doctors, he was walking within two days. "The doctor said one tenth of 1% of people that have that injury live and one tenth of that number walk again. I'm walking." Despite the horrific nature of his injuries four years ago he returned to skijoring only to fall again and break eight ribs leading to a longer hiatus from the sport, which ended two years ago. For him, it is a drug he just cannot give up: "It's a lot of fun, it's a kick. I don't think there's any sport to compare to it. It's an unusual combination of old cowboys and skiers getting together to make a big run. When I compete, the adrenalin is just unbelievable." As for the wider appeal, he jokes: "The silly story is that some guys got together to have a combination of who the best horseman is, the best skier and the best drinker, and this combines all three!" So what exactly makes a good skijoring competitor? Moro, who like his fellow riders has to take an exam in order to be eligible to compete, explains: "First it is experience, and knowing what can happen in a race so you can react when something goes wrong. "You have to be a very good skier and you have to have the feeling of the horse. You need to be a team. Often these are horses you don't know so they need to get an immediate confidence from you." Edging into his 2015 season finale, Moro continues to master that triumvirate in what is perhaps the purest form of horsepower.
A few hundred people on Sunday marched in Brooklyn to protest last week's fatal beating of a 31-year-old Ecuadorean man -- an incident authorities say may have been a hate crime. Jose Sucuzhanay was beaten December 7 after leaving a party at a church. The demonstrators -- holding signs reading "No more hate crimes" -- walked a half-mile in the neighborhood where police say Jose Sucuzhanay was hit in the head with a bottle and beaten with an aluminum baseball bat on December 7. Sucuzhanay died of his injuries Friday at Elmhurst Hospital, hours before his mother arrived in New York from Ecuador, his family said. Police said Sucuzhanay's attackers yelled racial slurs; no arrests have been made in the case. One of his brothers, Diego Sucuzhanay, said Sunday he is convinced the attack was a hate crime. "Nothing was taken from him," said Diego Sucuzhanay, who didn't join the demonstration, opting instead to help his mother make arrangements to return the body to Ecuador.  Watch marchers protest against hate crimes » Police said Jose Sucuzhanay and his brother Romel had left a party at a church when several men approached them in a car in Brooklyn's Bushwick section, about a block from the brothers' home. The men shouted anti-gay and anti-Latino vulgarities and attacked the brothers, police said. Romel, 34, escaped with minor scrapes and has talked with detectives. Police have released a sketch of one possible suspect in the case. Police are offering a $22,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in the attack. In a statement, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the attack "a pointless and gutless crime." He promised authorities would find and prosecute those responsible. Family spokesman Francisco Moya said Jose Sucuzhanay had lived in the United States for more than a decade and was a legal resident. Diego Sucuzhanay said Jose set up a successful real estate business in a low-income area, thinking he could make a difference there. He said his brother wanted to help everyone and hired a diverse team, including four African-Americans and two Latinos. He was raising two children: a 9-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. "We were proud of him," Diego Sucuzhanay said. He said the family had wanted Jose's mother to get to his bedside before he died. Doctors told them Jose was brain dead since the attack, and that machines kept him alive until his heart failed Friday. At a press conference Sunday outside the hospital, Diego Sucuzhanay touched his chest and said: "My heart is broken, but my brother's [memory] will live on. " Asked in an interview with CNN how his brother would be remembered, he paused several seconds and answered: "For being the victim of a hate crime." Though he didn't participate in the demonstration, he said he was grateful to those who did, and that everyone needs to practice tolerance. "We definitely have to speak out," he said.
In less than a week, Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows, while Microsoft announced that Office 10 will include free, online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at Google's suite of web-based office applications. The fight between Microsoft and Google is over who'll be seen as the world's most important tech company. And not more than a month and a half ago, Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing, which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online. From the news of it, it's a full-blown tech battle, complete with behind-the-scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other. It is, however, not a death match -- it's more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology, since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon. Google pulled in $22 billion in revenue in 2008, 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web. Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses, charging $50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor, email and spreadsheet programs away. By contrast, Microsoft sold $14.3 billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months, making a profit of $9.3 billion. It made a further $16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems, which range from XP installations on netbooks, to Vista, to Windows Mobile to its server software. Google now plans its own range of operating systems, starting with Android, an open-source OS for small devices like smartphones, and Chrome OS, a browser-focused, open-source OS that will run on notebooks and desktops. Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them, or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money. In fact, they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example, Microsoft's behind-the-scenes campaign to scuttle last year's proposed Google-Yahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement. But in reality, the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside. And it's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world's most important technology company. Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend. Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids, and you have a Microsoft family. And though it is much joked about, Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types, whether they are making small business software, massive online role-playing games or photo-editing utilities. Google's ecosystem looks different. It starts with a Google Chrome browser (oddly running only on Windows) with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage. From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor. But most importantly, Google wants you to search and travel around the web, hitting web pages that run Google-served ads and Google tracking cookies. You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology, while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium. So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition? Browsers: Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market (depending on who is counting and how). That dominance remains, even though Microsoft's latest offering IE8 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities. Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years, but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind, despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced. Why does it matter? Well, IE installations come with a default home page, don't they? Google's Chrome browser, on the other hand, is a handsome, whiz-kid of a browser. It's sleek and nimble, and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled. The address bar is the search box (Google as default, naturally). Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files. The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes, the rest are unaffected. Meanwhile, lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser. Chrome also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share. Online Search: Google's name now means search to most users. Google's search engine means money to Google. In June, it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to U.S. web users. In the first three months of 2009, Google pulled in $5.2 billion in revenue, a majority of which came from AdWords, an auction-based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query. Microsoft recently debuted Bing, a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google. It's got some fine innovations, and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data, rather than just retrieving links. Still, despite these improvements, a $100 million ad campaign, and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog, Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft 8.2 percent of all searches. Operating Systems: Microsoft has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting MS-DOS and Windows NT, the frameworks that Windows have been built around. Microsoft is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world. By copying its competitors' best features, leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators, Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost 30 years. That's despite challenges from Digital Research, Apple and IBM. Microsoft's newest version, Windows 7, will be available in the fall. Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast, and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista, the successor to Windows XP. Microsoft also dominates in the business world, where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office. Microsoft is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices, which it first launched in 2000. Its OS advantages are immense. It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows. There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows. Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware. And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs. By contrast, Google first stepped into the OS game in 2007 when it announced its Android operating system for small devices. Google estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year. Last week, Google announced, but did not show off, a new OS to compete with Windows, dubbing it Chrome OS. That name signifies that Google's OS will be for the web and browser-based. It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser, instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples' OS X do. It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser, allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help. Advertising: Google is largely powered by its innovative auction-based text ads on its own site, but then expanded into serving ads on other people's sites with the Adsense program. It bought the ad-serving and behavioral-profiling giant Doubleclick in 2007 for more than $3 billion, and has ventured into mobile, print, radio and television ads. Microsoft has struggled to replicate Google's online advertising success. Despite owning MSN.com -- a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination -- Microsoft has not made money on the internet. To turbocharge its ad-delivery technology, it paid more than $6 billion in cash in 2007 for aQuantive, a full-service online advertising concern. Instead, Microsoft's online ad business lost $1.2 billion in 2008, double what it lost in 2007. The company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $3.2 billion it took in last year, but has not said it would make a profit. Contrary to what some might have you believe, the benefits of the Google-Microsoft competition are immense. Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories. Gmail's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular, though not user-friendly, web e-mail service. Google Maps led to Microsoft's Live Maps, which now bests Google's efforts in some ways. Google has been winning the fight for the last few years, showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest. But the pendulum may be slowing, or even poised to swing the other way. With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsoft's online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent, Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users: on the field of innovation. And that will make for an interesting race, no matter which horse you prefer to ride. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here! Copyright 2009 Wired.com.
The U.S. military says only one supply route to Afghanistan has been closed by the Pakistani government after fighting that led to the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers, and a military spokesman said Thursday that United States is hopeful the situation is only temporary. Pakistan banned NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan after the deaths of the three soldiers, whom the government says were killed in Pakistani territory during fighting between NATO troops and militants, according to a military official from the NATO-led command in Afghanistan. Lt. Col. John Dorrian, an ISAF spokesman,  said the Torkham Gate in the Khyber Agency has been closed since about midday on Thursday. Chaman Gate, the other border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan, remains open. "We don't think it's a very serious problem," Dorrian said. "it's a throroughfare we use a lot so it is significant. But we can work around it." "We do expect these matters to be resolved." The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad is talking with Pakistan to resolve the situation. Supply convoys are all-important for the Afghan war effort, and officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were trying to persuade Pakistan to lift the ban. Coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from Pakistan to bring in supplies and gear. Torkham Gate is one of the main ports of entry for materiel coming into the war zone. But he emphasized it's not the only way of getting supplies in, he said. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region. About half the cargo that flows into Afghanistan comes in via one of the two gates from Pakistan, the Defense Department says. Another 30 percent uses two major routes through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, one via Russia and the other via the Caucasus. The remaining 20 percent -- mostly sensitive items like weapons, ammunition and other critical equipment -- comes in by air. ISAF said in a statement Thursday that its forces saw what they thought were insurgents trying to fire mortars at a coalition base in the Dand Patan District of Afghanistan's Paktiya province, near the Pakistani border. An air weapons team targeted the suspected insurgents' firing position, located inside Afghanistan along the border area, and the aircraft entered Pakistani airspace briefly "as they engaged this initial target," the ISAF statement said. After this strike, the "aircraft received what the crews assessed as effective small arms fire from individuals just across the border in Pakistan" and the ISAF aircraft, operating in self-defense, entered into Pakistani airspace and killed "several armed individuals." Later, Pakistani military officials told ISAF that coalition aircraft struck its border forces. "ISAF and Pakistani forces are reviewing the operational reporting to verify the exact location of the two engagements and the facts in this case, and we will work together to fully investigate this incident. "Both sides have in mind that it is the insurgents, operating on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan and violating the territorial sovereignty of both countries, that we are focused on fighting," the ISAF statement said. ISAF issued "sincere condolences to the Pakistani military and the families of those who were killed or injured." The Pakistani government said two helicopters from Afghanistan appeared to have crossed the border into Pakistan in the Mandata Kandaho, Ali Mangola area of the upper Kurram Agency and engaged an outpost of Frontier Corps through cannon fire. The post, manned by six soldiers, is located 200 meters inside Pakistan, and troops fired their rifles to indicate that the helicopters were crossing into Pakistani territory. Instead of heeding the warning, the choppers fired two missiles and destroyed the post, killing the three soldiers and injuring three others. "This is the third incident of its kind during past one week. In the wake of the last incident on 27 September, contact was made at the highest military level and the incident was regretted by the USA," the government said. NATO helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace from Afghanistan in pursuit of insurgents over the weekend, killing 49 people, a spokesman told CNN Monday. Crossing the border did not violate the International Security Assistance Force rules of engagement, Maj. Michael Johnson said. Pakistan is very sensitive about U.S.-led military operations on its territory and issued a strong protest Monday. Pakistan called the incursions "a clear violation and breach" of U.N. rules for foreign forces in Afghanistan. The United Nations "mandate terminates/finishes at the Afghanistan border. There are no agreed hot pursuit rules," Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A commander of international forces in the western part of Afghanistan said Thursday that Pakistan's recent ban on use of supply routes is "not a problem" for troops in his area of the country. Italian Gen. Claudio Berto, talking to reporters in the Pentagon via satellite from Afghanistan, said, "In my point of view, it's not a problem, we are really far away from Pakistan, and if you mean the goods for the soldier, they're coming through other borders, for example Turkmenistan. And we have no problem with this issue."
Raw video clips of Michael Jackson's last rehearsals will not be shown in the involuntary manslaughter trial of the late pop singer's personal physician, the judge ruled Monday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor spent several hours at Sony Pictures Studio on Friday reviewing about a dozen hours of video that prosecutors or defense lawyers proposed for the jury to see. "It was a waste of my time," Pastor said. It was not immediately clear if the prosecution would still be allowed to show parts of the "This Is It" documentary about Jackson's preparations for his London comeback shows. Defense lawyers had suggested clips "left on the cutting room" floor by the documentary editors might show that Jackson was in failing health in the days before his June 25, 2009, death. "It's quite the contrary," Pastor said. Lawyers for each side spent two weeks this month viewing more than 100 hours of video, narrowing down what they thought was relevant to the case. The prosecution selected 12 hours of video, while the defense identified four. Defense lawyer Michael Flanagan said after a hearing last Wednesday that the video showed him that Jackson was "very talented, that he's pretty good; even on his bad days, he's good." The defense was looking for clues in the video to show that Jackson was in ill health in his final days, but Flanagan said it was not detectable in his performance video. Jackson also did not appear to be depressed in his final days, he said. The defense will argue that none of the "This Is It" video is relevant to the criminal trial and would be "a big waste of time." "It shows him onstage performing," Flanagan said. "I don't know why that's relevant as to what happened the night that he died when he couldn't sleep." Jackson's death was from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol combined with other drugs, the Los Angeles coroner ruled. Murray, whom Jackson hired to care for him as he prepared for his comeback concerts in London, allegedly administered the fatal dose. Jury selection in the trial is set to begin on September 8 in a Los Angeles County courtroom, with opening statements later in the month. CNN's Michael Cary contributed to this report.
a small city unto itself -- are building Lusail at an estimated cost of $45 billion. Developers hope to complete the city by 2019, three years before Qatar is scheduled to become the first Arab country to host the World Cup. But all the city's sparkling features will lose some of their luster if soccer's big global tournament gets moved to another locale. Some activists have been pressuring FIFA, soccer's international governing body, to reconsider Qatar for a variety of reasons: allegations of bribery, the country's condemnation of homosexuality and the blistering summer heat, which can reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit. There also have been allegations that Qatar has used slave labor -- mostly migrant workers from Nepal -- to build Lusail's infrastructure. A report last year by the Guardian, the UK newspaper, said at least 44 construction workers had died of heart attacks and other ailments in a two-month period of 2013 amid grueling conditions. The state-run Lusail Real Estate Development Company, which is spearheading construction of the city, has said it's "extremely concerned" about the slave-labor allegations. In a statement on its website, the company added that it's investigating the charges, which involve one of its subcontractors. "Lusail City will not tolerate breaches of labor or health and safety law," the company said in the statement, posted in response to the Guardian article. It declined to respond to CNN's requests for comment. City of Tomorrow: How oceans can help solve our water crisis In response to criticisms, Qatar in May announced reforms to its labor laws, which had bound workers to a single employer and left them open to exploitation. This appeared to satisfy FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who called the changes "a significant step in the right direction." As for the brutal heat, Qatar says its stadiums will contain advanced, open-air cooling systems that will keep World Cup players and fans comfortable. Meanwhile, Lusail continues to rise slowly in the Qatar desert. Anchoring the city's skyline will be four commercial towers, up to 75 stories each. These will be surrounded by five-star hotels, an entertainment district and the Marina Mall, a retail palace measuring more than 600,000 square feet. Scheduled to open in 2017, the mall is a cluster of five interconnected pods, shaped like giant boulders, with cantilevered white roofs to repel the heat. Its architects want the space to evoke desert canyons. A canal runs through it, and waterfalls splash throughout. The scope and design of the mall echoes the grand, futuristic vision for Lusail itself. "It is a very ambitious and optimistic plan," said Daniel Hajjar, a senior vice president in HOK's Dubai office. It's a plan that has helped land Qatar the World Cup. But Hajjar said Lusail will be completed even if FIFA has a change of heart and finds a new host for the event. "Qatar has a path ... they're pursuing," he said. "It won't affect their decision to move forward and get it built."
Oh the irony. An Ohio man was shot in the arm. At a gun safety class. Michael Piemonte was attending a concealed-carry class with his wife Alison in central Ohio's Fairfield County over the weekend. Such classes are required for anyone wanting carry a concealed weapon in the state. There were 29 students in the lecture-type class, Piemonte said. He was sitting in the front row. While the instructor was demonstrating a self-defense techniques, the gun went off. The bullet struck Piemonte in the arm. Even he didn't realize what had happened. New law allows schools to teach gun safety to first-graders "Everyone was in shock," he told CNN. "It took me a couple of seconds to realize that I had been shot." The 26-year-old said he's in good spirits. "I'm just glad my wife did not get hit." The instructor did not return a call for comment, but Piemonte said he has been calling him regularly to check in. Five things to know about guns "It makes me feel good that he is so concerned," he said. The Fairfield County sheriff's deputy who responded to the scene described the shooting as accidental, The Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported. Piemonte doesn't have a gun yet, but was planning to get one this year. He still plans on doing so. "It was the first time I've been shot," he said. "And hopefully the last."

Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has scored the endorsement of Bob Dole, who lauded the former Massachusetts governor in an ad Sunday in Iowa's The Des Moines Register newspaper. The public endorsement comes one day after the Register -- Iowa's largest newspaper -- backed Romney in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and just over two weeks before Iowa's critical presidential caucuses on January 3. In his advertisement, Dole said Romney is the GOP candidate is best suited to defeat President Barack Obama in 2012. "I've known Mitt and his family for decades. His parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, rock-solid conservative values, and a deep sense of service to others," the former Kansas senator and 1996 GOP presidential nominee wrote. "These traits -- which have shone through in both the debates and in my own visits with him -- will serve him well in the White House." Dole also said Romney "rescued a flailing Winter Olympics when it was mired in financial scandal." And as governor of Massachusetts, Dole wrote, Romney "managed to both balance the state's budget and cut taxes while dealing with an overwhelmingly Democratic state legislature." The Register's editorial board said Romney was the most qualified candidate competing in the caucuses. While the paper didn't endorse Romney during his last run for president in 2007, the editorial board said voters now face a different GOP field and Romney "has matured as a candidate." "Rebuilding the economy is the nation's top priority, and Romney makes the best case among the Republicans that he could do that," the editorial board wrote. The board hailed Romney for his "solid credentials," saying he was the most likely candidate to see through "knee-jerk, ideological" perspectives and "bridge the political divide in Washington." Taking issue with the two other top-tier candidates, the paper claimed Romney stood out against former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whom the board called "an undisciplined partisan who would alienate, not unite, if he reverts to mean-spirited attacks on display as House speaker." It also criticized Texas Rep. Ron Paul as someone with a libertarian ideology that would "lead to economic chaos and isolationism." Also significant, the board somewhat defended Romney against a line of attack taken by opponents who criticize him as a "flip-flopper." "Though Romney has tended to adapt some positions to different times and places, he is hardly unique. It should be possible for a politician to say, 'I was wrong, and I have changed my mind'," the paper wrote. But the paper still reserved questions over his changing tune on issues such as abortion and said it was up to the voters to decide "whether such subtly nuanced statements express Romney's true beliefs or if he's trying to have it both ways." While the paper's endorsement is highly coveted, it does not necessarily spell success for a candidate. In the last election cycle, the paper endorsed GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who didn't actively campaign in the state and took third place in the caucuses, while former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee pulled off a surprise victory. The newspaper has long endorsed candidates for the general presidential election, but it began making endorsements for the caucuses in 1988. Since then, three of its choices went on to win the contest: Dole in 1996 and 1988 and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in 2000. In addition, three endorsees eventually secured the Republican nomination: Dole in 1996, Bush in 2000 and McCain in 2008. Only one of its chosen candidates - Bush in 2000 - went on to win the White House. According to an American Research Group poll taken Dec. 8-11, Romney placed second in the Hawkeye State with 17% of support among likely caucus voters, while Gingrich took first with 22%. Paul tied with Romney at 17% On Friday, Romney garnered a nod from South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley. South Carolina's primary, set for January 21, is the first presidential contest in the South and the third overall in the early voting season. CNN's Peter Hamby, Robert Yoon, Oliver Janney and Chris Welch contributed to this report.
Ten people were killed Tuesday when a gunman rampaged through a Finnish college, police officials said. Officials say Matti Juhani Saari began firing in a classroom at the college before shooting himself. Over the course of 90 minutes, Saari fired a few shots at police, Finnish broadcaster YLE said. Jukka Forsberg, a maintenance worker at the school, told YLE that the gunman was wearing a ski mask and walked into the building with a large bag. About 150 students were on campus Kauhajoki city's School of Hospitality in southwestern Finland. Forsberg said, "I heard several dozen rounds of shots. In other words, it was an automatic pistol. I saw some female students who were wailing and moaning, and one managed to escape out the back door." Smoke billowed from a building on campus, but officials could not immediately say what caused the fire.  Watch pictures from the scene » Tapio Varmola, who was visiting the school at the time, told CNN he was in a building about two blocks away when the shootings occurred. After the shootings, he said, he heard students shouting. Police came about 10 minutes after they were called, Varmola said. "It took two hours to get this situation ended," he said. Saari, 22, died Tuesday afternoon from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Tampere University Hospital, said medical director Matti Lehto. At least one other person suffered serious injuries in the shooting, he added. Police had interviewed and released Saari on Monday after he posted violent videos on YouTube, authorities said. As Saari did not directly threaten anyone in the videos, there were no grounds for further action, national police Commissioner Mikko Paatero told YLE. Authorities learned about the videos Friday but could not reach Saari until Monday, Paatero told YLE. Police also searched his home, YLE reported. Four videos of a man firing a pistol at a shooting range were posted by a "Mr. Saari" from Kauhajoki, where the college is based, according to his YouTube profile. The profile also included a video tribute to the Columbine High School shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, at the top of the man's favorites list. The videos were posted over a three-week period this month. None was posted in the last week.  Watch more about the YouTube videos » The account was suspended within hours of the shooting, which began about 11 a.m. local time (0800 GMT). MTV-3's Foreign Editor Risto Puolimatka told CNN that Saari was also issued with a temporary gun license last month. It was the gunman's first license, Puolimatka said. Finnish President Tarja Halonen expressed her condolences from the United Nations, where she is attending the annual General Assembly. She also commented on the YouTube videos. "We, parents and elderly people, have a little bit of feeling about the Internet," she said at an impromptu TV interview. "It's like a strange planet for us. But it's not so. It's part of our world, so we have to step in." She praised efforts by police, who she said "were already on board" by interviewing Saari. Authorities hoped that was enough to take care of any threat, but "now we see that it was not," she said. The school taught late teens and young adults, Jarkko Sipila of MTV 3 told CNN. "It's more or less like an agricultural or professional school where people teach how to make food or how to cook in big kitchen, in industrial kitchens," he said. Kauhajoki, with a population of about 15,000, is about 290km (180 miles) from the capital, Helsinki. The incident comes almost a year after another school shooting left nine people, including the gunman, dead in the Finnish town of Tuusala. Before that shooting, the gunman, 18-year-old student Pekka-Eric Auvinen, posted a video on YouTube titled "Jokela High School Massacre 11/7/2007," identifying the date and location of the attack. "All these memories are being brought back and people are asking the question, 'Why again?' " Sipila said. Finland enjoys a strong tradition of hunting and has a high proportion of gun ownership, with 2 million firearms owned in a nation of 5 million people.
If Pharrell Williams lived by Coco Chanel's rule and removed one accessory before leaving for the Grammy Awards Sunday, we all would have been worse for the wear. The producer/singer/songwriter showed up in a hat that became the conversation piece on a night when the conversation should have been about the music. Somehow, Pharrell's hat out-performed Taylor Swift, Willie Nelson, Imagine Dragons and Kendrick Lamar combined. When the artist first arrived on the red carpet, we couldn't wrap our minds -- nay, our eyes -- around what we were seeing. The headgear seemed to be as tall as it was wide, and we couldn't tell if Pharrell was channeling Smokey the Bear: Curious George's hat-loving companion: Or was just a devoted fan of Arby's. Of course it didn't take long until Pharrell's Hat got its own Twitter account. In the end, what appeared to be a fashion faux pas turned into a style win by the end of the night. Beyoncé's hair during her opening performance of "Drunk In Love"? That's another story. The superstar took the stage with a short hairstyle of wet waves -- an obvious reference to the hair she wears in the music video for the song. But Twitter took one look at the water-logged locks and went wild: We don't think Queen Bey suffered as much criticism as Madonna did, though. While the 55-year-old mom explained that her black suit, hat and cane were chosen by her son, David (who wore a matching outfit), that didn't make the armchair fashionistas any kinder. But, for all the talk about their outfits, all three artists walked away with bigger accomplishments last night. Beyoncé stunned on the red carpet and off it with her performance, Pharrell walked away with the producer of the year (non-classical) Grammy award, and Madge helped marry off 33 couples -- yes, 33! -- during a performance of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' "Same Love."

one of the biggest dates in the car enthusiast's diary -- will be a plug-in hybrid Lamborghini, Ferrari 458 Speciale, Mercedes AMG GT, and a five-door MINI. Manufacturers will unveil around 100 new models and designs, three times more than at the last show two years ago. Europe, while still fragile, has shaken off the financial crisis and the auto industry has seen a 6% boost in car sales so far this year, to 8.3 million. It's the largest increase since the crisis began in 2007. Recovery faces hurdles European sales were badly damaged by the recession, as people who already owned a vehicle put off buying a new one to cut their spending. New car registrations plummeted throughout Europe, with its most troubled economies facing the biggest drops: Registrations declined 80% in Greece, 57% in Spain and 53% in Portugal. But as sales have picked up, geopolitical pressures have put the industry under renewed strain. The West's trade war with Russia has had a significant knock-on effect, and sales are expected to slow in the year's final months. Before the Ukraine crisis, Russia was tracking to become Europe's largest car market, expected to surpass the UK and Germany by 2016. Instead, analysts expect that sales this year will decline between 8% and 12% this year. Latest monthly figures, from the Association of European Businesses, show sales in Russia plummeted 25.8% in August compared to last year. Efficiency first While recent gains have lent an upbeat atmosphere to this year's show, long-terms trends make for miserable reading. Car sales in Europe are nearly one fifth below the peak of late 2000s, and manufacturers are being forced to look for new growth areas. More efficient, hybrid and electric cars are seen as central to growth and a "technology race" is underway between European brands, according to Felix Kuhnert, PWC's head of European automotive industry division. New, "greener" hybrid models are expected to be among the show's most coveted creations. Lamborghini is unveiling its first ever plug-in hybrid supercar, the 910 horsepower Asterion, which boasts a V10 engine and three electric motors. Japanese luxury brand Infiniti will reveal plans for its flagship sedan, the hybrid Infiniti Q80. Jaguar will premier its XE, the most fuel-efficient of its stable to date. And Porsche is bringing a new plug-in hybrid version of its premium SUV Cayenne. European manufacturers are plunging money into research and development initiatives towards alternative drivetrains, lightweight construction, and other efficiency technologies, as they bid to attract new customers, Kuhner said. According to Kuhnert, the "old and inefficient" cars clogging up Europe's highways will be replaced "as soon as the economic outlook in each country becomes more positive." Focus on Asia Industry focus has also turned to Asia, as the middle classes boom and spending power increases. China is proving an attractive market for car manufacturers, despite concerns around the introduction of quotas and restrictions on new car registrations to combat pollution. The numbers are impressive: BMW sales in China were up 23% in the first half of 2014, pushing the group's sales in the period to 1 million. But the growth in Asia will not be driven by China alone.  Sales in Indonesia and Thailand are increasing with Indonesia's new car sales doubling between 2007 and 2012 and staying strong since. Many car makers have also moved parts of their production to Asia, in a bid to cut costs by producing where they sell.
A "lost" Beatles track recorded in 1967 and performed just once in public could finally be released, according to Paul McCartney. Beatles Paul McCartney, left, and Ringo Starr, right, with Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. "Carnival of Light" -- a 14-minute experimental track recorded at the height of the Beatles' musical experimentations with psychedelia and inspired by avant-garde composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen -- has long been considered too adventurous for mainstream audiences. In an interview for BBC radio, McCartney said his bandmates and their producer George Martin had vetoed its inclusion on the exhaustive 1990s "Anthology" collection, according to UK's The Observer newspaper. McCartney confirmed he still owned the master tapes, adding that he suspected "the time has come for it to get its moment," The Observer reported. "I like it because it's the Beatles free, going off piste," McCartney said. Almost everything recorded by the Beatles from their early days in Liverpool and Hamburg to their break-up in 1970 has been released to meet insatiable public appetite for anything to do with the legendary Liverpool quartet. In the 40 years since its recording, "Carnival of Light" has acquired near mythical status among Beatles fans who argue that the existence of the track provides evidence of the group's experimental ambitions beyond their commercially successfully pop career. The improvised work features distorted electric guitars, discordant sound effects, a church organ and gargling interspersed with McCartney and John Lennon shouting random phrases like "Barcelona" and "Are you all right?" McCartney would need the consent of Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and George Harrison's widow, Olivia Harrison, to release the track.
One summer day back in 2008, fisherman Ali Omar went to see Daniela Bleattler, a Swiss photographer living in Lamu, the beautiful island off the Kenyan coast. Struggling to make a living, Omar asked Bleattler if she had a job for him. Bleattler didn't, but asked him instead whether he could help her find any "tanga," the old sails from the traditional dhows that she loved. A couple of days later, the local fisherman returned with a magnificent brownish old sail, weathered by years of salt and storms from navigating the Indian Ocean waters. "It had a big hole in the center created by the wind and the old age of the material," remembers Bleattler, who at the time had just come out of a relationship. "I just laughed and said to him, 'if I do a big red heart around it, this will look just like my broken heart at the moment.'" So Omar left again to return this time with tins of red and black paint he used for his dhow. Together, they started painting a big red heart around the hole; once done, Bleattler dipped the brush into the black paint and added the words "Love Again Forever Whatever." Read this: Fishing craft to foosball tables, furniture to float your boat "We looked at it and we just loved it so much," says Bleattler. "I said I think we should frame it and put in the shop of a friend of mine." Less than two hours later, an American couple walked into the art store and stood in front of the broken heart holding hands. "They said 'that is beautiful, how much is it?'" recalls Bleattler. "I had no idea and I just kind of said a (very expensive) price but they said 'well, we want it" -- it started exactly like this." Ali Lamu What started was Ali Lamu, a business launched by Omar and Bleattler producing anything from whimsical paintings and high-end handbags to beautiful bed covers and cushions. Six years after their first sale, they have sold several broken hearts -- as well as other designs -- to customers from all over the world. Everything is handmade, created from old fishing material and whatever washes up on the shores of Lamu. "We are making more and more," says Bleattler. "We are actually in the process of thinking wider and bigger." Read this: Artist's spectacular glasses 'give trash a second chance' Ali Lamu, which is also the name some locals use for Omar, has 34 permanent staff and sometimes employs as many as 70 people. The business has a couple of workshops on the island but most of the craftsmanship is done in the artisans' homes. These are people who are usually Omar's family members, friends and other local fishermen. "Ali's family is happy because of this business because they all have a job from this company." says Juma Kilonzo, a friend and artisan. "We are the friends so we are close now like brothers," he adds. "So we also depend on this company." "Wake Up And Love" The artisans also paint thoughtful and uplifting messages on many of their designs, promoting love, peace and care for the environment -- slogans like "Wake Up And Love," "The Only Way to Save The World Is With My Heart" and "Heart That Loves Never Gets Old." "I just close my eyes and see what the day brings," says Bleattler, describing where she draws inspiration for the messages adorning Ali Lamu's one-of-a-kind creations. "Depending on the mood of the day," she continues, "what is going on around the world and the people around me -- the fishermen, the people I'm working with are my big inspiration, so it's from them I find all these sayings." The company sells its designs from a small boutique on Lamu, mostly to tourists. But one of the main challenges for the business has been a drop in the number of people visiting the stunning island recently. Lamu, which is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, is very close to Somalia and has previously been targeted in terror attacks. Watch this: Lamu deals with the tourism blues "We do survive because of exports, otherwise we wouldn't make it," says Bleattler. In hopes of attracting a bigger clientele, they've put themselves online so that people from all over the world can see their works and make custom orders. "In 10 years I hope Ali Lamu can be all over the world," says Omar. "So my company has a really good life."
Tiger Woods has changed his cell phone number and is not talking to some of his famous friends, NBA legend Charles Barkley said, following Woods' sex scandal that erupted last month. Barkley and filmmaker Spike Lee talked about their concern for the golfer during the taping of a one-hour special -- "With All Due Respect" -- to air Sunday on HLN, a CNN sister network. "I think when you have these fires in your life, as I call them, you need to talk to somebody else who is famous who [has] been through things in their life," Barkley said. "I don't think you can talk about it to your family and friends, because your family and friends, they're not famous." Lee said he had hoped Barkley or retired NBA star Michael Jordan could counsel Woods on how to survive the crisis. "He's insulated," Lee said. "If Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan can't get to him, and those are his boys, then other people are making bad moves." Woods, in a written statement that acknowledged "my infidelity," announced last week that he is taking "an indefinite break" from professional golf. The 33-year-old golfer, who tops the sport's world rankings, has been mired in controversy since he crashed his car outside his Florida mansion in late November. The crash prompted authorities to cite him for careless driving and fine him $164.
Eight children and three women died in eastern Afghanistan when NATO-led forces bombarded houses, a provincial official told CNN Thursday. The incident took place Wednesday in Khost province's Domandera district, according to Khost upper house member and foreign relations chief Arifullah Pashton. There was no immediate reaction from NATO's International Security Assistance Force about civilian casualties in Khost. But ISAF said it was investigating allegations of civilian casualties in an airstrike targeting an insurgent in Ghazni province, in the southeast. Pashton said hundreds of people in the district demonstrated against the alliance Thursday and chanted, "Death to the United States" and "Death to NATO." Civilian casualties in the war between coalition forces and militants have generated grass-roots anger toward the combatants, and ISAF has been working for years to tackle the problem.
An afternoon at an Oklahoma City water park turned unpleasant for visitors seeking a break from the blazing sun Wednesday. Three women at the Whitewater Bay Water Park in Oklahoma were transported to a hospital after sustaining injuries from debris flung in a sudden summer storm. "A gust of wind and a quick deluge of rain caused the injuries," said Lara O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Emergency Medical Service Authority. "It happened so abruptly it took the Whitewater Bay swimmers by surprise, but the weather is, in a way, a welcome relief because we were predicted to get up to 113 here." The injuries sustained were minor and the victims were in good condition as of Wednesday evening. O'Leary said the water park was packed Wednesday with visitors. Paramedics have responded to 269 heat-related emergencies and taken 174 people to area hospitals since a heat advisory was issued on June 17, she said. The heat wave is taking a deadly toll across the nation, particularly on athletes, as two football players and a coach died during summer football practices this week. DonTeria Searcy, a 16-year-old high school student, died Tuesday after he passed out after a morning practice at a Florida football camp, the local sheriff's department said. Another 16-year-old student, Forrest Jones, died Tuesday in a hospital after he passed out during a football practice at an Atlanta-area high school, school administrators said. And on Monday in Texas, Wade McLain, 55, an assistant football coach, collapsed during a morning practice and heat was ruled as a factor in his death, the local medical examiner's office said. The heat wave, now in its second month, is responsible for record-setting electricity use in Texas and dozens of deaths across the U.S. heartland. But this time is especially tough for young football players who don heavy equipment and brave rising temperatures while practicing. "It is tough and this was an unfortunate incident for us," said J.D. Hardin, a spokesman for Georgia's Henry County School District, which oversees Jones' high school.  "But our coaches have a lot of ways to deal with this. We try to hydrate the players and if they have to move the practices to the morning, I know they will." On Wednesday, Philadelphia Eagles player Mike Patterson suffered a seizure and collapsed during morning practice, but it was not clear what caused the seizure, the team said. "Patterson was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital where he is being tested to see why he experienced the seizure. Patterson has had no complications from the seizure," the football team said on its website. The team's head athletic trainer, Rick Burkholder, said "there is nothing in Patterson's medical history to indicate that he is predisposed to having a seizure," according to the team website. After Patterson, a veteran defensive lineman, lost consciousness, other teammates tried to shield him from the sun while medics helped him, the football team said. The temperature was about 80 degrees during the Eagles' morning practice. Temperatures reached a record high in Little Rock, Arkansas, Wednesday, soaring to a scalding 114 degrees. It's the hottest day on record for the city, according to CNN affiliate KLRT-TV.  Officials restricted high school football practices to three hours after four student athletes were hospitalized with dehydration, KLRT-TV said. Meanwhile, Texas set a new record for electricity demand Tuesday afternoon, breaking a mark established a day earlier. "Due to the high temperatures and high electricity usage expected this week, we are continuing to request that consumers and businesses reduce their electricity use during peak electricity hours ... for the remainder of the week," said Kent Saathoff of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state's power grid. The council is forecasting a third straight day of record demand on Wednesday. Though exact nationwide figures for heat-related deaths were not immediately available, blistering temperatures have been blamed for at least 22 deaths in Texas and Oklahoma, authorities said Wednesday. Heat was a factor in 20 deaths in Maricopa County in Phoenix, authorities said. Some school kids in Oklahoma City were dealing with the rising temperatures as 94 classes were without air conditioning Wednesday, said Tierney Cook-Tinnin, spokeswoman for Oklahoma City Public Schools. The school system changed its schedule this year so that students came earlier, starting on Monday, the spokeswoman said. The children have been moved out of the classrooms that did not have air conditioning and staff was frantically trying to fix the problem, Cook-Tinnin said. "We've hired outside contractors to help us catch up," she said. Wednesday marked the 33rd straight day of 100-plus-degree temperatures in Dallas.

The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is "pretty excited" but a little tired. Kavya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, reacts to winning the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night. "This has been my dream for so long; I've always wanted to win the bee," Kavya Shivashankar, 13, of Olathe, Kansas, told CNN. "I was just really excited when I was able to go up and spell the last word." The eighth-grader won $40,000 in cash and prizes for nailing the final word, "Laodicean," which means lukewarm or indifferent, particularly in matters of politics or religion. This year's bee -- an event that has skyrocketed in popularity thanks to exposure on television and in movies -- started Tuesday in Washington with a record 293 spellers. Kavya endured 15 rounds. In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.  Watch the poised winner describe the thrill » As she spelled words such as "phoresy," "hydrargyrum" and "huisache," she calmly went through the routine of asking each word's pronunciation, origin and roots before ticking their spellings off for the judges. "I focus so much on my word; I don't really pay attention to all the cameras and photographers and all the media in front of me," she said Friday. Kavya's father, who is her spelling coach, would tap his foot in time as she spelled the words, and at one point he appeared so confident that he waved to someone while his daughter was in the middle of spelling a word. Second-place finisher Tim Ruiter of Reston, Virginia, bowed out after misspelling "Maecenas," meaning a generous patron of the arts. Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year. "It was such a big part of my life, and I love doing it," she said. However, she may someday have a new role in the competition. "If my [little] sister gets to D.C. sometime soon, I'd really love to help and coach her," she said. Kavya attends California Trail Junior High School in the Kansas City suburb. Her hobbies include swimming, cycling and traditional Indian dance, according to the contest's Web site. She plans on becoming a neurosurgeon. The first National Spelling Bee took place in 1925, with five contestants. CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.
There is a hidden revolution at work that can transform the lives of a billion of the poorest people on the planet. The dream of health for all, even the poorest of the poor, can become a reality because of recent breakthroughs in technology and health systems. Scientific results that our Millennium Villages Project team published this week in The Lancet, coupled with broader trends around the world, should be a wake-up call: We can end the deaths of millions of young children and mothers each year by building on recent innovations. In 2006, the Millennium Villages Project and impoverished communities around Africa jointly embarked upon the fight against extreme poverty, hunger and disease. The idea was to use low-cost, cutting-edge technologies to overcome ancient scourges like malaria and mothers dying in childbirth. Today, there is no deep mystery about what to do to stop these deaths, since the diagnostic tests, medicines and procedures are known. The challenge is to scale up these life-saving approaches. In four years, starting from conditions of massive death tolls and a lack of health services, the Millennium Villages were able to reduce the deaths of children under 5-years-old by around 22%. The progress is continuing as low-cost health services expand. The lessons extend far beyond this specific project. Poor children die of three main categories of disease: infections, nutritional deficiencies and conditions around childbirth. The technologies and procedures to fight all these causes of death are improving dramatically. Therein lies a great hope. Consider malaria, one of the biggest killers of children in Africa. A dozen years ago, all seemed lost: The standard medicine had lost its efficacy as the parasite became resistant; insecticide-treated bed nets were little used because they had to be regularly retreated with the insecticide, a practical burden that poor villages could not manage; and diagnosis required that the mother and sick child trek to a distant clinic in the desperate hope the clinic had a functioning laboratory. Now all this has changed. A new generation of low-cost and highly effective medicines has been deployed. The nets now last five years without the need for retreatment. A trained village-based worker, as part of an expanded health system, can make the diagnosis at the household using a simple rapid test, without the need for a life-and-death journey to a distant clinic. The Millennium Villages have slashed malaria deaths, but much more to the point, malaria deaths are falling sharply across Africa, down by around one-third from their peak roughly a decade ago. The advances are widespread. New vaccines can fight diarrheal and respiratory diseases that have traditionally killed vast numbers of children. Thanks to vaccines, deaths from measles have plummeted, and polio is on the verge of eradication. New medical procedures can end the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to newborn. Technologies to support higher farm production and low-cost nutritional supplements can bolster inadequate diets. Perhaps most important, information can flow through even the remotest of villages, thanks to the massive increase in mobile telephones across regions that just a few years ago had no phones at all. The spread of mobile phones may mark the fastest global uptake of a technology in history. From a few million mobile phone subscribers worldwide in 1990, the number has climbed to more than 6 billion today, with more than 250 million subscribers in Africa. Mobile connectivity and the spread of wireless broadband are greatly strengthening rural health systems. In all of the Millennium Villages, and in more and more villages around the continent, lay community workers are bringing health services from the clinics right to the community. Mobile phones are critical in supporting these outreach workers, enabling them to call the doctors and nurses for advice, summon an ambulance or connect to a computerized expert system via text messaging. The big picture is thrilling. Globally, deaths of young children are falling. In 1990, the worldwide deaths of children under 5 totaled around 12.5 million. By 2010, the deaths were down to around 7.6 million. Yet this technology-based revolution in human well-being is at the risk of stalling. The improvements required international help to support the expansion of services in the poorest regions. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and Malaria and the U.S. PEPFAR initiative to fight AIDS exemplify the new kinds of support introduced during the past decade. Total funding for primary health care in the poorest countries has risen by roughly $15 billion per year from the low levels of aid a dozen years back. That's a good sum, but modest in the scheme of things, amounting to around $15 per person per year from the high-income countries, with a combined population of 1 billion. It's about half the support needed to complete the job. Alarmingly, the funding has come to a standstill and has even started to decline. The United States and Europe claim they can't afford to do more because of budget crises, but the needed sums could be filled many times over just by ending the loopholes that allow the richest companies to park their profits in Caribbean tax havens. If children continue to die by the millions, it will be the result of misguided priorities, not true budget limits. Instead of making excuses for lives lost, let us celebrate the remarkable progress we are making and commit ourselves to finishing this historic and worthy task.

and eventually, to love -- fruits and vegetables. Most importantly, she eliminated a lot of guilt by realizing that eating something unhealthy didn't equal failure. "In the past, if I ate what I considered non-diet food, I thought I had ruined everything, and I would quit whatever diet I was on," Durrant said. "Now I know that I can still occasionally splurge, attend celebrations, go to restaurants ... because I have learned how to choose something healthy anywhere I go." She would go on to lose 150 pounds. In the first couple of months, Durrant's low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol dropped 37 points as she made more positive changes to her eating habits and began to spend more time in the gym. This health change was a major landmark in preventing the heart attack that her doctor had presented as a very real threat. But Durrant was not done making changes. From the very beginning, becoming physically strong was just as important to Durrant as losing a lot of weight. In January 2014, she made a New Year's resolution to go to the gym every day for a year. She has stayed faithful so far. "Even if I'm out of town I make sure to go before I leave or I rush back to get in my workout before midnight," she said. "I feel unstoppable." Durrant has fitness equipment at home that she uses as well: a punching bag, an ab lounger, hand weights, kettlebells and workout DVDs. She tries to get in about five miles of cardio every day, as well as upper and lower body weight exercises. She has recently discovered a passion for weightlifting and bench pressing. "I am very proud of my muscles," she said. "I stare at them all the time." Durrant's boyfriend, Joe Goshen, has been her biggest cheerleader. He said she's always been beautiful, but she "now has a million different smiles, each one more beautiful than the last." She weighs 213 pounds and is down to a size 12. Her ultimate goal is to weigh "150 pounds of muscle." Although Durrant has changed most dramatically on the outside, she likes to acknowledge the internal changes as well. "I am not afraid of what people think of me. I am not afraid of social situations," she said. "Basically, I am not afraid." She said her newfound self-confidence has really helped her focus on the importance of even the smallest moment. "When the weekend comes, I'm up with the birds and ready to get out of the house and make every moment count, instead of lying in bed with no energy, watching TV and eating." Durrant decided to create a Facebook page called "Get Down with Dani" to both inspire others and to keep herself accountable for achieving her weight loss goals. "I have had the pleasure of meeting the strongest people that I've ever known," she said. "They have embraced me every step of my journey and allowed me to inspire and motivate them to start their own weight loss journeys." Initially, Durrant said she challenged her followers to work out with her every day for a month, and more than 300 people joined her in accomplishing that goal. "Now I have a challenge group with thousands of women, and a few good men, who are all 'Down with Dani' and excited for every new challenge that I give them," she said. "We have made weight loss fun." She said it's an amazing feeling to be the one doing the inspiring and motivating, when two years ago, "all I wanted to do was hide in a corner and cry." "My struggle with obesity is the one thing in life that I always failed at," she said. "To become an inspiration at your greatest failure, that is priceless."
For the second time in as many years -- after going 46 years with the same coach, Joe Paterno -- Penn State has named a new man to helm its storied football program. James Franklin, 41, was announced Saturday as the Nittany Lions' next football coach, replacing Bill O'Brien, who was hired in January 2012 and recently left to become head coach of the NFL's Houston Texans. "I'm excited to come home," said Franklin, who had led Vanderbilt University's football team the last three years but originally hails from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. "I'm a Pennsylvania boy with a Penn State heart." A former assistant coach at the University of Maryland and Kansas State University, Franklin took over a Vanderbilt team that went 2-10 in 2010 and led them to a 24-15 record and three straight bowl appearances. Franklin joins a program that is still rocked, in many ways, by fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. In addition to leading to Sandusky's conviction on 45 counts involving 10 young victims, the ordeal led to cover-up allegations and criminal charges involving three former Penn State administrators, including one-time President Graham Spanier. And as the scandal was first unfolding, Paterno was ousted as the football team's coach. He died a short time later. The NCAA imposed harsh sanctions on Penn State in the wake of what happened, including scholarship reductions, a post-season ban, a $60-million fine and 13 years of vacated wins. The Nittany Lions' team nonetheless surprised many with its performance under O'Brien, finishing 8-4 in 2012 and 7-5 this season. But there remained a perception that Paterno supporters weren't fully supportive of the new coach, with reports that sentiment played some part in O'Brien's exit. Paterno's widow, Sue, released a statement Saturday welcoming Franklin -- who described the late coach as the "great Joe Paterno" during Saturday's press conference. "His deep ties to Pennsylvania and his exceptional coaching record have prepared him well for his new position," Sue Paterno said. "We wish Coach Franklin great success and we know he will find broad support and encouragement from Penn Staters everywhere." The university's outgoing president, Rodney Erickson, said Franklin's hire followed what he called "a careful and deliberate search process." "Our program requires a very special kind of leader," Erickson said of the dual commitment for excellence on the field, the classroom and in the community. "...I believe we have found the right person." CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.
Next week's episode of Parks and Recreation is going to have a VIP: the VP. Joe Biden — yes, the very guy who was re-elected Vice President of the United States — will guest-star in the Nov. 15 installment of Parks and Recreation, EW has learned. His cameo occurs at the beginning of the episode, in which former Congressional campaign manager Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) takes fiancée/City Councilwoman Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), to the White House to meet America's No. 2, who has long been her No. 1 crush. (As Leslie once noted, her ideal man has "the brains of George Clooney and the body of Joe Biden.") Parks scored camera time with Biden in July when the show traveled to Washington, D.C. to film its season 5 premiere, which featured appearances by Senators Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe, and John McCain. How big of a casting coup was Biden for NBC's small-town government comedy? "Given that Eleanor Roosevelt and Bella Abzug are no longer with us, this is probably no. 1," quips executive producer Michael Schur. "[Leslie] has a lot of female heroes that cross party lines. She has a lot of social figures that she considers heroes, but the funniest hero is Joe Biden. There's an episode last season where she says, 'Joe Biden is on my celebrity sex list — well, he is my celebrity sex list'... It was amazing to have her meet Olympia Snowe and Barbara Boxer because that meant something to her politically. But this transcends that. She's meeting the man that she's in love with on some deep level. It was a bigger deal to us in some ways that she meet Joe Biden than it was that she meet Barack Obama." (Obama, by the way, has revealed that he watches Parks with his family, by the way. "It's a very amazing and weird thing to find out that the President watches your show," marvels Schur.) Once the producers committed to shooting an episode in D.C., the process of landing Biden was "so much less difficult than we ever possibly imagined," says Schur, noting: "His staff really loves the show, and he apparently had watched the show with his family and his family liked it... The hardest part was keeping it secret for so long because there's all these FEC rules and equal-time rules. We couldn't air it before the election because it was the equivalent of a campaign contribution to advertise for one candidate." The Biden-Knope summit, a surprise "engagement present" from Ben, lasts less than a minute and was written in a manner that would work regardless of the election's outcome. "We did not in any way want the moment to be a political issue — we treated it in the writing and the execution like our main character was meeting her hero," says Schur. (He notes that the writers did pen an addendum to the scene in the event of an Obama-Biden loss or a "weird Florida disaster tie.") The meeting takes place in the Vice President's Ceremonial Office in the White House-adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with Biden flanked by his real-life staff. "They have a conversation where she does what you would imagine Leslie Knope would do when meeting Joe Biden, which is she loses control of herself a little bit," hints Schur. "She gets really giggly and goofy around him." When the Parks crew set up in his office to shoot the scene, Biden happened to be tied up in a meeting with... President Barack Obama. Then "Obama got on Marine One and flew away, and Biden walked across the executive building and we shot the scene," says Schur. "It was really cool: You go this way and get on a helicopter that will take you to some incredibly important thing, and you come this way and shoot a scene with Amy Poehler." The Veep handled his scene like a pro, even ad-libbing a response to a crazy Leslie retort that wound up in the final cut of the episode. "He was very nice and charming," reports Schur. "He was clearly a big fan of Amy. It was the day the Emmy nominations came out and when he walked through the door he congratulated her on her Emmy nomination... He said some very nice things about the show and talked about how the pro-public service message was meaningful." While Schur & co. were thrilled to venture onto hallowed Washington ground, they aren't plotting the next great political cameo right now: "Since the beginning of the show, Joe Biden has been the No. 1 guy, so in terms of her achievements or personal milestones we'll have to go in a different direction," he says. "She'll have to get her thrills elsewhere." See original story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. All rights reserved.
It's all tied up in Texas. Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a tight race in Texas. A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas, which holds primaries March 4. In the survey, out Monday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party's nominee, with 48 percent backing Obama. But taking into account the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 4½ percentage points for Democratic respondents, the race is a virtual tie.  Watch Democrats target Texas. » Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even. Map: National and state polling "One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options," says CNN polling director Keating Holland. "Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination, and they don't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues. "Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly, those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama." Many political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Clinton. Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates, 193 of which are at stake in Texas. The new survey indicates Arizona Sen. John McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination. Among Republicans, 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee. Thirty-two percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Ron Paul. The poll's sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday. Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas, including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters. McCain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity. The poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush, the current president's father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston.  Watch McCain get a big boost » But McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters. Just last week, McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary, according to exit polls. The new survey, though, suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas. "It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans," Holland said. "McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary. The McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher, but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents, as has happened in several states in the past few weeks." Texas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues, but the poll suggests they do agree on what's the most important issue. Thirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president. The second most important issue for Democrats was health care, at 23 percent, followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent, illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent. Nineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue, putting it in second place, followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent. Sixty percent of Republicans say they'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing. That number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats. Likely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms. Seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee; an equal number feel the same way about Obama. Seventy-nine percent say it's likely Clinton can win the nomination; 82 percent say the same about Obama. The two candidates are essentially tied on immigration, Iraq and the economy, but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion. E-mail to a friend
The Federal Aviation Administration says registration records for as many as one-third of all private aircraft are out-of-date and inaccurate, and has begun the process of re-registering aircraft in the United States -- a task made more urgent by the threat posed by criminals and terrorists. Of the 357,000 registered aircraft in the United States, records for about 119,000 are believed to be out of date, with many of them believed to be junked or inactive aircraft, the FAA said. But the inaccurate records also could conceal criminal or even terrorist activity, say some security and aviation experts, who say it is critical that the FAA restore order to its records. To deal with the disarray, the FAA is in the process of canceling registration for all civil aircraft -- a category that includes virtually everything except military aircraft -- and requiring the owners to re-register. The re-registrations will be phased-in over three years, and aircraft owners will be required to renew the registrations every three years thereafter. "These improvements will give us more up-to-date registration data and better information about the state of the aviation industry," FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in July, when the rule took effect. The FAA has long grappled with getting a handle on its records, in recent years requiring owners to report the sale of aircraft, the scrapping or destruction of aircraft, or a change in mailing address. But many owners have not complied with those requirements, the FAA said. And many aircraft owners do not voluntarily update the database with other information, it said. The FAA's database identifies each aircraft by its registration number -- or "N" number, which is displayed on the plane's tail or fuselage -- its complete description, and the name and address of its registered owner. In seeking to upgrade the requirement three years ago, the FAA noted that various levels of law enforcement use the database in drug smuggling investigations and "their efforts now have expanded to include matters of homeland security." Proper records can assist investigators, aviation and security. Authorities routinely check the "N" number, or tail number, of suspicious planes, or planes that have entered restricted airspace. Just as importantly, an accurate database can help the FAA notify aircraft owners of safety-related information, such as Airworthiness Directives. The incomplete records are a security concern, but probably not a security problem," said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. "Most of these planes are probably right where they're supposed to be. The FAA has just lost track of them through lost paperwork or the database not being updated or the owners not answering the triennial survey that the FAA sends out," Dancy said. "So they're probably where they are supposed to be -- owned by the people the FAA last has record of. They just don't know that." Dancy said most aircraft owners recognize the need for accurate records, and that AOPA has tried to minimize the inconveniences associated with re-registration. "We offered some suggestions when the (new requirement was proposed) to try to make it a little less burdensome. But the fact of the matter is that the database is woefully out of date. It does need to be brought up to date. We thought it could be done without canceling current registrations. The FAA decided canceling was the best way. It's now the law of the land," he said.
First lady Michelle Obama invited more than 20 accomplished women to the White House on Wednesday, asking them to serve as mentors for area high school students. The women, along with the first lady, fanned out across the District of Columbia and surrounding suburbs in the afternoon visiting six local high schools encouraging the teenagers to follow their dreams and work hard to get there. "There is no magic to being here. You know, Barack and I were not born with silver spoons in our mouths and connections and money and resources. A lot of why we're where we are today is because we worked hard. We felt a deep passion for getting our education," the first lady told students at Ballou High school in Washington. She recalled having to get up as a child at 6:30 a.m. to ride a bus for an hour and a half to attend a better high school across town, for better preparation for college. "I know what it feels like to struggle to get the education that you need. In so many ways, I see myself in you all," Mrs. Obama shared. "And I want you to see yourselves in me, so that you're not looking at me just as the first lady of the United States." Mrs. Obama's events on Wednesday were scheduled as part of the end of National Women's History month. At Washington's Woodson High school, the four mentors included an Air Force general, a TV network executive, an actress and a gymnastics champion who all answered questions for more than 20 female students. "Good, old-fashioned hard work, that is the only thing that separates you from the crowd," said actress Rashida Jones, currently starring in the television series "Parks and Recreation." "Don't feel like you have to be defined by your circumstances," she added. Olympic gold medalist Dominique Dawes told the students that they should keep their attitudes positive. "Whenever I've gone into something with a negative attitude, something negative has come out of it," she said. The students had several questions for Gen. Dana Born, currently dean of the faculty at the Air Force Academy in Colorado, including what it was like to be one of the few women attending the Air Force Academy when she began several decades ago, and whether or not she had ever felt discrimination for being a woman. Born told the students that they needed to find their strength and then "practice, practice, practice" to reach success. Nina Lederman, vice president for program development at Lifetime Networks told the students that she had originally wanted to be an actress, but when it became apparent that she didn't have the acting talent, she shifted to a career in production. All 20 of the women mentors returned to the White House on Wednesday evening for dinner in the East Room with about 120 area students. CNN's Becky Brittain contributed to this report.
He came from Brazil to leading Spanish club Barcelona in a mega-bucks transfer touted as the new Lionel Messi. A series of niggling injuries this season put paid to any hope of Neymar living up to those high expectations, while the tax issues surrounding his complicated transfer from Santos cast a shadow over his new career in Europe. But the Brazilian, who has managed just nine league goals for Barcelona since touching down in Catalonia, is quick to rule out any correlation -- as some have done -- between those off-field issues and his form in a "Blaugrana" shirt this season. Which will be a relief to Brazil given how important Neymar is to their team and its hopes of winning the World Cup on home soil. "No, I don't think [it has affected my performances]. I'm used to leaving all those problems aside, I'm very relaxed when it comes to that," said Neymar, who was talking to CNN at a Castrol Footkhana event. "It's unpleasant when everyone is talking about things that are not true, but on the pitch it doesn't get in the way." True or not Neymar's club is being investigated over tax fraud regarding the transfer -- which Barcelona was forced to confirm actually totaled 86.2 million euros rather than the 57.1 million euros first announced -- while Sandro Rosell had to step down from his role as president as controversy over the deal intensified. Neymar's former club Santos, meanwhile, is unhappy with how the transfer fee was divided up -- with a large chunk having been paid to a company controlled by the player's father, Neymar Snr -- and has been seeking a bigger cut than the 17.1 million euros it originally received. Earlier this year Santos president Odilio Rodrigues reportedly criticized Neymar's father calling the deal he did with Barcelona "unacceptable." "I was very sad by the way that Santos handled this problem," Neymar, who has previously defended his father's role in the deal, said. "We hadn't done anything wrong. "The way that Santos handled this left me very sad, but what are you going to do? I can't answer for them, but I can speak for myself and my dad and say that we were truly saddened by how they wanted to resolve this." Santos was the club that molded Neymar into the player he is today. Making his debut in 2009 at the age of just 17 -- after coming through the youth ranks -- he helped lead the side to South American Copa Libertadores glory in 2011. "What I lived at Santos will stay with me for the rest of my life, they were wonderful years where I made history. I think that won't be erased," he said. "I'm sad with the board, I'm sad with who was in presidency -- with those I am upset. With the club, the fans, the players? No. "I have a lot of love for Santos, because it was a club where I was for 10 years, so my love will always be great." Like Neymar, Barcelona have had an up and down season, losing the Spanish Copa del Rey final to rivals Real Madrid and crashing out of the European Champions League at the quarterfinal stage, while a Spanish La Liga title looks unlikely. Neymar, though, insists he is enjoying life at the Camp Nou, which brings with it the privilege of playing alongside one of the finest players in the world -- Messi. "Everything is going really well, I'm very happy in this city," he said. "[Messi and I] haven't played all the games together but I think that the affinity that we have, that we've been creating, is very good. The relationship that we have, it's been wonderful. "Some people were saying we wouldn't get along, and that's been shown as being the opposite. He's a very relaxed guy, he's someone that I admire a lot." Despite the difficulties he has faced at Barcelona, Neymar still has the chance to achieve what could ultimately be his career's crowning glory. In six weeks' time, the 22-year-old and his Brazil teammates will step out onto the Arena de Sao Paulo field to open the 2014 World Cup against Croatia. The world's most successful footballing nation will be attempting to land the sport's biggest prize in its own backyard for the first time, roared on by an expectant set of supporters. "It's a dream that is about to happen and I hope that dream that I've always had, also happens with winning the title," said Neymar, who led Brazil to Confederations Cup glory in 2013 having been named player of the tournament in the process. "It's a dream to put on the Brazil shirt, even more so at a World Cup in my own country. For me it's a great satisfaction." Winning the World Cup in front of its own supporters would help banish the memories of the nation's darkest sporting hour -- letting slip a lead to allow Uruguay to become world champions in 1950, the last time the tournament was held in Brazil. Neymar, the national team's poster boy, is well aware of the pressure being piled on the shoulders of him and his teammates, especially given that they won the Confederations Cup in front of their own supporters last year. But the Barcelona man, who has represented his country on 48 occasions, says he and the rest of the Brazil squad are relishing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "I think that the responsibility that I have at the national team, like my teammates also have -- each of us has their responsibility. We are a group. One needs the help of the other and we are getting ready so that we can win the World Cup," he said. "So close to the World Cup, every time you see a Brazilian flag or you see some action of the national team, you hear people talking about the World Cup. I can imagine myself lifting the trophy."
German Bundesliga side Schalke have announced Huub Stevens as the replacement for recently-departed coach Ralf Rangnick, on the same day that former Danish international Michael Laudrup left his role as coach of Spanish club Real Mallorca. Rangnick, 53, guided Schalke to the semifinals of the European Champions League last season but left the Veltins Arena earlier this month, citing fatigue as his reason for leaving the club. Dutchman Stevens, 57, previously spent six years as Schalke coach between 1996 and 2002, guiding the Gelsenkirchen outfit to a UEFA Cup triumph against Italian giants Inter Milan in 1997. Stevens, who has also had spells in charge of Hertha Berlin, Hamburg and PSV Eindhoven, has signed a two-year deal. "Huub Stevens, who coached the Royal Blues from 1996 to 2002, has returned to his former stomping ground with immediate effect," read a statement on the club's official website. "Stevens has put pen to paper on a contract to 30 June 2013." Schalke currently sit fifth in Germany's top division, having won four and lost three of their opening seven matches. As Schalke appointed a new coach, Laudrup ended his one-year tenure in charge of Mallorca. Laudrup, who represented Denmark on 104 occasions, announced his decision to leave the club at a press conference on Tuesday. The former Spartak Moscow coach made the decision due to his relationship with club owner Lorenzo Serra Ferrer becoming damaged beyond repair. "This situation cannot continue like this," Laudrup, 47, said. "From now on, Mallorca will be whatever it is Serra Ferrer wants." Laudrup guided Mallorca to a 17th-place finish last season as the one-time Copa del Rey winners avoided relegation by just one point. The club sold star midfielder Jonathan de Guzman to Spanish rivals Villarreal in August and Laudrup saw his assistant Erik Larsen sacked on Monday. "Yesterday one of my assistants was fired," he said. "Once again, it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to find the peace required to work here. "The team is hurt by this situation. What we need is calm and I cannot go home every night, angry, disappointed. I have a family." Laudrup's final game in charge was a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad on Sunday, and his former charges travel to Osasuna on Saturday.
They are some of the biggest names in Hollywood, but even Susan Sarandon, Ethan Hawke and Dustin Hoffman have had their fair share of casting calamities they would rather forget. Mike Myers sabotaged some auditions for parts he didn't want. "Why not be nude even if it is a children's theatre?" CNN's The Screening Room has managed to persuade the cream of Hollywood to confess their tales of audition woe. The stars shudder at the memory of waiting in line, frantically trying to memorize lines handed to them moments before, all the while being assessed by critical strangers. Benicio del Toro recounts attending 50 or 60 auditions before getting a part and Quentin Tarantino told Eli Roth he "blew it" when he first auditioned for "Inglourious Basterds." While Catherine Keener remembers a cutting personal assessment: "You're not pretty enough." Here are some of their worst moments: Bill Nighy "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest." "Love Actually" "There was one that started out terrible, which was where I had to go to a disused tax office in Harrow [near London, England] very early in the morning and put on very tight velvet flared loon pants and a pair of crocodile four-inch- heeled platform shoes, and wear a sort of very small top that didn't meet my trousers, hair extensions and I had to karaoke to 'Smoke on the Water' by Deep Purple. It's a very lonely place. And I was 45 at the time..." Ethan Hawke "Before Sunset," "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" "I have had so many bad auditions. I have fallen on my ass. I have made a complete fool of myself. I auditioned for Robert Redford once and I was so starstruck I couldn't even speak. I had a mic wire at a screen test clipped to me and then I got kind of nervous and I paced in a circle and then took a step and tripped and fell on my face. You just have to forgive yourself and keep going on." Mike Myers "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," "Shrek" "I've had some bad auditions for some TV movies that were shooting in England where I just didn't want to be in them and offered them more obtuse [performances] ... I like to think of it as performance art. I didn't sabotage it, I was just woefully inappropriate, you know? I just thought, 'Why not be nude even if it is a children's theatre?" Catherine Keener "Being John Malkovich," "Synecdoche, New York" "You wouldn't believe some of the comments, assessments. But, they're really not meant personally. Like for example, 'You're not pretty enough.' For them it's just a fact. But for you it's like, 'Oh my God! I have to live with this.' You get a thicker skin about it, which you should because it isn't meant personally, but it's such a personal profession that you kind of have to get used to getting critiqued on things that you shouldn't even care about." Dustin Hoffman "Marathon Man," "Meet the Fockers" "The most famous casting director from New York, I was lucky enough to get an audition with her in the '60s. She did all the plays, all the Broadway plays. She is sitting across the desk saying her lines, and I am saying mine, and she stops and says, 'Come here. Bring your chair here, right next to me.' And I say, 'Why?' And she says, 'Because I can't hear you, and you have never been on the stage or on Broadway, and you are going to have to reach the last row.' I said, 'Yeah, I know. I have been studying acting for about seven years now, but I'm not on Broadway now, I'm just sitting in front of you.' So, she said, 'I know, but I couldn't hear you. That's why I asked you to sit next to me.' I said, 'Okay. Can you hear me now?' I was getting so angry. Well, at that point she said, 'Speak up,' and I screamed as loud as I could, every line after. She called my agent and said, 'If you ever send that maniac around here again I will never see another one of your clients.' I really lost it. Eli Roth "Death Proof," "Inglourious Basterds" "I left the casting of 'Hostel: Part II,' which Quentin [Tarantino] was a producer on to go and audition for his movie ['Inglourious Basterds'] and it was just a room with a camera. He wasn't even there and I was like, 'Where's Quentin?' They go 'He didn't leave his house today.' Anyways, I blew it. I did terribly and Quentin called me and starts making fun of me. He was like,'You were so bad in your audition, but I'll give you a callback. Come on.' Demi Moore "A Few Good Men," "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" "I auditioned for 'A Few Good Men' with Tom Cruise and Rob Reiner and when I went into that audition I was eight months pregnant ,so there is always kind of a lasting impression that I was playing this military officer with this gigantic belly. Obviously, it turned out well because I got the role but there was something quite odd about it." Roger Moore "Octopussy," "Curse of the Pink Panther" "I remember auditioning for one play, and the girl was awfully short and we were holding the book in our hands and I almost couldn't see her. I knew I wasn't going to get that part, I tried to make myself smaller and smaller so I could be closer her size and that didn't happen." Ramon Rodriguez  "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" "I met ['Transformers' director] Michael Bay in his office in Santa Monica for an hour and a half he had me running, jumping and diving all over his office and his furniture freaking out like I was reacting to robots, which is the strangest audition I have had by far. I left the room completely drenched in sweat and all I could say was, 'I better get this part.' It worked out and the stuff we did in the room was the stuff we did on set."
Ottawa (CNN)Canadian counterterrorism officials arrested and charged a man Monday, accusing him of conspiring with twin brothers in a terror plot. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced Monday that it had arrested Suliman Mohamed, 21, and charged him with participating in the activity of a terrorist group and conspiracy to participate in a terrorist activity. After making the arrest, Canada's national security team said in a statement that Mohamed's arrest was directly linked to the arrests of Ashton and Carlos Larmond, two Ottawa brothers accused of conspiring to commit terrorism offenses. The brothers were arrested Friday. The RCMP alleged Mohamed conspired to participate in terrorism with the Larmond brothers. "These recent arrests underscore the reality that there are individuals in Ontario and in Canada who have become radicalized to a violent ideology, and who are willing to act upon it," wrote Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan, criminal operations officer for the Ontario Division of the RCMP. After an investigation dating back to at least August 2014, the Larmond brothers, both 24, were arrested Friday in two different locations.  Ashton Larmond was arrested in Ottawa, but his brother Carlos was arrested at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, where police said he was intending to travel overseas for terrorist purposes. Carlos Larmond was charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group and with attempting to leave Canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad, a relatively new Canadian terrorism law. Through their lawyer, the brothers indicated they would be fighting the charges. The RCMP statement did not give details of allegations against the suspects. "I don't think we've been shown anything at this point," said Richard Addelman, the lawyer representing the Larmonds. It was not clear Monday night if Mohamed had retained an attorney. Canada's terrorism laws were amended in April 2013 to include an offense for anyone leaving or attempting to leave Canada for the purpose of committing a terrorist act abroad. Very few Canadians have been charged in this way and the outcome of this case will be closely watched by counterterrorism officials. "It's going to be a significant case, that's for sure," added Addelman. Neighbors in an east Ottawa neighborhood where Mohamed has lived said they did not immediately recognize him but indicated there had been police activity on the street all weekend long. Canada Parliament shooting: How it unfolded
The jury that cleared American student Amanda Knox of murder did so for lack of evidence proving she was guilty, the judge in the case said in legal paperwork published Thursday. "Even taken all together," the prosecution's evidence does not "prove in any way the guilt of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the crime of" killing British student Meredith Kercher, the judge wrote. Prosecutors will probably appeal the acquittal, prosecutor Giuliano Mignini told CNN on Thursday. Either side can appeal a conviction in Italy, but appeals cannot be filed before the judge publishes the jury's reasoning for its verdict. An appeal in the Knox case would be on narrow technical grounds only and would probably take a day or two. It is unlikely Knox would return to Italy from the United States for the appeal. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder in 2009 but cleared on appeal in October. Knox was 20 and Kercher was 21, studying at the university for foreign students in Perugia, Italy, when Kercher's semi-naked body was found November 2007 in the house they shared. Her throat had been slashed. Sollecito, 23 at the time, was Knox's boyfriend, studying computer science at another university in Perugia. The case gripped the attention of the public in the United States, Italy and Kercher's native Britain, where the tabloid press portrayed the defendant as femme fatale "Foxy Knoxy." A third man, Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of the killing. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her. Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman said in the paperwork published Thursday that it was not up to the jury to reconstruct what had happened. "What matters in reaching the ruling is only the lack of proof of guilt of the two defendants," he wrote. The jury was apparently convinced by a determined defense effort to discredit DNA evidence that played a role in the 2009 conviction. Knox's attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he was "fully satisfied" with the judge's report, known in Italian as a motivazione, or motivation. "We've always said that there was no evidence, that the first court ruling was based on probabilities and not facts," Dalla Vedova said. "The first ruling was a mistake, which has now been corrected, so we are very satisfied with it." Knox's family issued a brief statement Thursday saying the paperwork affirms "that Amanda had absolutely nothing to do with the tragic and terrible murder of Meredith Kercher." "Amanda and we are satisfied with the motivations and take heart in the strength of the judge's words and proclamation of her innocence," the family said in the statement. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome. CNN's Richard Allen Greene wrote the article in London.
Blasts of heavy machine-gun fire and explosions from airstrikes filled the air in Gaza early Sunday morning, hours after Israel rolled thousands of troops into the Palestinian territory. Israeli soldiers on the Israeli-Gaza border wait to enter Gaza on Saturday night. At least four Palestinians have been killed as a direct result of the ground assault, Palestinian medical sources said, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 460 since the conflict erupted December 27. The ground assault followed a weeklong campaign of airstrikes in what Israel says is an offensive to halt rocket attacks from Hamas militants in Gaza. "We want to create a situation where the civilian population in southern Israel is no longer on the receiving end of those deadly Hamas rockets," Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN. "We haven't articulated regime change as the goal of this operation. Our goal is to protect our people," Regev said. Israeli officials say four people have been killed and 59 wounded in Hamas rocket attacks in the past week. As night fell on the eighth day of the bloody conflict, both sides remained defiant, vowing to stand their ground and accusing the other of breaking a cease-fire that had been in place until last month.  Watch the conflict unfold on both sides » Not long after Israel's ground incursion began, Hamas vowed to "fight until the last breath" and warned Israel that "Gaza will be your cemetery." As the ground attack began, Hamas rockets continued to fly into southern Israel, with CNN reporters at the Israel-Gaza border seeing and hearing several of them. "We will not abandon the battlefield, and we will stay on the thorny course, and we will fight until the last breath," Hamas chief spokesman Ismail Radwan said in a statement on Palestinian network Al-Aqsa.  Watch statement from Hamas » The Israeli ground attack deepened a humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has been decried by international observers, including the United Nations. On Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, a spokesman said.  View reactions from world leaders » The spokesman said Ban "is convinced and alarmed that this escalation will inevitably increase the already heavy suffering of the affected civilian populations," according to a statement. Electricity, food and medical shortages already were a problem in the densely populated territory, concerns ramped up by the airstrikes. Taghreed El-Khodary, a New York Times writer in Gaza City, said that there was no electricity there Saturday and that she said she didn't know of any shelters set up by Hamas for residents.  Watch Times writer describe the humanitarian crisis in Gaza » Regev said Gaza's civilian population was not Israel's enemy. "In many ways, they are victims like us. Both the civilian population of southern Israel and the civilian population of the Gaza Strip have been victims of this terrible, extremist Hamas regime," Regev said.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour interview Regev » An Israeli airstrike hit a mosque in the northern Gaza village of Beit Lahiya on Saturday evening, killing 13 people and wounding 60, according to Palestinian medical sources.  Watch the chaos after the mosque attack » An Israeli attack earlier Saturday killed Azkariah al-Jamal, commander of Gaza City's rocket-launching squads, Palestinian and Israel Defense Forces sources said. Another airstrike killed two Hamas militants in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, Palestinian officials said. Israeli missiles hit 25 Hamas "outposts, training camps and rocket launching sites" Saturday morning, an IDF statement said.  Watch explosions in Gaza » The houses of two alleged Hamas terrorist operatives were also hit, the IDF said. One was the home of Azadin Hadad, described as the head of the Hamas military group in eastern Gaza City. The other, in Beit Lahiya, was used to store rocket-launching equipment and was the home of Ismail Renam, who "has a central role in the launching of Grad-type rockets against Israel," the IDF said. Meanwhile, Hamas militants launched 20 rockets from Gaza into Israel by late afternoon Saturday, IDF spokeswoman Maj. Avital Leibovich said. Rockets set a house on fire in Ashkelon, damaged a kibbutz dining hall and slightly wounded two people in an eight-story building in Ashdod, according to Israeli ambulance services. "We still see that Hamas is targeting Israeli civilians. Namely, we still did not reach the goal of crippling Hamas' launching capabilities," Leibovich said. CNN's Barbara Starr said top U.S. military leaders were aware in advance of Israel's plans to enter Gaza. The incursion began just hours after the European Union announced that a delegation is heading to the Middle East to meet with regional leaders and broker a cease-fire. A Middle East "Quartet" consisting of the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia is also trying to broker a truce. Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group that came into being in 1987, won by a landslide in parliamentary elections in Gaza in 2006. Months later, Hamas militants began attacking Israeli military posts and fighting with members of Fatah, the rival political party that controls other Palestinian territories. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared a state of emergency and dissolved the government in Gaza, although Hamas has had de facto control of the territory since then.
Two Nigerian labor groups suspended their nationwide strike Monday over the elimination of the country's fuel subsidy and urged demonstrators to go home "in order to save lives and in the interest of national survival. The Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress cited successes gained by demonstrators, including an announcement Monday by President Goodluck Jonathan slashing fuel prices, in its announcement suspending the strikes. "In the past eight days through strikes, mass rallies, shutdown, debates and street protests, Nigerians demonstrated clearly that they cannot be taken for granted and that sovereignty belongs to them," NLC President Abdulwahed Omar and Peter Esele, president of the Trade Union Congress, said in the statement. But a third organization, the Joint Action Front, issued a statement deploring the suspension and urging continued strikes and protests until the government agrees to restore gas prices to what they were before the government ended the subsidy. "Nigerians should not be discouraged by the abrupt and unwarranted suspension of strike by its Labour partner; neither should the militarization of the protest centers deter Nigerians in their resolve to rid the polity of this class of looters and profiteers that are responsible for mass poverty, unemployment, social insecurity and untold hardships of the majority of Nigerians," JAF Secretary Abiodun Aremu said in the statement. In an earlier statement on the group's blog, Aremu said the group and a related organization, the Labor and Civil Society Coalition, had decided Sunday that they would continue their strikes and mass protests after talks with the government failed. "However early this morning, our joint leadership advised Nigerians to continue the strike but (said they) should stay at home in view of the resolve by the Federal Government to unleash violence on Nigerians who want to exercise their right to protest and procession," Aremu said in the statement. The Joint Action Front is part of the National Labour Congress and has organized many of the protests and rallies against the government's decision to end the fuel subsidy. On Monday, the government deployed troops in Lagos, and military forces set up armed checkpoints at most key bridges and along major roads. Eyewitnesses told CNN that police and the army were not allowing protesters into demonstration zones, but there were no confirmed reports of violence. Scattered demonstrations began in Nigeria after Jonathan announced on January 1 that the government would end the popular fuel subsidy, which was widely seen by citizens as one of the few perks of living in the oil-rich but largely impoverished nation of more than 160 million people. The government has said the removal of subsidies would free up billions of dollars to boost the economy and improve the country's infrastructure. The removal caused the price of fuel and other goods to spike and became a rallying point for Nigerians angry over corruption and the alleged misuse of oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. Fuel that had cost about 65 nairas (40 cents) before the subsidy was lifted rose to 141 nairas (86 cents). On Monday, after more than a week of protests, Jonathan announced in a speech that the government would reduce fuel prices to 97 nairas (60 cents) per liter. He cited "the hardships being suffered by Nigerians." Aremu rejected the Nigerian government's concession and said his group would only accept a return to prices before the government cut the fuel subsidy. "The people have every right to tell the presidency and this class of looters and profiteers that Nigeria belongs to Nigerians," Aremu said. It was unclear Monday whether the Nigeria Labour Congress or the Trade Union Congress would accept the fuel-price cut and call for a permanent end to the strikes and protests. Last week, a major oil union, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, had threatened to halt production in solidarity with protesters if the two sides didn't reach an agreement. A move to halt production would reverberate on the global market. Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest crude exporter. Charlie Robertson, a chief economist at the global investment firm Renaissance Capital, said earlier this month that a subsidy removal could help Nigeria in the future. "If they're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform, too. If they do that, Nigeria's growth can be, instead of 7%-8% a year, 10% or 11%," Robertson said. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure; Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said Nigerians should not let the past determine the future. She said the goal now is to regain the citizens' trust and move forward. "They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward," she said. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report
It's 4 o'clock on a Sunday morning when a trail of figures dressed in white emerges from the deep darkness. Quietly, the summoned crowd makes its way down a cluster of ancient structures as the slow beat from traditional skin drums beckons. It's a common scene here in Lalibela, a small town in northern Ethiopia that's home to 11 spectacular churches carved both inside and out from a single rock some 900 years ago. The chiseled creations have turned this mountain town into a place of pride and pilgrimage for worshipers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, attracting 80,000 to 100,000 visitors every year. "It is one of the very important places for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church people," says local guide Fikru Woldegiorgis, who's lived here most of his life. "There is a belief that Lalibela pilgrims share the same blessing as pilgrims to Jerusalem," he explains. "They have to come at least once in a lifetime." And they come from all over. Even though Lalibela sits in a remote region of Ethiopia, the faithful will walk for days, even weeks, to get here, many of them traversing the rugged mountains barefoot. Amongst them, blind men and women and people with disabilities also join the pilgrimage, making their way along Lalibela's winding, hilly roads to reach the sacred site. "What makes the Lalibela churches important is that they are still in use," says Woldegiorgis. "It's not a museum; it's a living heritage. Every day, every morning, there is a service in all the churches." Brimming with spirituality Ethiopia is home to one of the oldest Christian churches in the world, dating back to the early fourth century. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church used to be a part of Egypt's Coptic Church, but established its own patriarch in 1959. Today, nearly two thirds of the East African country's population is Christian, with most belonging to the Orthodox Church. Read this: Will African coins rewrite Australian history? Nowhere does the spirituality of the church's followers echo louder than in Lalibela. The town is brimming with devotion; throughout the churches' compound, you'll find worshipers leaning against the structures, kissing the age-old rock walls, praying quietly or reading religious texts. "They come early to get the blessing -- because it's such a big deal, every inch of the place is packed," says Aba Gebreyesus, the priest who presides over all the churches in Lalibela. "People are so happy with the blessings they get here, they come here without any prompting and spend their nights and days at the church." Distinctive monuments The medieval structures were commissioned by King Lalibela, of the Zagwe Dynasty, which ruled much of the country back in the 12th century. There are several stories surrounding the creation of the churches, one of which says that humans worked during the day and angels would speed up the building overnight. Some historians say construction was completed at a remarkable pace, taking about 23 years. Watch this: Why do Rastafarians love Ethiopia? Carved out of volcanic tuff rock, the famous churches have been built in a variety of styles. Some of them were chiseled into the face of the rock, where others stand as isolated blocks, like the iconic church of Saint George, constructed in the shape of the cross. A complex and extensive system of drainage ditches, tunnels and subterranean passageways connects the underground structures. Alebachev Retta, an 86-year-old church scholar who has studied in some of Ethiopia's holiest cities, explains what makes these churches so distinctive. "They are different because they were built from the top down," he says. "Everywhere in the world, structures are built from the ground up," he adds. "There is nothing comparable in the world." Living legacy Thanks to their impressive architecture and rich influence on Ethiopian Christianity, the churches have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1978. Five years ago, UNESCO decided to erect protective coverings to shield four of the churches from the elements. The shelters may be unsightly, but experts say they are critical to preserving the integrity of the churches. In recent years, a conscious effort to develop Lalibela's infrastructure has also brought further attention to this remote place, leading to the arrival of even more pilgrims and tourists. Retta says he's seen positive changes in Lalibela over the years. He says he's especially content with how it's become a worldwide tourist destination. "One, because the country's culture should be shown, and secondly, many poor people in the area are being helped," he says. "Everyone is making a living through the tourism business. It's great; without the tourists, there is no salary for anyone. If the tourists stopped, everything will stop." But that doesn't seem likely, as visitors keep on coming to Lalibela's churches. And although the sacred sites provide a solid foundation for the faithful, it's the followers themselves that ultimately breathe life into these ancient rock walls.
Simon Monjack's death two months ago was caused by acute pneumonia and severe anemia, according to a Los Angeles County coroner spokesman. "Just like Brittany," Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said, referring to actress Brittany Murphy, Monjack's wife, who died five months earlier. Some prescription drugs were detected in his system, but not in lethal levels, Winter said. Sharon Murphy issued a statement saying the preliminary findings should "stop the reckless innuendos that my daughter and son-in-law misused any kind of prescription medications." "It is with great relief that Simon's preliminary autopsy findings have been released, so the media speculations can stop," Murphy said. "As I was sure of, just like my daughter Brittany, there was no kind of drug overdose." One more test will be conducted, at Monjack's family's request, before a full autopsy report is released in about two weeks, Winter said. Monjack, a 39-year-old British screenwriter, was found dead at his Hollywood home May 23, according to the coroner's office. Murphy, his wife of less than three years, died in the same home last December. Murphy, 32, died from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication, a coroner said. The drugs involved were legal and used to treat a respiratory infection, according to an autopsy. The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in films such as "Clueless," "8 Mile," "Don't Say a Word" and "Girl, Interrupted." She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie "Happy Feet" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series "King of the Hill."
It's a hot, sunny Sunday morning, and birds are chirping in the trees over the heads of children playing on swings and in a pile of sand in a small park in front of City Hall. Or what used to be City Hall, anyway. Today, it's a burned-out husk of a building, the ground around it thick with ash and crunchy with broken glass, official documents strewn around and covered with footprints. Windows are shattered. Walls are stained black by smoke and fire. A dozen or so young men lounge around on the front steps of the building, asserting that they are part of the militia of the Donetsk People's Republic. But they look more like drunks with nowhere else to go after a night out. But they're not the only ones hanging around the remains of City Hall in Mariupol, recently the scene of clashes between supporters of the central government and backers of either independence or union with Russia for this part of eastern Ukraine. Yevgeny Bulgakov, a steelworker, is here too, wearing his thick Ilyich factory work jacket despite the heat of the day. He's here to help re-establish order in the city, he said. And indeed, despite the destruction of City Hall, the scene is much calmer than it was a month ago, when the building stood behind a makeshift barricades of tires, bricks and paving stones. That's gone today. The only remnants are a coil of barbed wire discarded among spring flowers and a small pile of tires by the street corner. Did the steelworkers bring calm? Some are giving credit for the restoration of order here to the steelworkers. There are tens of thousands of them in this industrial city where factories spew brown and gray smoke along the road into town. About 11,000 of them signed up to help patrol Mariupol along with local police, according to the company MetInvest, which employs them. The patrols come alongside an agreement signed by a wide range of leaders in Mariupol to try to de-escalate the situation. The deal came five days after violence in the city left at least seven people dead and 40 wounded, according to Human Rights Watch. The steelworkers are backed by their boss, Donetsk-based billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, who came out against both independence and union with Russia last week. Many of them are paid for the time they patrol, MetInvest said. But steelworkers are not the only ones on patrol. They only make up about a third of the total volunteer force, locals say. And hard-core supporters of independence for the region don't give them credit for restoring order. A group of about a dozen steelworkers was jeered as several hundred supporters of independence gathered for a march Sunday to mark the killings on May 9 that seem to have been a turning point in the city. Hard questions for separatist leader But the separatist crowd also has hard questions for the local separatist military commander, Andrey Borisov, an angular man with a shaggy beard and close-cropped hair under a beret. They surrounded him and peppered him with questions as he smoked and sweated in the hot sun. He didn't seem to be able to say who's in control. "Who will govern? You will be the first one to come up to me when you don't have your pension paid. The transition of power is a complicated process," he said. And he admitted that the separatists need more men. "We need guys who are able to take arms and fight," he said to the crowd, composed mostly of people middle-aged and older, none of whom volunteered for the job. That could be a problem for the self-declared local political leader, Denis Kuzmenko. Kuzmenko vowed firmly Sunday that the people of Mariupol would not participate in Ukraine's presidential election scheduled to take place in a week. The friendly, slightly chubby man wore a pistol in a holster on his hip as he spoke to journalists outside his headquarters, a tightly secured brick police station taken over by the separatists. His words were firm. "We consider trying to open up a polling station and trying to establish an opportunity to vote as a provocation. We will treat it as such," he said. But can he carry out the threat? He all but admitted he doesn't have enough men to control the city when asked whether he needed the steelworkers to help maintain order. "Of course we need everyone," he said, saying there are 50,000 steelworkers in the area, and that the majority support independence. He denied there was a divide between "the steelworkers" and the people. "They are patrolling because they support the Donetsk People's Republic and they want order," he said. As Kuzmenko spoke, his security guard, a clean-cut man with shiny gray trousers, violet shirt and AK-47, came over to a journalist, tugged his arm and spoke English. "Our citizens are the steelworkers," he said. "It is the same."
A man and a woman have been charged by police in Italy after they were found having sex in a confession box, it was reported Wednesday. The Italian ANSA news agency said the young man and woman were taken into custody by police in the northern city of Cesena following a telephone complaint from a man attending morning Mass in the city's cathedral. Authorities were alerted after a parishoner heard "rustling and groaning" coming from inside the confession box and pulled back the curtains to reveal a goth-rock couple engaged in oral sex, ANSA said. The agency said the pair -- a 31-year-old laborer and a 32-year-old teacher -- defended their conduct saying: "We are atheists and for us, having sex in church is like doing it any other place." However, Bishop Antonio Lanfranchi of Cesena-Sarsina took said the couple's behavior was "an outrage of notable proportions which bespeaks unutterable squalor." He added that a special ceremony would be held to purify the confession box.
in this case, Congress Parliament member Abhijit Mukherjee -- could entangle himself with a remark against women protesting gang rape. He called them "dented and painted women" who go to discos, have little connection with ground realities and are making candlelight vigils fashionable. After an enormous backlash, he apologized and retracted his comments, but many are not satisfied and want his resignation Misogyny has long permeated our textbooks, our pedagogy and our parenting. In fact, it runs so deep that it reflects itself even in our linguistics. The Hindi phrase most commonly used to describe sexual violence or rape against women is "izzat lootna," which means "to steal the honor of." Another Hindi word used for rape, "balatkar" (or "bad act"), is considered so erudite and technical that it's barely ever used. (Its English equivalent would be "coitus" instead of "sex.") So, for the most part, we're stuck with "izzat lootna" -- and the necessary question: Why should a rapist be given so much credit? Rape is a criminal act of force and perverse subjugation. When a woman is raped, her most fundamental rights as a human being are violated. Yet, she is just as honorable as she ever was. Honor cannot be stolen. It can only be surrendered. Surely in the act of rape, it is the perpetrator, not the victim, who surrenders honor. The brave girl from Delhi died with her honor intact. Her rapists will live in ignominy. Unfortunately, in India rape is inextricably linked by men -- and women -- to shame: the ultimate desecration. Many victims are murdered by their rapists or choose to commit suicide. It is also not uncommon for the parents of rape victims to kill themselves. Thus, most victims don't speak up about what happened to them, lest their families be ostracized, lest they never find a husband or be shunned by their friends. About 10 months ago, I was offered a role of a young, urban woman who gets gang raped. The film explores how she chooses to deal with what happens to her. It is a very powerful script, and most of me wanted to accept the role immediately. But a gnawing part of me worried about how I'd be perceived by the general public were I to perform this role. Female sexuality in Hindi cinema is extremely fraught, especially because audiences seem unable to comprehend the distinction between what a role demands from an actor and that person's conduct offscreen. In the script the woman is attractive, confident and self aware; she'd had several consensual relationships with men and enjoyed her sexuality. Truth be told, her character is not far from me in real life. Still, in patriarchal, judgmental, misogynistic Indian society, these are labels most women are afraid to carry publicly. On top of this, the character gets raped. I was afraid to accept the role. Afraid of whether audiences and the media would think I was promiscuous, desecrated. Embarrassed at the prospect of saying I'm doing a film in which I get raped, lest aspersions be cast on my character. There lay, in my own mind, the seeds of the same misogyny that makes Mr. Mukherjee's remarks in the wake of the student's gang rape so deplorable. Seeds I had to uproot at once. I accepted the role. At the time I was offered the film, rape wasn't getting the sort of national attention it is getting right now. It was still a topic that made most people uncomfortable, a topic that women and men alike were not able to freely express their opinions on. That India's young public is today demanding so vocally the need to address the way we view sexuality and gender equality is empowering. People are sharing their own experiences of sexual violence on blogs and social media. Men and women are collaborating to seek legal reform, to challenge the societal perceptions they have been force-fed. We now understand that to remain silent bystanders of a crime is to collude with the criminal. It is clear to me that as actors, filmmakers, artists, journalists, activists -- people who use a medium that has the potential to reach so many minds -- it is our responsibility to educate and mobilize, while we entertain. For the last 10 months, as we have been rehearsing and shooting, the subject of rape has been my foremost preoccupation. Two points have struck me in particular: First, the director, who is also the scriptwriter, is male. His co-writer, the music composer, is also male. These two artists, Tarun Chopra and Daboo Malik, chose to champion a cause that almost always gets packaged as a women's issue. In India, sexual violence is perpetrated almost entirely by men. Rapists are male. Should men not feel responsible then to prevent the occurrence of this crime? Shouldn't men be disturbed that their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters constantly feel unsafe or feel they have to dress and behave in a particular way to avoid getting raped? Isn't it time men educated other men about consent? Secondly, and this point took me longer to acknowledge, women are as guilty as men for the mindset that breeds the crime. We kill our own infant daughters, we immolate our sons' wives if they bear female children, we disapprove of women who make an effort to be attractive -- and doubt their character. We still look at marriage as if it's the purpose for which we were born. But misogyny is no longer misogyny when expressed by a woman. It's self-loathing. And while it is easy -- and justified -- for women to point fingers at men for the chauvinism in our society, don't we owe it to ourselves to look within? Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion
A Danish woman has filed a police complaint saying she was gang-raped and robbed near a train station in the Indian capital of New Delhi on Tuesday night, authorities said. The 51-year-old woman said she lost her way while sightseeing in the city. She asked for directions from some men who accosted her and subsequently robbed and raped her, CNN's sister network IBN reported. The woman has since returned to Denmark, police said. Before she left, she refused to undergo a medical checkup required to confirm sexual assault, said Alok Kumar, deputy commissioner of New Delhi police. "She didn't have injuries that required medical attention," he said, declining to provide further details on the woman's complaint. Kumar said they arrested two homeless men, ages 22 and 25, Police recovered an iPod and a phone cable that belonged to the woman. Police also expect a medical report from Danish authorities that will be used as evidence. Three men convicted in gang rape of American tourist in India Denmark's Ambassador to India, Freddy Svane, said Wednesday that a rape complaint had been filed by a Danish citizen, saying that the woman was receiving the support normally provided in such situations. 4 men sentenced to death in New Delhi gang rape case Violent crimes against women have been in the spotlight in India since a 23-year-old woman was raped and beaten by several men on a bus in December 2012. The victim later died in a Singapore hospital. The shocking attack provoked outrage across India, leading to calls for improved safety and treatment of women. Since then, the Indian media have intensified their focus on rape cases. Attacks against foreign women have also been reported. Last year, six men were sentenced to life in prison for the rape and robbery of a Swiss woman in central India. The girl whose rape changed a country The Swiss woman and her husband were on a cycling tour across India in March and had set up camp near a forest. A group of men from a local tribe assaulted them, beating the husband and raping the wife. The couple decided to stay in India to pursue charges against the men. Earlier this month, a Polish woman told police that she was abducted at knife point in in Mathura, south of New Delhi, by a taxi driver who later drugged and raped her, according to IBN. The woman said that when she awoke, she was in the Nizamuddin area of New Delhi.

The 'queen' of Macau's gambling empire is about to unveil a new palace. The foundations are already being laid for Macau's new multi-billion dollar casino-resort, named -- aptly enough -- Wynn Palace. It will be the latest jewel in U.S. business magnate Steve Wynn's glittering casino crown, after he originally built Las Vegas's premier Bellagio, and The Mirage -- now owned by MGM Resorts International. And the person to launch it? Forty-seven year old executive director Linda Chen. Often sighted as a likely successor to billionaire Wynn, Taiwanese-born Chief Operating Officer Chen oversaw the opening of luxury gaming, hotel, and retail complex Wynn Macau, in 2006. And she's not about to stop there. "When we first came to Macau, the scene was more about gaming," Chen told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. "And the aspiration for Macau, the reason we wanted to be here, is taking it to the next level. "In Vegas, it's no longer just about gaming. It's about the entertainment. It's where you would consider the best shows in the world, the best shopping, and the best restaurants. It's about the whole experience, and that's what we wanted to do here." In its first year Wynn Macau quadrupled its annual revenue from $1 billion to $4.5billion, under Chen's stewardship.One of Asia's 50 most powerful businesswomen, according to Forbes, Chen has worked her socks off to become the second in command at Wynn. But could luck also have played a part in her success? Chen apparently has the number 8888 -- considered lucky in Chinese culture -- for her phone, a present from her wealthy boss. Luck or no luck, gaming was not the direction Chen or her parents saw her career going, when she graduated from New York's Cornell University in 1989. "It was the end of the world for them," she says with a laugh. "For Chinese parents coming from Taiwan, they never knew anybody else who worked in the casino industry. They never thought somebody would live outside the casinos in Las Vegas. So it took a while, but eventually they were supportive." Stepping out of her private jet, Chen appears every inch the high-flying business superstar. But when asked about one day succeeding Wynn himself, she is a little reticent. "Mr Wynn's very young, he is not ready to retire soon," Chen says with a smile. "I hope he works for another 30, 40 years -- and I'll be alongside with him."

Some very preliminary talks have been under way "for the past few days" to potentially allow Boston bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to resume providing investigators with information about the attacks in exchange for having the death penalty taken off the table, two government sources say. The sources said such initial communications between opposing sides on a range of procedural and other issues are standard procedure. Communications are in the very early stages, and not a sign lawyers for either side are ready to make a deal, said one source, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions. The source emphasized these are not formal negotiations, and no deals have been offered. The discussions between prosecution and defense attorneys are at a "preliminary, delicate stage" and both refused to offer details of what either side would be willing to leverage, according to the sources. A Justice Department official said it is not accurate to suggest there are negotiations. "The notion that we are engaging in discussions over a penalty is not accurate," the official said. "As far as I know, there are no negotiations." The government has not said whether it will seek the death penalty in this case. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd noted Tuesday that "the federal charges against Tsarnaev authorize a penalty, upon conviction, of death or imprisonment for life, or any term of years." The charges include using a weapon of mass destruction. From fear to cheers: The final hours that paralyzed Boston "We have no comment at this time on what potential penalty the government might seek if the defendant is convicted, particularly given that the defendant has only just been charged," Boyd added. This comes after a federal magistrate judge Monday approved appointment of a defense attorney who specializes in handling capital cases. Judy Clarke of San Diego has a reputation of working with high-profile clients to get death-eligible crimes reduced. She has represented Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Atlanta Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph, and most recently Tucson mass shooter Jared Lee Loughner. Clarke separately cut deals for all three to avoid lethal injection. The suspect is hospitalized with gunshot wounds at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical center in Devens, Massachusetts. He and his brother, Tamerlan, are suspected of detonating two explosive devices at the Boston Marathon race April 15, leaving three dead and more than 175 people wounded. The elder Tsarnaev was killed three days later in a gun battle with police. Legal sources say it is not unusual for both sides to reach out and begin these kinds of conversations in high-profile criminal cases. Those sources say both Tsarnaev's legal team and top-level Justice Department officials also have been meeting separately to weigh their options. Two federal public defenders in Boston -- William Fick and Miriam Conrad -- were in the hospital room April 22 when Tsarnaev had his first court appearance, and had his Miranda rights first read to him by federal Magistrate Marianne Bowler. Those lawyers had asked for Clarke to join the legal team, and they must decide whether their client will cooperate with the ongoing investigation. Tsarnaev's lawyers must weigh the initial evidence the government has presented against their client, and the strength of any additional charges that may be added when a formal indictment is presented in coming weeks. That evidence and Tsarnaev's own private statements about his alleged involvement will shape whether plea negotiations develop over time. On the other side, government sources say investigators are eager to resume questioning of Tsarnaev, for any details about other possible suspects and plots. What may have motivated the brothers to allegedly commit the terror acts is also of major interest to the U.S. intelligence community. Removing execution as a legal option could induce the suspect to talk, but nothing is expected until a grand jury hands down an indictment. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder would have the final say on whether prosecutors would pursue the death penalty at trial. That decision, too, is some weeks off, said another government source. A special team of federal agents were able to speak with the seriously wounded Tsarnaev for about two days without any Miranda warnings being given, under a "public safety exception." CNN has learned the young man admitted to the acts, and said he and his brother acted alone. Sources say he has since stopped talking with the government.

who came from a nearby city -- turned what had been an improving situation into an unnecessarily aggressive encounter that ended in their son's death. "There was no reason to shoot this kid," the teen's stepfather, Mark Wilsey, told WECT on Monday. "They killed my son in cold blood. We called for help, and they killed my son." Although the state Bureau of Investigation is looking into the shooting, the chief prosecutor for the state's 13th Judicial District, which includes Brunswick County, says it's way too early to characterize what happened. "I think that we can certainly understand why this family is upset right now," the Wilmington Star-News newspaper quoted District Attorney Jon David as saying. "They just lost a child, and certainly my thoughts and prayers are with them. But what they want from this office today is justice, and I intend to give them exactly that." CNN first learned of the shooting through an iReport sent by a family friend. The iReport received more than 50,000 views in 24 hours. The incident happened Sunday afternoon when the mother and stepfather of the Boiling Spring Lakes man called police. According to stepbrother Mark Ryan Wilsey, Vidal had schizophrenia and "was having an episode," and his parents wanted police to subdue him so he could get help. "He's not doing very good. You've got to get him someplace," a man who identified himself as Vidal's stepfather said on a 911 call, a copy of which was obtained by WECT. "He wants to fight his mother. ... She's scared to death of him right now." The caller said that Vidal "won't take his medication" and that his family has had "to put him in before, (and) he's getting real bad again." "He's just, he's not right," he said. Two officers arrived and began talking with Vidal, according to CNN affiliate WWAY. The situation was relatively calm until a third officer -- a detective from the nearby city of Southport -- arrived, the family said. "Everything was going good," Mark Wilsey said, according to WWAY. "Then this fat cop from Southport walks in the room, walks around the corner, says, 'We don't have time for this. Tase that kid now. Let's get him out of here.' " The stepfather said Vidal tried to run but was struck with two Taser charges and fell backward. He said the first two officers to respond got on top of Vidal. WECT attributed a slightly different accounting of events to Mark Wilsey. In that retelling, the stepfather said officers had pinned Vidal to the ground after he had been tased and one of the officers said, "We don't have time for this" and shot his stepson. Seventy seconds after the third officer arrived, WECT reported, citing police records, police radioed that they had had to shoot the teenager in self-defense. Mark Ryan Wilsey, who was not at the house but rushed there in an "absolute panic" and claimed that police restrained him, said his family is outraged by what happened and determined to get justice. "We want the truth to be out there," he said. "We don't want the good ole cops system to play out something that ain't the truth." Authorities have not released the exact sequence of events, including how and by whom Vidal was shot. A Southport officer has been placed on paid administrative leave in connection with the shooting, Police Chief Jerry Dove said Tuesday. Authorities have declined to say whether he was the officer who shot Vidal. The Brunswick County sheriff's deputy sent to the scene has been "cleared," office spokeswoman Emily Flax said. A review conducted by its Office of Professional Standards found that the deputy did not violate policy, Flax added. Boiling Spring Lakes Police Chief Brad Shirley said the same thing Tuesday of that department's officer, who was the first to arrive on the scene. The department said in a statement that, after an "internal review," it concluded that the Boiling Spring Lakes police officer who responded did not violate department policy or state law. Neither the district attorney nor the state Bureau of Investigation returned messages seeking comment Tuesday. CNN iReporter Anthony Owens, whom Mark Ryan Wilsey described as a good friend of the family's, described Vidal as a slight young man who was never violent despite his mental illness. "All he wanted to do was play drums," Owens said. "He was so awesome." The late teen's stepbrother said he did everything with Vidal -- hunting, fishing, sports and more -- describing him as a "good kid." "He was my little buddy," Mark Ryan Wilsey said. Owens said the incident highlights the need for more understanding and awareness of mental illness. "I was devastated by the news and am desperate to find some kind of good that could come from this horrible situation," Owens said. Mark Ryan Wilsey offered a similar sentiment, saying his family hopes to start a foundation to help the mentally ill like Vidal. "We're uniting together, and we're going to make this go public," he said of the family's collaboration with Owens. "Because the way my brother got treated ain't right."
Three sex abuse lawsuits against the man who once voiced "Sesame Street's" Elmo character have been dismissed by a federal appeals court. The 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals made its ruling April 2 in the case of puppeteer Kevin Clash, who resigned from his job after allegations first surfaced in November 2012. The ruling agrees with a lower court's decision that the accusers waited too long to file their suits. The appellate court's decision on the three New York lawsuits does not cover a separate lawsuit, filed in Pennsylvania last year, by Clash's first public accuser. No resolution of the Pennsylvania case has been announced. CNN's attempt to contact Clash's attorney for comment Thursday wasn't immediately successful. A district judge had dismissed the New York suits last July, ruling that the statute of limitations -- which requires a filing within six years of the alleged crime or three years after the plaintiffs turned 18 -- had run out. The plaintiffs -- all adult men who said they were courted and seduced by Clash when they were underage teenagers -- appealed, arguing the six-year rule should have applied from 2012. That, they contended, was the year they realized they'd been harmed. The appellate court ruled that the lower court properly dismissed the suits "given that the plaintiffs' complaints failed to provide any reason why the plaintiffs were unable to discover their injuries prior to 2012." Clash provided the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo from 1984 until 2012, when Sheldon Stephens became the first to publicly claim that he had a sexual relationship with Clash as a teen. Stephens called it an "adult consensual relationship" in November 2012, but filed the Pennsylvania lawsuit in March 2013 alleging Clash threw a crystal meth sex party for him in 2004, when he was 16. Stephens' attorney was not immediately available for comment Thursday. Clash acknowledged a relationship between "two consenting adults" when Stephens' story initially emerged, but he said it otherwise was a "false and defamatory allegation." "I am a gay man," Clash, 53, said in a statement in November 2012. "I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter." That month, Clash issued a written statement saying: "I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart. I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately." Sesame Workshop is the nonprofit educational organization behind "Sesame Street."

The giant Buddhas of Bamiyan, once painted in bright colors, remained silent sentinels as they reacquired the hues of the sandstone cliffs from which they were carved. The statues, which looked upon a visually stunning region of central Afghanistan for about 1,500 years, have been gone for 10 years, victims of the Taliban, who destroyed them as part of its campaign to destroy pre-Islamic artifacts considered an assault on the faith. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on Wednesday will begin three days of meetings in Paris about a long-range plan for preserving the snow-capped valley's cultural heritage and the remains of the Buddhas, which overlooked a Buddhist monastery. "They were destroyed in the context of the conflict devastating Afghanistan and to undermine the power of culture as a cohesive force for the Afghan people," said UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova in a statement Monday. A German professor believes reconstructing the smaller figure is possible. UNESCO, which is nearing the completion of an effort to preserve the Buddha niches in Bamiyan and wall paintings, does not favor rebuilding the figures. But it does want to protect the 5,000 fragments of what were once among the world's great artistic and religious treasures. Today, the massive caves where the Buddhas once stood are huge, empty pockets carved into cliffs that dominate the countryside. The recovered pieces -- many the size of large boulders, others as tiny as pebbles -- are stored in several shelters. The smaller female Buddha stood around 10 or 11 stories tall. Professor Erwin Emmerling of the Technical University of Munich, Germany, said reconstruction of the female Buddha is possible, using remaining parts and other materials, according to the university's website. It would not necessarily resemble the ancient statue. The scientist said the work would require a small factory to be built in the Bamiyan Valley. Otherwise, 1,400 rocks, some weighing 2 tons, would have to be sent to Germany. Emmerling will present his findings at the UNESCO conference. The Afghanistan government will have the final decision on any such steps. The statues survived the ravages of Mongolian conqueror and warrior Genghis Khan, centuries of wars and the natural wear and tear of the elements. In March 2001, Taliban militants, using explosives and tank fire, spent weeks blowing up the two colossal figures. One was 55 meters (180 feet) high, the other 38 meters (125 feet). The Technical University analyzed fragments of the statues and determined they were once painted in brilliant shades of blue, pink, orange and red. They had been repainted several times, possibly because of fading, Emmerling said. In 2003, with the support of the governments of France, Britain, Italy and Japan, work was begun on restoring the destroyed artifacts. UNESCO that same year placed the cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley on its World Heritage List and List in Danger. "The site testifies to the region's rich Gandhara school of Buddhist art that, during the 1st to 13th centuries, integrated different cultural influences from East and West," according to UNESCO.

China's maritime authorities issued red alerts on Sunday, representing the highest warning for storm tides and waves as Typhoon Fitow approached land, the country's state news agency, Xinhua, said. Fitow battered the remote southern Japanese island of Okinawa late Saturday, with gusts of up to 120 kilometers per hour (74 miles per hour), Japan's Meteorological agency. Fitow is forecast to make landfall between east China's Fujian and Zhejiang provinces on Monday morning, according to the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center, Xinhua said. Local authorities have been asked to reinforce harbor facilities and repair sea walls to prepare for the tides, according to Xinhua.
Fourth seed David Ferrer was sent crashing out of the U.S. Open by Frenchman Gilles Simon on Sunday, becoming the biggest men's scalp to be taken so far during the final grand slam of the tennis season, while former women's champion Maria Sharapova also exited. In oppressively humid conditions at Flushing Meadows, Simon and Ferrer traded the first two sets 6-3 before Simon found another level to wrap up the final two sets 6-1 6-3. The 26th seed took advantage of some sloppy play by Ferrer, who made 52 unforced errors and appeared to be struggling physically with the heat in the third-round tie. It was a timely victory for Simon, who had lost five of his past six meetings against the Spaniard. "He destroyed me five times before," Simon said after the match. "I just tried to stay loose and relaxed and enjoy myself on court. But I am tired. The weather forecast said it would be cooler today but it didn't feel like it. We ran so much and I am happy to finish in four sets because I knew that against David it would be really hard in the fifth." Simon will play Croatian 14th seed Marin Cilic, who beat South Africa's Kevin Anderson in four sets. "I always have a tough fight with Marin," Simon said after Cilic's victory. Simon has beaten Cilic in his last four encounters but is not taking anything for granted. "Yes, but did you check the scores?! It was always in five sets! We know each other well. It will be a tough fight." Roger Federer continued his bid to become the first man to win six U.S. Open titles as he reached the last 16 with a rain-interrupted win against Spain's Marcel Granollers. The 17-time grand slam champion came from behind to triumph 4-6 6-1 6-1 6-1 against the world No. 42, setting up a fourth-round clash with another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut. The 17th seed equaled his best grand slam performance, matching his achievement of reaching the last 16 at January's Australian Open, as he beat France's Adrian Mannarino in straight sets. "I feel very explosive, quick," second seed Federer said. "The coordination is there, as well. I feel like I've gotten used to the hard courts by now. It's really working well. I'm very pleased." Seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov also came from behind to beat Belgium's David Goffin in four, and the Bulgarian will next play French 20th seed Gael Monfils. Monfils upset 12th-seeded compatriot Richard Gasquet in straight sets to reach the last 16 in New York for the first time since 2009. Czech sixth seed Tomas Berdych also progressed, beating Russia's Teimuraz Gabashvili 6-3 6-2 6-4 to set up a clash with Austrian debutant Dominic Thiem. Thiem, who turns 21 on Wednesday, eliminated Spanish 19th seed Feliciano Lopez 6-4 6-2 6-3 as he continued his best showing at a grand slam, having lost in the first round at Wimbledon and the second at the Australian and French Opens. Meanwhile former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki put a nightmare 2014 firmly behind her by knocking out five-time grand slam winner Sharapova 6-4 2-6 6-2 and book her place in the quarterfinals. French Open champion Sharapova was the strong favorite at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, but the Dane dug deep to win the third set and give her a great chance of winning her first grand slam. "She made me hit a lot of balls," Sharapova told reporters. "That's always been her strength. But she did extremely well today. She's a great retriever, especially in these types of conditions. I just felt like I maybe went for a little too much." Of all the female players left in the draw, only world No. 1 Serena Williams and formerly top-ranked Victoria Azarenka have ever won a grand slam. "It means so much to me," said Wozniacki after her victory over the fifth seed, who won the 2006 U.S. Open and reached the semifinals in her last appearance in 2012. "It's been a bit up and down for me this season ... To win today against a champion like Maria is an unbelievable feeling." Wozniacki, seeded 10th this year, was runner-up in 2009 and made the semis in 2010-11 but has not reached the last four of a grand slam since then. The 24-year-old, who split with golf star Rory McIlroy this year ahead of a planned wedding, will next face Italian 12th seed Sara Errani. Errani, a semifinalist in 2012 after losing in the French Open final earlier that season, ended the dream run of former child prodigy Mirjana Lucic-Baroni as she beat the 32-year-old Croatian 6-3 2-6 6-0. Lucic-Baroni, who came through qualifying and beat world No. 2 Simona Halep in round three, was playing in the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time since 1999 -- when she was a semifinalist at Wimbledon. Belinda Bencic beat former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 to become the youngest U.S. Open quarterfinalist since 1997, when Martina Hingis went on to win the title. The Swiss 17-year-old, who has trained at the academy run by Hingis' mother, will next play China's Peng Shuai -- who likewise progressed to the last eight of the singles competition for the first time in a grand slam. While Bencic is playing in majors for the first time this year, the 28-year-old Peng made her debut a decade ago and has twice won doubles titles, including the French Open in June. Peng ousted 14th-seeded Czech Lucie Safarova 6-3 6-4, having upset world No. 5 Agnieszka Radwanska in round two. "The last couple of times I was in the fourth round I would always lose to good players," said Peng, who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon after first-round exits in Melbourne and Paris. "I knew if I was going to win these matches I needed more courage on the court."
China's new paramount leader, Xi Jinping, is making the fight against corruption his No. 1 mission. In several speeches since he took over the reins of the Communist Party last November, he has warned that corruption could lead to "the collapse of the Party and the downfall of the state." Xi sees corruption as a threat to the party's legitimacy. He exhorted fellow leaders to learn from the experience of other countries where "corruption has played a big role in conflicts that grew over lengthy periods, and ... led to popular discontent, social unrest and the overthrow of the political power." He did not mention names, but clearly he was referring to Libya, Egypt and other authoritarian and corrupt regimes that have been overthrown in the wake of the Arab Spring revolutions. Xi urged officials to "build a clean government, show self-discipline and restrain their relatives and associates." Chosen to lead the cleanup is Wang Qishan, 64, who until recently was China's economic-finance czar and now is chief of the Party's anti-corruption body. Wang, also known as a "firefighter," is a no-nonsense, blunt-talking administrator and has been a go-to trouble shooter. In the 1990s, he was sent to Guangdong to clean up the "debt crisis" in the southern province. Years later, he was dispatched to Hainan province to curb rampant smuggling and corruption. In 2003, he was called to Beijing to replace the city mayor accused of covering up the SARS crisis, the massive pandemic that spread across China and beyond. Wang's political skills will be put to test in his new job. Corruption has long been a major public complaint, and there is certainly no shortage of cases. In the past five years, China has punished 668,400 people for "Party discipline violations" and more than 24,600 suspects have been referred for investigation, according to China Daily. There are various ways to acquire ill-gotten wealth and just as many to hide them. Some spirit millions of cash out of the country. Others stash them in luxury villas, expensive jewelries and accessories -- or business ventures by relatives and associates. Still others blow their loot enjoying sybaritic lifestyles, lavishing wealth on mistresses or simply gambling it away in casinos. Disgraced politicians include: - A lowly bureaucrat who despite a modest salary has been found to be wearing expensive-looking watches on various occasions. Internet watchdogs have dubbed him "Brother Watch." - A senior official now known as "Uncle House" who was found by government officials to own 21 houses despite being on a meager income. - A district Communist Party chief in Chongqing, who was fired after being caught on video having sex with a young woman who was alleged to be a prostitute. - The former chief of China Railway Container Transport, who was sacked and accused of receiving bribes of 47 million yuan ($7.5 million) between 2005 and 2010. - The Sichuan provincial deputy secretary who was removed for alleged "serious discipline violations," the most senior official to have fallen since the new leaders took over in November. To be sure, China has been making efforts to crack down on graft. From May 2011, the amended Criminal Law criminalizes bribery of foreign government officials and officials of international public organizations. It also regulates the use of gift cards to curb money laundering, illegal cash withdrawals, tax evasion and bribery. The current solution largely focuses on punishment instead of prevention -- "Kill the chicken to scare the monkey," as the Chinese put it. Execute one and deter 100. Prevention, experts say, is better than investigation and punishment. In a recent meeting, Wang said "trust can never replace supervision." He is now calling for "institutional prevention and punishment of corruption." Wang recently summoned eight experts to solicit ideas. Most advocated a system of requiring party officials to disclose their assets. In fact, the notion of public disclosure of official's assets was proposed some 18 years ago. Wang Quanjie (no relation to Politburo member Wang Qishan), then a delegate to the National People's Congress, China's legislature, submitted three bills proposing the idea in 1994, "Public disclosure of property in China is really difficult, and it's especially difficult to make it a system. Our goal is to establish a system, not just punish some people," he said in December . He Jiahong, a professor at Renmin University and an expert on corruption, proposes a form of amnesty that will give officials until the end of 2013 to declare their assets publicly. Those who do so will be exempted from punishment for any acts of corruption. Hong Kong's government adopted a similar move in 1977 to root out mafia-related corruption in what was then a colonial state. Wang supports the idea but agrees that persuading officials to come clean will be next to impossible. In fact, about one million officials of certain rank are already required to report their assets -- but only internally. "After the declarations are made, they are kept in a black box, and they become scrap of paper," He of Renmin University complained. Wang, the delegate, says the key is making asset declarations accessible to the public. "If the common people cannot find out their assets, if nobody except themselves knows the truth, it cannot solve the problem." "It's like asking the left hand to supervise the right hand, or asking the mother to supervise her son," he added. "It's impossible for the mother to send the son to the police when he commits the crime." Eighteen years after Wang first proposed his "sunshine policy," it still remains on the drawing board. Small wonder many Chinese doubt the government's sincerity in fighting corruption. Bloggers point out that, by contrast, the legislature took only a few days to deliberate and pass a new law that requires Internet users to register under their real names. The new law is meant to crack down on Internet scams and junk mail and "protect the public from baseless and libelous accusations." But critics say it will merely blunt the power of the microblogging site Weibo, which whistleblowers use to expose cases under pseudonyms without fear of retribution or punishment. In the absence of the "sunshine law," muckraking Chinese turn to the Internet to expose official abuse. Despite heavy government restrictions and self-censorship, internet activists have cleverly used Weibo to spot and expose corrupt officials. China now has over 400 million Weibo users, and microblogs have become "an inescapable snare for corrupt officials," according to the official Xinhua News Agency. "The miraculous microblogs have become the nightmare of the corrupted."
of mostly media and friends, or their "chosen family," as many of their kin don't approve of their relationship -- they awoke at 5 a.m. Monday to get dressed "so that when we got out of the tent we'd look like a million bucks," Sisson said. Sisson, 24, and Wolfe, 21, have known each other for seven years. They've been dating for two. Last year, the pair got "spiritually married" in Tuskegee, but it wasn't a state-recognized union -- where all the rights and benefits of matrimony are conferred on both partners. They previously considered going to a state that allowed same-sex marriage, but Wolfe balked at the idea. "We work here and we pay taxes here, and we didn't feel it was right that we'd have to do that because nobody else does," she said. Though there were some minor computer problems in issuing their license, their wish soon came true. With one of their godmothers performing the ceremony, they exchanged vows outside the courthouse and kissed as a phalanx of media cameras captured the moment. (One of those cameras belonged to the Human Rights Campaign, a watchdog group involved in marriage equality advocacy; Sisson works for the organization.) Sisson wept, while Wolfe did not. "One of us has to hold it together," Wolfe quipped. Sisson's tears weren't borne solely of the bliss that comes with being joined in union with your beloved. Sure, those sentiments were there, Sisson said, but she cried also because she had been thinking all night about the myriad couples who were denied the opportunity she and Wolfe were able to seize Monday. "We have the honor to be the first couple in Montgomery County to do this. It's amazing," Sisson said, explaining the "overwhelming and overflowing love I have for Shanté but also for people and the hope I have in my heart that this really means progress here." Though the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama cleared the way for same-sex marriages to begin Monday in Alabama, the famously conservative chief justice of the state Supreme Court on Sunday mounted a last-ditch effort to stop the weddings, instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. That didn't stop several couples from converging on county courthouses across the state. Probate Judge Alan King in Jefferson County, the state's most populous, said there appeared to be a larger-than-usual crowd outside the courthouse when he arrived at work Monday. State Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was ousted from his first chief justice post in 2003 after refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery, wrote that his Sunday order on same-sex marriages is necessary to ensure justice in the state. "Effective immediately, no Probate Judge of the State of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama Probate Judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent" with the state code or constitution, Moore wrote in the order. The state code says "marriage is inherently a unique relationship between a man and a woman." The American Civil Liberties Union called Moore's order spurious and reminded Alabama's probate judges they are sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution, which outweighs state law on this issue. "Judge Roy Moore has no authority to trump a federal court's decision," said Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. "By issuing his 'order,' he has done nothing but create confusion among the different probate offices across the state. Whereas some counties are issuing licenses to same-sex couples, there are many who aren't. Unfortunately, we have received a number of complaints to that effect." The Human Rights Campaign has already denounced the order as a "clear violation of all codes of legal ethics," and several counties -- including Jefferson, Montgomery and Madison -- have told CNN they intend to issue same-sex marriage licenses Monday. But in Tuscaloosa County, where five same-sex couple were awaiting licenses when the court opened Monday, chief probate clerk Lisa Whitehead said the court would follow Moore's guidance. "We will be issuing traditional marriage licenses," she told CNN. Shelby, Marshall and Houston counties also are declining to issue the licenses, and in Lee County, where two same-sex couples attempted to tie the knot Monday, Judge Bill English said he, too, was "complying with an order from the chief justice late last night." Other probate judges weren't sure Moore had the law behind him. "I was shocked," King said of his reaction to Moore's order. "I'm old enough to remember the George Wallace stand in the schoolhouse door. I was a kid at the time." King was referencing the 1963 attempt by then-Gov. Wallace to stop the federally ordered desegregation of schools by blocking black students from entering the University of Alabama's Foster Auditorium. Contacted before his court opened for the day, King said he doesn't want to be on that side of history. After consulting with attorneys who helped him analyze Moore's order, "I'm convinced it's my duty to follow the U.S. Constitution and the federal court order. At 8 a.m., we will be issuing marriage licenses to all in Jefferson County. ... I don't think (Moore's order) is grounded in legal theory, just like Gov. Wallace in the 1960s was not grounded in law," he said. Gov. Robert Bentley said he would not punish probate judges who issue the licenses. In a statement that included a link to the U.S. Supreme Court's dissenting opinion but not the majority opinion that cleared the way for the marriages, the governor said he was disappointed "a single Federal court judge disregarded the vote of the Alabama people to define marriage as between a man and woman." He added that he had "great respect" for the legal process and said, "We will follow the rule of law in Alabama, and allow the issue of same sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channels." Anyone monitoring the situation in Alabama likely expected Moore to try and block it. Four days after a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriages on January 23, Moore hand-delivered a letter to Bentley calling for him "to stop judicial tyranny and any unlawful opinions issued without constitutional authority." The federal court that struck down the ban permitted a stay until Monday to allow probate courts to prepare. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the marriages until the high court rules on a case on its docket that will decide the fate of same-sex marriages in four states. The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday it would not intervene for now, making Alabama the 37th state (plus Washington, D.C.) to permit same-sex marriages. "In this case, the Court refuses even to grant a temporary stay when it will resolve the issue at hand in several months," Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent. "I would have shown the people of Alabama the respect they deserve and preserved the status quo while the Court resolves this important Constitutional question." Strange responded in a statement: "In the absence of a stay, there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the Supreme Court's anticipated ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage." Strange further advised probate judges to consult with their attorneys "about how to respond to the ruling." Opinion: Gay marriage is Alabama judge's latest battle CNN's Devon M.

and crowds of screaming women bearing dollar bills. The "MMXXL" trailer opens with a masked Magic Mike, played by Channing Tatum, welding metal in a suggestive manner and then breaking into a smooth dance routine to Ginuwine's "Pony." The trailer premiered on "The Ellen Show." Its tag line: "Get back to the grind." The steamy marketing campaign rides on Tatum's toned shoulders, but most of the original cast (except now-Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey) is back to bump and grind for the reboot. Viewers can expect more partying, fast cars and sexual entanglements as seen in the first installment. On Tuesday, Tatum tweeted a stripped-down movie poster that announces the release date: Coming July 1. "Magic Mike XXL" is counting on the extra sexy trailer and film poster to build on the success of the first movie, which grossed $167,221,571 worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. If reactions are any indication, fans don't even want to wait for summer to witness the hotness.
Pakistan is blocking access to Facebook in response to an online group calling on people to draw the Prophet Mohammed, officials said Wednesday. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority issued the order a day before "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day," scheduled by a Facebook group with the same name. "Obviously (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked," said Khoram Ali Mehran of the telecommunication authority. "We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it, then that's what we will do," he said. The organization has not received any complaints from internet users about the blocking of Facebook, he said. Devout Muslims consider it offensive to depict Mohammed. There were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2005, and at least two European cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the Muslim prophet. Mimi Sulpovar, who started the Facebook group, said she read about the idea on a blog after Comedy Central bleeped out part of an episode of "South Park" that mentioned the prophet. "This is meant to be in protest," she said. "This is something I have felt strongly about for a long time: Bullying by certain Muslim groups will not be tolerated in a free country," said Sulpovar, who is American. But Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the idea behind the group was offensive. "Islam discourages any visual representations of the prophets of God -- Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship," he said. "The majority of Muslims worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of God," he said. The idea of "Draw Mohammad Day" originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea, Sulpovar and Hooper said. "The whole campaign has been taken up by Muslim-bashers and Islamophobes," Hooper said. But Sulpovar denied being anti-Muslim. "This extends beyond being able to draw Mohammad," she said. "If it's offensive to you, that's fine, but I don't feel it's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation. "This is nothing to do with hate or bigotry," she said. "Nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals." Sulpovar said she is not a Muslim but added that she had received "hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me." One group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised. "This is a hot-topic debate, but so is abortion, illegal immigrants, gay marriage and politics. If we allow even a small compromise for one group, then the free speech on topics like abortion, illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate," Autumn Meadows said on CNN's iReport. "Hate speech is wanting a group eradicated, physically harmed or dead. I dont think drawing Mohammed falls under that category," she said. "Islam is not above criticism or cartoons. I believe in equality, and censoring Mohammed while we can draw every other figure in the world does not equal equality," she concluded. Sulpovar said Pakistan's decision to block Facebook was "ridiculous." Facebook is investigating the block, said Debbie Frost, the company's director of global communications. Sulpovar's group and a similar one had attracted about 7,000 fans between them Wednesday. Groups opposing the idea had about 68,000. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.
A lengthy separation -- and a surprise trip to Paris -- caused this husband and wife to realize that their marriage could be saved. Mary L. Tabor and Del Persinger Washington, D.C. Married 26 years Mary was still in her nightgown and robe, sipping a cappuccino in the kitchen of the Washington, D.C., brownstone she shared with her husband, Del, when he walked in and announced he wanted to live alone. They had been married for 21 years. "I didn't know what had hit me," Mary, 64, recalls of that fall morning in 2005. "I wondered, does he have a girlfriend? A boyfriend? I had no idea what was wrong." Although the couple's relationship had been strained for a few months, Mary simply assumed they were going through a rough patch. She attributed Del's loss of interest in sex and his suddenly quick temper to stress from his high-pressure job as a financial analyst. "Del was so on edge that he would yell at me about every little thing -- like a knife accidentally placed in the dishwasher with the point up," says Mary, a writer and a teacher. Still, she figured that things would soon return to normal. RealSimple.com: How to break bad habits For Del, the decision had been a long time coming. Increasingly restless within his marriage, he wondered whether it was holding him back from leading a more exciting life. "I knew the problem wasn't Mary -- it was me," he says. "And I felt I needed to work through my mixed emotions alone." To Mary's frustration, Del couldn't articulate any of these concerns -- all she knew was that he wanted a separation. She and Del took turns sleeping in the guest room for a few months until she moved into an apartment of her own. By January 2006, the couple had hired attorneys. Their home, which they had spent the previous seven years painstakingly renovating, was put up for sale. Mary felt "broken" without Del, who had helped her raise two children from her first marriage and supported her through the deaths of her parents and sister. "He understood me better than anyone," she says. She tried to move on and began dating other men -- to little avail. "I was still in love with my husband." For Del, the bachelor lifestyle lost its luster rather quickly. "I thought the separation would allow me to make all those friends I never had, do all the things I never did," says Del, 61. But in reality his days were fairly mundane. "I went to work, went to the gym, and spent the rest of my time reading." He also found himself stalling on the divorce negotiations, bringing up smaller and smaller details. In retrospect, he realizes he probably did that to prolong the process indefinitely. By August 2009, the couple had cautiously started spending time together again, even venturing out on a few dates. "It wasn't the dinners or dances that made me feel in love, but the conversations," says Mary. Del, who had been seeing a therapist, finally opened up to her about his worries and fears. "To me, the most seductive thing a man can do is be truly honest," says Mary. Del had clearly experienced a change of heart. But Mary, concerned it wouldn't last, wanted time to think. In the winter of 2009, she took an extended trip alone to Paris. One morning, as she was having her breakfast, her cell phone rang. It was Del. He had flown in from D.C. and was outside her building. Could he come up? Mary buzzed him in, and when he reached her doorway, suitcase in hand, he told her how much he loved her. That grand romantic gesture, so out of character for Del, "moved me deeply," says Mary. "At that moment, I thought our marriage could be saved." RealSimple.com: Things worth admitting to A few weeks later, the pair flew home together. Del sold his apartment and moved in with Mary. Divorce proceedings were halted. Their "new" relationship is free of the stressful arguments that were so commonplace back in 2005, the couple report. "I'm not confused anymore, so I'm a more contented person," says Del. "Del is at ease with himself, and that makes him at ease in the world," Mary explains. "When people hear that Del left me, they say, 'You were betrayed!' But I don't feel that way. Look, life is messy. I'm happy we got this second shot." Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2010 Time Inc. All rights reserved.
A few weeks ago, my 11-year-old daughter was cut from her travel soccer team. Two years ago this month, my son wasn't accepted into the sixth-grade honors math. Was I disappointed? Absolutely. Bitter? Definitely. But after initially reeling from both of these losses, I learned to embrace the failure. Parents are hardwired to want their kids to succeed. It's probably biologically rooted in our ultimate survival. In an earlier evolutionary period, failure was fatal. Today, failure is not making a competitive sports team, a select program or the college of your choice. We are the generation of drone parents hovering above and swaddling our kids in bubble wrap so they don't get hurt when they fall. In fact, we do everything possible to not let them fall. In an uber-competitive age where we exhaust ourselves in the pursuit of perfection for our children, even from the womb, parents have bought into the myth of how to turn out successful people. We are living in a world of tutors, private lessons and specialized coaching, thoroughly believing that with all the right scaffolding, we can guarantee our kids WILL soar. Ironically, at a time when our parenting culture is all about ensuring success, the innovative business culture of Silicon Valley celebrates failure. New York Magazine recently had a cover story called "The Failure Fetish of Silicon Valley." There are books, blogs and even conferences devoted to embracing the flop. There's no stigma or shame. In fact, a failed venture is a notch in the belt, an honor of distinction, a bragging right. The founder of a start-up that goes belly up may even be courted to take the helm of another company. They turn failure into a rite of passage among the best and the brightest. Reinvent and move on -- that's the ethos of enterprising entrepreneurs today and perhaps that is a great lesson for parents, too. As the economy has shifted from an industrial to information one, experimentation is key. The ability to pivot, shift and keep trying is critical. Failure is an inevitable part of that process. "Agility is the new smart," says Annmarie Neal, founder of the Center for Leadership Innovation. Neal is a trained psychologist, former chief talent officer at Cisco and author of "Leading from the Edge: Global Executives Share Strategies for Success." She is also a mother of an 11-year-old son. Neal says that in today's economy, the secret sauce for kids' future success is to raise children in an environment where they are encouraged to test boundaries, engage with the world, and yes, even fail. "If you haven't failed, then you haven't significantly learned anything to be able to move to the next stage," Neal said. "When kids don't learn how to fail, it creates a neurotic energy around perfectionism. They get stuck in a loop around perfect and they lose that opportunity to learn from the experience." Failing spectacularly is probably not what we are hoping for when it comes to our vision for our children. Personally, it's painful to flop and watching our own kids struggle can be heartbreaking. Two years ago, when I got the letter that my son didn't make it into the honors math class in sixth grade, not only was he crushed -- I, too, spent the summer miserable that he would not be in the coveted math class. But my son worked hard that year and was promoted to honors math in seventh grade. Recently, my son's honors math teacher told me that the kids who try the hardest in her class are those who weren't in the sixth-grade class. The kids who got bumped up into honors just continue to work harder. This is when I realized that failing fast could ultimately pay off, not only in an entrepreneurial environment, but for our children, too. We don't want our kids to be paralyzed by the fear of failure. To succeed in a world where innovation and creativity is the new currency, we want our kids to have the courage to try to push limits and take risks. "The world is so flat and the competitive landscape has changed," says David Roth, CEO and founder of the technology company AppFirst. He is also the father of two girls, one of whom just found out that she was cut from her high school travel softball team. "Kids need to learn lessons on how to work through this stuff and not become stressed out or paralyzed. We don't want them giving up their dreams. We also need to create some toughness and mental skills around having to navigate disappointment so failure is not crushing." When Roth hires employees, one of the things he looks for are people who can own their mistakes and not hide them. He's found that among Millennials he's hiring now, the ones afraid to fail or admit failure are the ones who don't survive at his company. "The more disruptive, innovative and game changing of an environment that you are trying to create, the more you need personalities that can try to work through it and deal with falling down," Roth says. This is the culture of the changing economy. When our travel soccer league merged two teams into one a few weeks ago, nearly one-third of the girls were cut. At first, none of the parents wanted to tell their daughters the devastating news. We were scrambling to see if we could create a second team by pulling players from other places, all to avoid the disappointing truth that our daughters were no longer on the team. Within a couple of days, I decided to take our girls and join a local recreational soccer team that was competitive and had some great parent coaches. Pick up and move on -- that's what I advised my fellow parents. I also thought this was a teachable moment for my own daughter. "Resiliency and flexibility and the ability to adapt to the world is more important than ever," Neal said. Failure has never felt so good. How have you helped your kids through failure?

Harvard University moved Thursday to allow ROTC programs to set up on campus, after years of restricting the U.S. military's access because of its "don't ask, don't tell" policy. The Cambridge, Massachusetts, school barred Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs from being based on its campus 40 years ago, at the height of the Vietnam War. For more than a decade, university leaders -- among them, former law school dean and current U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan -- have cited the military's policy prohibiting gays and lesbians from serving openly as the chief rationale for continuing the ban. Harvard President Drew Faust cited the recent decision to overturn that policy as the genesis for the university's new tact. She will sign an agreement Friday with Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to re-establish a home for ROTC on campus, the school announced in a press release. "Our renewed relationship affirms the vital role that the members of our armed forces play in serving the nation and securing our freedoms, while also affirming inclusion and opportunity as powerful American ideals," Faust said in the statement. The full, formal recognition will take effect once repeal of the so-called "don't ask, don't tell" law, which had made it against military policy for homosexuals to serve openly, is complete this summer, according to the release. Harvard will appoint a director for the Navy ROTC program and take over direct financial responsibility for the cost of students to participate in the program. Congress voted to repeal the policy in December, setting off a three-part process. Last month, for instance, all four branches of the U.S. military began training required as part of the repeal. The university is setting up a committee, to be chaired by professor Kevin "Kit" Parker, a U.S. Army Reserve captain who served three tours in Afghanistan, to look into a host of issues, including bringing other military branches back onto campus. Harvard was one of the first six educational institutions, in 1926, to host Naval ROTC programs, the Navy noted in a release. Once the change goes into effect, active-duty Navy and Marines personnel will meet on campus with students participating in the ROTC program. "(Navy) ROTC's return to Harvard is good for the university, good for the military, and good for the country," said Mabus, in a statement from the Navy. "With exposure comes understanding, and through understanding comes strength." Harvard's own policy regarding ROTC on campus was the subject of national attention eight months ago, when Kagan -- who was then a nominee for the high court -- came under criticism by Republican senators who complained that she actively tried to block military recruiters from Harvard Law School when she was dean. Kagan and the White House strongly defended her actions, saying that while she opposed the military's policy, Kagan never kept recruiters off the university. Four months after taking the job as Harvard's dean, in October 2003, Kagan sent a campus-wide email to students saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus "causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy." She called the "don't ask, don't tell" policy "a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order." CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.
In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, Russia criticized France's decision to airlift weapons to rebel forces in Libya, according to a Western diplomat present during the discussions. Earlier Tuesday, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told reporters that parachute drops of weapons into the North African nation were "no longer necessary" because opposition forces had become organized enough to procure their own arms. Rebels battling Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are "becoming more autonomous," Longuet said. "This autonomy allows them to build relationships with external partners, including when it comes to equipping themselves in self-defense," he said. But even as Longuet said the weapons drops were no longer needed, debate over the approach continued. Russia brought up the issue at the U.N. Security Council session Tuesday, arguing that by sending weapons, France had violated the council's resolution that authorized NATO force in Libya, the Western diplomat said. France offered a detailed defense of the country's actions, arguing that supplying weapons was "the only practical way of fulfilling" the council's mandate authorizing force to take "all necessary measures" to protect civilians, the diplomat said. During Tuesday's meeting, ambassadors from the United Kingdom and United States defended France's actions, according to the Western diplomat. France acknowledged last Wednesday that it had supplied weapons to anti-Gadhafi forces, saying the weapons were provided for self-defense. "It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi's forces," French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard said last Wednesday. Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi told reporters last week that rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use. He said it was reckless of France to take such action, saying it went "against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO's intervention in Libya." Meanwhile, in Libya, a rebel spokesman said fighting had moved Tuesday westward from Misrata, which rebel forces say they continue to hold. Eleven rebels were killed in Dafniya, and one was killed in Zliten, said Mohammed Ibrahim, the spokesman. Another 60 rebels were wounded in the two cities, he said, citing figures from Al-Hekma Hospital, in Misrata. Pro-Gadhafi forces fired some six rockets into Misrata, but they caused no casualties, he said. The opposition website freemisurata.com, published by Ibrahim's group, said at least 20 members of Gadhafi's forces were killed and six were captured Tuesday in Dafniya and Zliten.

Minuscule levels of radiation from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant incident have been detected in a widening number of U.S. states, but the Environmental Protection Agency reaffirmed this week that the levels represent no threat to public health. "To date, data from EPA's real-time radiation air monitoring networks continue to show typical fluctuations in background radiation levels," Jonathan Edwards, director of the EPA's Radiation Protection Division, said in a statement Monday. "The levels we are seeing are far below any levels of concern." At least 15 states reported detecting radioisotopes in air or water or both. No states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide, a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine. Progress Energy reported over the weekend that iodine-131 was detected in the air near its nuclear power plants near Hartsville, South Carolina, and Crystal River, Florida. "We know that it's not coming from our plant," said Progress spokesman Drew Elliot. Had the U.S. nuclear plants been responsible for the radioactive iodine, other isotopes would also have been found, he said. The levels detected were so low that authorities do not require they be reported, he said. Sensors in Maryland have also reported elevated levels of I-131 in air samples. "None of these levels pose a risk to health," the state's Department of Health said. The Maryland secretary of health said Monday that microscopic amounts were also discovered Friday in rainwater. He said the levels found posed no risk to public health. The Massachusetts Department of Health said Sunday that a monitoring station in Boston detected I-131 in rainwater on March 22, but had not detected any in air. In a question-and-answer page on its website, it says the amount detected should not concern residents. On Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said rainwater collected Friday from his state's nuclear power plant facilities contained low levels of iodine-131 "likely originating from the events at Japan's damaged nuclear plants. But weekend tests of drinking water found no elevated levels of radioactivity." The levels reported "are still about 25 times below the level that would be of concern," Corbett's office said in a statement. Similar testing in other states, including California and Washington, has shown comparable levels of iodine-131 in rainwater samples. Trace detections were found in the air in Oregon, Colorado and California. Duke Energy spokeswoman Rita Sipe said Duke Energy had detected trace radioactive elements, likely to have originated from Japan's Fukushima plant, in North Carolina and South Carolina -- but at a level "far below" reporting requirements. EPA is using the nationwide radiation monitoring system, RadNet, to monitor the nation's air and drinking water, milk and precipitation. An analysis from 12 monitors nationwide found "slightly higher" levels of radioactive isotopes in Alaska, Alabama, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Saipan, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state over the past week, the agency said. "Some of the filter results show levels slightly higher than those found by EPA monitors last week and a Department of Energy monitor the week before," the agency said. "These types of findings are to be expected in the coming days and are still far below levels of public health concern." A spokeswoman for the EPA said Monday that 90 percent of the 124 RadNet monitors were working.
Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared martial law beginning Friday night in the southern province of Maguindanao, where 57 people were killed last week, an army spokesman told CNN Saturday. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized. "Life is to resume normally and martial law is established to prevent new violence, with troops on the ground monitoring any possible violence breakout," he said. "But the civilian government will be running the affairs of the province, not a military governor." Military police have detained three brothers and their father on suspicion of involvement in the unrest: Akmad Ampatuan, the vice governor of Maguindanao; Anwar Ampatuan, the mayor of Sherif Auguak, Maguindanao's capital; and Zaldy Ampatuan, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he too was taken in. "Local government will function, it will prevent armed groups from wreaking havoc ... and it will allow the officials to search and find the guilty parties," Brawner said. Security forces on Friday searched the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay and son of the provincial governor of Maguindanao, according to Brawner. Authorities say Andal Ampatuan Jr. directed the November 23 politically motivated killings. Weapons were found in the house, Brawner said. On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday. "At the moment, we are interviewing the witness, so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao," NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre. "He is very vital," Mantaring said. "From what I know ... he knows a lot of information regarding the incident." Among the victims in the massacre were the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael "Toto" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election. Also killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims. CNN's Talia Kayali contributed to this report.
Last year, at Wellesley High School in Massachusetts, David McCullough Jr., an English teacher at the school and the son of the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough, gave the commencement address. He knocked it out of the park, and his words traveled far. What he had to say, America was desperate to hear. McCullough believes that much of today's youth is "pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, bubble-wrapped" and shielded from reality. He told the graduates: "Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you." I've had the privilege of delivering a commencement address, at a university in central California, and I hope someday to deliver another. In fact, I already know what I want to say. So let me try it out on the class of 2013. Talk to college professors or human resource managers or employers. Read the research done on the so-called Millennial generation, and you'll find lots of evidence that McCullough was on the right track. The young people of today have often spent their lives being coddled, catered to and spared the stress of living up to expectations. People usually tell them only what they want to hear. Obama to new grads: "No time for excuses" Not me. I'd rather tell our future leaders what they need to hear. Here are 10 provocative pieces of advice that this year's class of college and university graduates would be wise to take to heart: 1) Have your parents introduce themselves to you. Interview them, and record it. Ask them about their lives, and what stories or lessons they'd like to share with their grandchildren. They gave you life, so the least you can do is try to understand theirs. When they're gone, you'll be glad you did. 2) Follow your passion but be open to the idea that your passion might change and evolve over the years as you do. Don't be afraid to change course and go in a different direction. You're allowed to have second thoughts, about what you want to do and how you intend to spend your life. 3) Never forget that, despite what society has told you, you're not special, as McCullough said in his graduation speech. The world doesn't revolve around you. And you mustn't feel entitled to anything. No one is better than you, but you're not better than anyone else. Treat everyone with respect, as long as they treat you the same way. 4) Break out of your comfort zone. Do what you're most afraid of. Avoid what is easy and predictable. Travel the country and the world. Meet new people and strive to see the world from their vantage point. Stay curious. Ask questions. And never stop learning. 5) Don't just accept failure, but welcome it. Expect it. Learn from it. Treat it as a valuable learning experience. Remember, if you always get everything you want, and accomplish everything you set out to do, then you've failed anyway. Because you've set your goals too low. 6) Question authority and challenge your beliefs. Jump into the public debate. Become engaged. Democracy is a participatory sport; you take part, or you get taken apart. It doesn't matter what you believe. What matters is that you thought your way there and can explain why you believe it. 7) For those of you who choose, or are able, to get married -- and hopefully, one day, all of you will be -- who you decide to marry will go a long way toward determining your success. It's more important than degrees from fancy schools. People can either lift you up, or bring you down. Choose well. 8) For those who you who choose, or are able, to have children, when you set to raise them, give them the one thing they want most: your time. Teach them to be productive. But more importantly, teach them, by example, to be good people, who treat fellow human beings kindly and with respect. 9) As you go through life, don't be afraid to have high expectations of your children, of others, and of yourself. There are worse things than being disappointed because someone didn't perform as you hoped. Like giving up on them and not expecting much from the beginning. 10) Finally, many years from now, when you go to your rest, your most important accomplishment in life won't be the money you earned or the success you enjoyed. The only thing that will endure, and let the world know you were here in the first place, is the impact you had on other people. Make it a positive one. That's it. Take it, or leave it. Everyone enjoys the comfort of a warm bath. But sometimes, what's called for is a cold shower. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.
In death, as in life, the two brothers were inseparable. Connor Barthe, 6, the loud protective big brother with a wicked smile and deep dimples. Noah, the little albeit quieter one, who wanted to play basketball when he grew up. Their Canadian community of Campbellton, New Brunswick, eulogized the boys Saturday, days after they were strangled to death by an African rock python. The 100-pound snake came crashing through the ceiling of a family friend's apartment, where they were having a sleepover Monday. "How can we prepare for such a service? There's not really any way to prepare," Father Maurice Frenette, the interim pastor at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, told CBC News. At the altar, the brothers smiled broadly in a picture, leaning against each other. Family members described them as sharing a close bond. They were best friends and shared everything, including their love of video games. Police: Boys killed by snake died from asphyxiation "Boys, oh boys, we loved those boys," family friend Melissa Ellis said, according to CBC News. The two were visiting the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, who owns a pet store, when the tragic incident happened. The python was kept in a glass enclosure similar to an aquarium, but slithered into the ventilation system. It was above the living room, where the boys were sleeping, when the ceiling caved in. Savoie's son was asleep in another room, but was not harmed, CBC News reported. The city's deputy mayor expressed his condolences and asked the community not to rush to judgment. African rock pythons are not allowed in the province , the Department of Natural Resources told CBC News "Mr. Savoie, he is a human being and you know, he is suffering, he is grieving, so everyone is grieving as well for Mr. Savoie," Ian Comeau said. As questions surround the incident, the family says the are forever changed. "Were they taken from us too soon? Absolutely. But how much time would have been enough?" said Nadine Poirier, who delivered the eulogy. The funeral service concluded with a somber rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" as the procession walked out. And as a symbol of their brotherly bond, they were laid to rest in a single, pale blue casket.
Libya is expelling Syria's diplomats because of the escalation of the government's crackdown on its people, Libya's Foreign Ministry announced Thursday. The Syrian charge d'affaires was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Tripoli on Wednesday and told to leave with his staff within 72 hours, ministry spokesman Saad Elshlmani said. "The reason for this is the position of the Syrian regime towards the Syrian people," he explained. "After this escalation and the Arab League meetings in Cairo and the draft resolution ... Libya found it's the time to take a much stronger position against the Syrian regime." The Syrian state news agency SANA reported the Syrian consul in Libya, Mohammed al-Ghazawi, and his staff were attacked by gangs on their way to the Foreign Ministry, where they were told to leave. The gangs attacked the Syrians' cars with clubs, knives, and cleavers, SANA reported. The Syrian Embassy was also attacked and looted, the news agency said. A number of other nations have expelled Syria's ambassadors over the violence. They include Tunisia and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. Other countries, including the United States, have either closed their own embassies in Syria or temporarily recalled their ambassadors from Damascus. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report.
On Earth Day on Wednesday, Dr. David Jentsch marched at the head of a column of UCLA students and faculty members to the chant of, "Stand up for science!" Across the street a smaller but equally vocal group of animal rights advocates chanted, "U-C-L-A, how many animals have you killed today!" Animal rights activists say large numbers of animals are killed each year during medical trials. Until recently, Jentsch had never dreamed he would lead a political demonstration. But Jentsch's life took a sharp turn last month when his car was firebombed in his driveway. A radical group of animal rights activists claimed responsibility for the act. "This is terror," Jentsch said. "There is no two ways about it. It's extremism. It's an attempt to intimidate." It was the latest in a string of arson attacks against UCLA researchers who use animals in medical research projects. Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars. No arrests have been made in the cases, which are being investigated by an FBI lead task force on terrorism. "We believe it's just a matter of time before someone is going to be hurt," said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Salvador Hernandez. "The intent of these groups is to intimidate and coerce." Hernandez heads up the task force investigating the series of attacks and says their actions qualify as terrorist attacks. But animal rights advocate Chris DeRose says nothing could be further from the truth "There has never been one human being in this country being killed or even hurt," he said. He believes the university researchers are the bad guys. "What I do condemn is what goes on behind those walls," he says. DeRose, founder of Last Chance for Animals, says he doesn't condone firebombing researchers' homes, but he doesn't condemn it either.  Watch people against animal research at protest » "The reason these people are doing it is because they have been pushed ... nobody is listening ... over a hundred million animals a year are killed in universities and major hospitals in this country," he said. Jentsch argues that same medical research using lab animals has lead to many medical breakthroughs that benefit mankind. UCLA points to research advances in breast cancer treatments, Parkinson's disease and artificial heart technology that relied on experiments involving lab animals at their California facilities. Jentsch's own research involves studies aimed at treating drug addiction in humans. He studies the brains of monkeys that have been injected with methamphetamine. He says his experiments are peer-reviewed and adhere strictly to established rules for the treatment of lab animals.  Watch supporters of animal research at protest » Jentsch says that he hopes that this week's dueling demonstrations can lead to a dialogue. He believes many of the protestors voicing opposition to the UCLA labs do not endorse the string of violent acts aimed against him and other researchers, "but it is essential for them to repudiate this type of activity." In the meantime, Jentsch says he refuses to be intimidated. "I'm going to continue to live where I live, continue to educate people about my work," he said. "I'm not going to stop."
Family, friends and classmates turned to prayer and Facebook on Wednesday amid an ongoing search in upstate New York for a missing college student. Jenni-Lyn Watson, 20, of Liverpool, was last seen Friday morning at her family's home, said Sgt. Robert Marshall of the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office. Watson was on a Thanksgiving break from Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. Liverpool is a suburb of Syracuse. "This [disappearance] is extremely uncharacteristic for Jenni-Lynn," said Marshall. Watson's parents reported her missing Friday night. The college junior's purse and other personal items were found at the home, but a Verizon LG enV3 phone is missing. One call was made on the phone from a heavily wooded area near other residences, said Marshall, who declined to provide details. The phone has since been turned off or is not operating, he said. Authorities are looking at records of Watson's cell phone calls. "We're still looking at everything," spokesman Sgt. John D'Eredita said Wednesday night. Detectives are following leads from numerous phone calls, but D'Eredita was not aware of any sightings of the young student. Authorities consider Watson's disappearance a missing-person case, Marshall said. Detectives traveled to Mercyhurst, where they met with faculty and staff, the Onandaga County Sheriff's Office said. Searchers had covered about 600 acres by Wednesday evening. Sheriff's deputies are trying to identify the driver of a dark pickup truck that was seen near her residence the day Watson disappeared, D'Eredita said. Watson is described as 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighing about 100 pounds. She has dirty blond hair and brown eyes. As of Wednesday afternoon, when simultaneous vigils were held for Watson, nearly 21,000 people had become members of a Facebook page about her disappearance. One of the church vigils was organized by the family; the other was held in a chapel at Mercyhurst College, a Catholic institution. "It was amazing today to see the turnout during fall break," college spokeswoman Debbie Morton said of the vigil held there. About 200 people attended, including members of the football team, which has a NCAA Division II game this weekend. "You felt overwhelming worry, but you still felt there was reason to hope," Morton said. Watson is a dance major and ballet dancer at Mercyhurst. "It is a highly disciplined area," Morton said of Watson's field of study. Authorities asked people with information to call 315-435-3081. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.
Elton John checked into a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday, where doctors diagnosed the 65-year-old singer with a serious respiratory infection, his publicist said Thursday. John was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after testing and treatment Wednesday, according to his publicist. John became ill while performing his "Million Dollar Piano" show at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last weekend, leading him to undergo testing at Cedars-Sinai on Wednesday. "Those tests resulted in the attending Cedars-Sinai physician recommending that Elton not perform any concerts for approximately seven days with complete rest and antibiotic treatment to cure his respiratory infection and prevent any damage," a statement from the publicist said. His shows Thursday, Saturday and Sunday at The Colosseum have been canceled, the statement said. "It feels strange not to be able to perform these 'Million Dollar Piano' concerts at The Colosseum," John said in the statement. "I love performing this show and I will be thrilled when we return to The Colosseum in October to complete the 11 concerts soon to be scheduled. All I can say to the fans is sorry I can't be with you." CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.
Investigators were trying to determine Wednesday what caused China's first fatal passenger plane crash in almost six years. A Henan Airlines flight with 96 people on board overshot a runway and crashed Tuesday night in the Yichun area of northern China, state media said. The plane broke into two pieces and burst into flames. On Wednesday, the government downgraded the death toll from the crash from 43 to 42 after a body that was torn apart was discovered to have been counted twice, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Fifty-four people survived. Five children injured in the crash were in critical condition, said Xinhua, citing doctors in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, where they had been transferred. Another 10 people were severely injured, it said. "The coming 48 hours are the dangerous period," said Wang Yongchen, deputy head of the No. 1 Hospital affiliated with Harbin Medical University. Four of the children suffered heavy respiratory tract burns, said Wang. The investigators' initial focus was to find the flight data recorder  -- commonly known as the "black box" -- that might yield clues as to what caused the Brazilian-made Embraer 190 jet to crash land in heavy fog on a patch of grass about 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) from the runway. The black box was found on the ground Wednesday morning, Xinhua said. Some passengers were thrown from the plane upon impact, according Xinhua, which cited the head of the publicity department of the Yichun city committee of the Communist Party of China. Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang led a team of transportation, health, work safety and security officials to Yichun after the crash, state media said. Two survivors told local television that the plane shook violently before it crashed and that thick smoke entered the cabin soon after impact. They said passengers were unable to open emergency exits after the wreck; survivors escaped through cracks in the fuselage. The plane was carrying 91 passengers, including five children, and five crew members when it crashed at 9:36 p.m. (9:36 a.m. ET), according to Xinhua, which cited a source with the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The Henan Airlines flight had taken off from Harbin on the 360-kilometer (225-mile) flight to Lindu Airport, about 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) from downtown Yichun, a city of about 1 million residents near the Russian border, Xinhua said. A Yichun vice-mayor told Xinhua that most of those taken to hospitals did not have life-threatening injuries. China's last fatal passenger airline accident occurred in November 2004, when a China Eastern commuter jet took off in frigid Inner Mongolia without de-icing and crashed shortly afterward into a nearby park, killing 55 people.

Protesters threw bricks and bottles Friday at police outside a mosque in London after about 1,000 people showed up to counter a planned a right-wing demonstration there, police said. Police arrest a protestor in Harrow, London, after fighting broke out at a planned right-wing demonstration. One person was arrested "to prevent a breach of the peace," police said in a statement. The right-wing demonstration's organizer, Stop Islamisation of Europe (SIOE), said on its Web site one of the demonstration's planners had been arrested. Seven other people were arrested during the melee for possession of "offensive weapons" -- including bottles of bleach, a hammer and a chisel, police said. Police said incidents at the scene began when the crowd -- believed to be either members of an anti-fascism group or there to provide support to the Harrow Central Mosque -- went after three youths, "caught up with them, and assaulted them," police said. "Police had to intervene to prevent the crowd from continuing with their attack." It was not immediately known if the youths were affiliated with any political group. Police said they had identified and stopped a number of people believed to be heading to the right-wing protest prior to the demonstration's start time, preventing them from reaching the area. It was not immediately known how many, if any, of the group's supporters had successfully arrived outside the mosque. "One person was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace as police believed if the SIOE demonstration started it would have resulted in serious disorder," police said. The group said on its Web site that the demonstration had been called off and that Stephen Gash, listed as one of the group's contacts, had been arrested "to prevent a breach of the peace." "If you are on your way to the demo, don't go, it's being called off right now," the post read. "The police can't handle the muslim counter demonstrators [sic]." The group describes itself on its Web site as an alliance of people "with the single aim of preventing Islam becoming a dominant political force in Europe." CNN's Phil Black contributed to this report.
"Still alive," Abu Omar said ruefully, responding to my question of "How have you been?" It's become something of a standard reply. We'd last seen each other in Damascus almost exactly a year ago, when Abu Omar and other activists devised an elaborate plan to smuggle us into the neighborhood of Kafarsouseh, right in the heart of the capital. Read more: Rebels in northern Syria pin hopes on airbase's downfall We had snuck out of our hotel at dark, changing taxis multiple times, trying to shake off any government spies who may have been following us. We'd devised a "signal": if my hat was on, it meant that we were fairly confident no one was behind us. If it was off, it would let Abu Omar know that we'd been tailed. He and the other activists knew only too well the price they would pay if caught. It was a gamble for sure -- one we were acutely aware would have significantly more serious consequences for those moving us around. Read more: Envoy: 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in Syria But for Abu Omar and his fellow activists it was well worth it. They were desperate to show the world that they were peaceful demonstrators, to prove that the Assad regime was violently targeting them. "We've put 20 people around the area, the neighborhood, to watch if any police are coming," he explained as we drove through the narrow alleyways of Kafarsouseh. Read more: 30 pro-regime forces killed in Syria blast Demonstrators stuck to the shadows, walking in groups of two to three to avoid attracting attention. At the signal they all emerged, chanting: "O how great is freedom." Flags unfurled, banners quickly plastered to walls, slogans scrawled on small bright pieces of paper rained down like confetti. It lasted all of 15 minutes before word came that Syrian security forces were moving in and we all bolted. For the activists, it was a victory: most demonstrations break up within minutes (if they were even able to gather at all.) That night we spent the next few hours laying low, moving through safehouses, meeting other activists, wounded demonstrators and the doctors who had secret clinics to treat them. Read more: Syrian opposition cannot agree on a new prime minister "I thought we would change the regime by demonstration, by peaceful demonstrations," Abu Omar sighs, reflecting on what he was thinking when we'd first met. We stayed in touch through Skype, with Abu Omar sending me links to demonstrations he'd filmed or small acts of defiance and bravery, like the day activists managed to unfurl the opposition flag briefly on a main Damascus overpass. The demonstrations grew and multiplied. Abu Omar says he believed that his neighborhood would become the heart of the opposition in the capital. Read more: Al-Assad touts plan for resolution, says enemies of Syria 'will go to hell' But at the end of February he was detained, part of a mass roundup in Kafarshouseh. He recalls his father coming in to wake him. "'They come for you,' he told me" Abu Omar recalls. "I didn't believe him and went back to sleep. Then my brother came running into the room and shook me, wake up now, they are here for you. I can't even describe the terror I felt, and I went numb." Abu Omar says he was beaten so badly in custody he still doesn't know how he managed to survive. By the time he was released early last summer, most of the young men we'd met at the demonstration had begun to pick up arms. "A lot of people joined the free Syrian army to protect the demonstration" he says, but that also changed, as more joined to protect their neighbourhood and their families. The messages I would receive over Skype grew grimmer ("We had another martyr today.") Read more: 'Humanitarian emergency' as Syria runs low on medical care, food The demonstrations and acts of defiance now seem like they hail from an age of innocence. Abu Omar says protests stopped around three months ago as the streets of Kafarsouseh crawled with Syrian security forces who regularly clash with rebel fighters. Once the scene of demonstrations, it now became yet another bloody battleground in Syria. Abu Omar himself was wounded in the arm after he too joined the rebel fighters, filming at the frontlines. One of the fighters who helped him, who he bonded with, was later killed as well. "I just wanted to see him before he was buried," Abu Omar says, pausing at the painful memory. "But I couldn't." He's also lost family members and friends. "Remember the man who was stabbed and beaten, who you met in the safehouse?" he asks. "When he recovered he went and trained with the doctors and was also training others in emergency first aid." He was killed in the -- a 27-year-old father of two young children, just one of countless casualties. Read more: Syrian refugees continue to flood Jordan amid warnings of crisis We also chatted about the rise in extremism, in radical Islamist units among the rebel fighting force. "We've been oppressed long enough," Abu Omar explains. "We aren't going to allow anyone to dictate to us any more. No one is going to be able to force us down a path we don't believe in" At the same time he acknowledges that yes, extremism is yet another challenge that the country is going to have to face, as those like him, dreamers of democracy, try to carve out the future Syria.

A few minutes of what was considered online fun, and one person is dead. Another is convicted of invasion of privacy and bias intimidation. When Rutgers student Dharun Ravi set up a spycam to catch roommate Tyler Clementi in a same-sex romantic moment, and when he tweeted about it and his plans to do it again, little did he think that Clementi would commit suicide or that he would face serious jail time and deportation. Ravi is learning his lesson the hard way. There are lessons for all of us: What you do online can hurt people. Despite the adage about sticks and stones, words can and do hurt -- especially when anyone can publish information that reaches millions. The Internet is full of homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic content. At a minimum, hate speech is online pollution, but it can go much further. It reinforces stereotypes and strengthens the belief that singling out "the other" for abuse is acceptable. Hate speech can harden low self-esteem and intimidate its targets -- and even lead people to commit suicide. Online bystanders have a responsibility. Some students in the Rutgers dorm were amused by Ravi's spycam-Twitter scheme. Others ignored it. They should have been outraged, and they should have done something about it. "If you see something, say something" is not an admonition restricted to the security realm. Tools are online for each of us to flag and report content that is objectionable. Many online companies have staffs to review such reports and to take action, from removing the offensive content to ejecting the person who posted it. Each of us should take responsibility to combat hate-filled content. Speak up: Clicking to report hate speech to an online host is not all we can do. Justice Louis Brandeis, in a 1927 Supreme Court case, extolled the virtues of "counter-speech" to address objectionable speech. That pre-Internet admonition applies full force to online messages today. Hate speech legitimizes discrimination, and many of the people who post it believe no one objects. So object. Speak up to counter the lies of hate speech or the inappropriate online conduct directed at minorities. Just as the Internet provides thoughtless haters with broadcasting tools, each of us has those same tools at our disposal. A little counter-speech can go a long way. It's time to get serious about cyber-literacy and ethics. The lack of education in schools about the rules that apply to online posting is appalling. Kids are left to their own devices, literally, with little guidance. Given the power in everyone's hands to cause injury -- and to be injured -- schools should provide serious discussions of what is appropriate online behavior. We are well past the time when adults can think of themselves as the digital immigrants who don't fully understand new technologies, compared with their kids, the digital natives who better understand the online world. Privacy is a shared responsibility. Discussions about privacy usually revolve around consumer privacy and protection. But in this era of social media, when everyone can be a publisher and broadcaster, individual responsibility to respect privacy should be the focus. Most people would know that secretly setting up a webcam to spy on someone is wrong. But posting embarrassing photos and videos and making thoughtless comments can be a wrongful invasion of privacy as well. Each of us has a responsibility to consider the privacy implications of what we do online. Homophobia is not funny. Finally, while young straight people today are much more accepting of gay people, an undercurrent of homophobia remains. Ravi most likely would not have set up a webcam to catch his roommate making out with a girl, nor would he have tweeted about it. In some quarters, the put-down "That's so gay" is still common parlance. Many think of gays and lesbians as "the other" and fair game for jokes. Racist and anti-Semitic jokes still have currency. Ravi may have thought what he was doing to his roommate was funny, but he now knows it was anything but, for Clementi and for himself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Wolf.
U.S. kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard, who gave birth to two children during her 18 years in captivity, said she did what she had to do to survive. During a wide-ranging interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that aired Sunday night, Dugard opened up about her experiences at the hands of her captors, Nancy and Philip Garrido. Dugard was just 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from the street in front of her South Lake Tahoe, California, home. The Garridos held her and her daughters in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until she was found in 2009. Dugard is now 31 and working to build a new life, one in which she and her children are finally free. "There's a switch that I had to shut off," she told Sawyer. "Just went someplace else." "I can't imagine being beaten to death, you know? And you can't imagine being kidnapped and raped, you know? So, it's just, you just do what you have to do to survive." Dugard recounted the first moment Phillip Garrido entered her life. She was on her way to school, wearing her favorite shirt and a ring in the shape of a butterfly her mother had given her, ABC reported, when all of a sudden Dugard felt "tingly" and "numb." Phillip Garrido had shocked her with a stun gun, the network said. The Garridos then put her in their car. She recalled Phillip Garrido laughing at one point, and telling his wife: "I can't believe we got away with it." "It was like the most horrible moment of your life times 10," Dugard told ABC. At first, she was handcuffed. Dugard said she tried not to cry because, with her hands behind her back, she couldn't wipe away her tears. Left on her face, they would itch, she said. Dugard also recalled the first time she gave birth, in the backyard, at just 14 years old. "I didn't know I was in labor," she said. "Then I saw her. She was beautiful. I felt like I wasn't alone anymore. (I) had somebody that was mine ... And I knew I could never let anything happen to her," she said. Throughout her 18-year ordeal, Dugard managed to hold onto the ring her mother had given her and the hope that she would one day be reunited with her family, ABC reported. "I wanted to see her more than anything," she said about her mother. "I would cry every day. (It was) hardest when I would think about her and what she was doing and then -- trying to convince myself she was better without me. "Worried I'd forget what she looked like, or what she sounded like. Would she forget me?" Her mother, Terry Probyn, also appeared in the ABC interview. Last month, a judge sentenced Phillip Garrido to 431 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 12 counts of sexual assault. Nancy Garrido got 36 years to life in prison for her role in the crimes, including kidnapping and one count of rape by force. The couple pleaded guilty in late April in El Dorado Superior Court. A statement from Dugard, read by her mother at the sentencing hearing, called the Garridos "evil" and described her kidnapping by them as a "sexual perversion." During the ABC interview, she stressed she is moving on with her life. Dugard said she wants to study writing, the network reported. She spoke out just days before her memoir, "A Stolen Life," is scheduled to be released. The book is due in stores Tuesday. "Why not look at it? Stare it down until it can't scare you anymore," Dugard said about her nearly two decades in captivity. "I didn't want there to be any more secrets."
a period possibly covering her two flights on Frontier Airlines. Frontier spokesman Todd Lehmacher said that, by early Friday evening, airline officials had contacted as many as 800 passengers, including those on Vinson's October 10 flight to Cleveland, her October 13 return flight to Dallas and five other trips taken by the latter plane before it was taken out of service. The CDC, even as it said these passengers have an extremely low chance of getting Ebola, is reaching out to those on Vinson's flights. Vinson is one of two nurses at Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who became ill with Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who was the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and died October 8. She was hospitalized Tuesday, one day after her return flight from Ohio, where she was visiting family and planning her wedding. Vinson was moved Wednesday  to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. The other nurse, Nina Pham, is being treated at a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland. Authorities initially said Vinson had a slightly elevated temperature of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 Celsius), which was below the fever threshold for Ebola, but didn't show any Ebola symptoms on her Monday flight. This is significant because a person isn't contagious with Ebola, which spreads through the transmission of bodily fluids, until he or she has symptoms of the disease. Her uncle, Lawrence Vinson, said Thursday night his niece didn't feel sick until the morning after her return to Dallas. And the CDC's Dr. Chris Braden said Friday that Vinson didn't have classic Ebola symptoms like a sore throat, fever or muscle aches on her trip. But Braden said that she may have started feeling off on October 11, and investigators couldn't rule out her illness starting the previous day -- when she flew from Texas to Ohio. "She rested for a long time on some days; she said she felt funny," he said of Vinson's state during her trip. "Those types of things, but nothing specific." Ebola in U.S.: Who has it, who doesn't, who might Belize refuses to let possible Ebola case disembark The Frontier passengers and crew members aren't the only ones to find themselves thrust into the Ebola story. So, too, are 16 people being monitored in northeast Ohio -- including two employees at a bridal store Vinson visited -- because they were in the vicinity of or had contact with her, health officials there say. There also are 48 people who had contact with Duncan in Texas before he was hospitalized. Their 21-day monitoring period, during which their movement has been restricted, will end Sunday, at the latest. "Monday afternoon is when we're going to start piecing our lives together," Aaron Yah said. Yah said he is the husband of Youngor Jallah, the daughter of Duncan's fiancee. Yah said he hadn't been able to go to work the past three weeks. Then there are the 76 health care workers involved in Duncan's treatment, one of whom is now in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and a diplomatic kerfuffle. That Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital worker did not have direct contact with Duncan, but "may have had contact with his specimen," the U.S. State Department said on Friday. It has been 19 days since that may have happened -- two days shy of the maximum 21-day Ebola incubation period. Carnival CEO Arnold Donald told CNN's Richard Quest the woman is a lab supervisor and "has no symptoms whatsoever." Even so, she was isolated on the ship. "We have a lot of experience in the cruise industry," said Donald, citing diseases such as SARS, H1N1 and the flu. "... The CDC has protocols in place; we're following those protocols." The vessel is heading back to Galveston, Texas, with the passenger on board. But that's not what the U.S. government wanted. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the plan was for the passenger to get on land in Belize, then be flown back to the United States. The Belize government refused to let the passenger leave the ship, given the potential Ebola exposure, despite a plea from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to Belize Prime Minister Dean Barrow. "There's a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of fear about this disease, much of it not rooted in actual facts," Harf said, adding that Belize authorities "could have handled (this situation) differently." Belize's government responded Friday night, in a statement in which it also announced it is barring travel from Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, by saying it "regrets (being) unable to move" the Dallas hospital worker "and her traveling companion" onshore for evacuation from an international airport. "This decision was made out of preponderance of caution for the welfare of the citizens and residents of Belize," said the government, which didn't dispute that the passenger was low risk. Nurse: My neck was exposed All but a few of the thousands of documented Ebola cases originated in West Africa. Yet it's the two cases that spread here -- Vinson and Pham -- that have caused a fury in Texas, fueling fears and complaints about the procedures meant to keep health care workers safe. One of those affected is Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse Briana Aguirre. She said Thursday that the Dallas hospital didn't give her proper gear while she cared for Pham, even though it was more than a week into the Ebola response there. Aguirre told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the gear she was given -- when she cared for Pham for one day -- included a Tyvex suit, gloves and booties that covered most of her body, but not her neck. "I just told them, 'Why would an area so close to my mouth and my nose ... be exposed?' " Aguirre told Cooper. "And they didn't have an answer." She said she asked supervisors about new gear and was told it had been ordered. But she said the better equipment should have been procured more quickly, and raised concerns for her colleagues who were more involved in Ebola care. "I just know that the (two) nurses that have been infected, they were dealing with the same equipment while they were dealing with so much more than I dealt with personally," she said. "They put their lives on the line and without the proper equipment." She also said that prior to Duncan's arrival in late September, nurses at the hospital had no mandatory Ebola training and only an optional seminar. The hospital has said its professionals wore equipment consistent with CDC guidelines at the time. Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC's director, admitted at a congressional hearing Wednesday that "some forms of" health care workers' protective equipment "did allow exposure of some parts of the skin." Given such concerns and the fact Pham and Vinson got Ebola at work, the CDC "very soon" will put out updated guidelines on putting on and removing protective gowns, masks, gloves and other gear, agency spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said Friday. Kerry: 'We have to do more' in West Africa There have been eight confirmed cases of Ebola in the United States: Duncan, three missionaries, an NBC News freelance cameraman and a World Health Organization doctor infected in Africa, plus the two Texas nurses. The missionaries have all been released from hospitals, while the others are being cared for at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, Nebraska Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health hospital in suburban Washington. U.S. authorities' response goes well beyond providing medical care. Federal, state and local governments, Customs and Border Protection, various health agencies and even the U.S. military have all played a part in the response so far. Thousands of American troops will help in West Africa, performing duties such as flying in supplies, building field hospitals and helping local authorities with logistics. Several U.S. military officials told CNN on Friday that the Defense Department is considering sending anywhere from a dozen to 100 of its health care professionals to help CDC officials in the region. The Obama administration also will appoint Ron Klain -- former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore -- as his "Ebola czar" in an effort to help streamline America's response. There's also a press to recruit other countries to devote their own resources and money to help stem the months-long outbreak in West Africa, where all but a few of the roughly 9,200 reported Ebola cases and 4,555 deaths have occurred, according to the World Health Organization. Kerry, the U.S. secretary of state, expressed disappointment Friday in the international response, saying "we are barely one-third of the way" to hitting the United Nations' $1 billion fundraising goal for the Ebola fight. "We have to do more and we have to do it quickly," Kerry said. "... If we don't adequately address this current outbreak now, then Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio that we will end up fighting -- all of us -- for decades."
work that, according to the AP and Washington Post reports, was done off the books. As a results of the investigation, three CIA employees were fired and seven others were disciplined, the source said. At least two of the three people fired have been rehired by other government agencies, a source told CNN, confirming information first reported by the AP. "They fired their own people and then took care of them," the source said. The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the matter, according to the source. So far, the source said, no one has been charged. Justice Department spokesman Andrew Ames declined to comment. Where is Levinson? Levinson's whereabouts remain unclear. During an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in September, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani offered little when asked what he could tell Levinson's family. "We don't know where he is, who he is," Rouhani said. "He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him." In 2011, the State Department said new evidence suggested that Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was alive and being held somewhere in southwest Asia. This year, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, "we have every reason to believe that he's alive and that the Iranians control his fate." Last month, Levinson became the longest held American hostage in history. At the time, Levinson's family members told CNN's New Day that they were worried because they haven't had any word since they received five photos in 2011. The pictures show Levinson in an orange jumpsuit, holding messages. "We have not received any recent information about him," said his wife, Christine Levinson, "although I do believe he is safe and will come home to us soon."

A British man was jailed Tuesday for raping two of his daughters and fathering nine children over 27 years, a case with echoes of Austria's Josef Fritzl. The two daughters were made pregnant 19 times; there were nine births, five miscarriages and five terminations. Seven of the children are alive but suffer genetic deformities. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons banning the identification of his victims and the surviving children, pleaded guilty Tuesday at Sheffield Crown Court, northern England, and was sentenced to serve 25 life sentences to run concurrently. The judge said the minimum term the 56-year-old rapist should serve in jail should be 19½ years. South Yorkshire Police Chief Superintendent Simon Torr said, "The victims of these terrible crimes have asked me to state the following: 'His detention in prison brings us only the knowledge that he cannot physically touch us again. The suffering he has caused will continue for many years, and we must now concentrate our thoughts on finding the strength to rebuild our lives.' " Speaking for the police, Torr added, "The main concern ... is for those who have been so badly affected: the victims who have suffered a terrible ordeal. We will continue to offer them our full support to try and help them get on with their lives. "As far as the sentence goes, we are satisfied that this offender has received the strongest possible punishment for his heinous crimes. Now we need to ensure continuing support for those who have suffered as a result of his actions." The daughters first told police about their ordeal in June, but the abuse dated to 1981. It emerged that in 1998 one daughter rang Childline, a charity to help abused kids, and asked for assurances about being able to keep her children if she came forward. When Childline could not make that guarantee, the daughter did nothing more to raise her plight.  Watch how the case came to light » The UK's Press Association reported that the rapes began in 1981 with daily attacks and that for long periods, they would be raped up to three times a week, and the assaults would continue through pregnancies. Their only reprieve came after they had just given birth or when they were ill because of the abuse. If either daughter tried to refuse their father's attacks, they would be punched, kicked and or held to the flames of a gas fire, burning their eyes and arms, PA reported. Despite visiting hospitals and meeting with social workers over the 27 years of abuse, no investigation was launched into the family. The case comes in the wake of the death of a baby, known only as Baby P, which has dominated headlines in Britain. The baby endured horrendous torture and died despite being on the local authority's child protection register. In Austria this year, Josef Fritzl was arrested, accused of keeping his daughter in a basement dungeon and fathering seven children through the rapes.
For a championship with a distinctly Iberian streak, it is no surprise that South America should be high on MotoGP's list of territories to conquer. This weekend its hordes land in Argentina for the third round of the 2014 season. This vast nation is not entirely unfamiliar with top-class motorcycle racing, but this is still very much the case of an old friend arriving unexpectedly from out of town. The last time Argentinean fans heard the roar of grand prix bikes was in 1999, when current champion Marc Marquez was just six years old. Nevertheless, enthusiasm for the sport in these parts is clear. Spectators will be traveling to the circuit in Santiago del Estero, many by motorcycle, from across the country. Back in March, as Marquez and co. lined up on the grid for the season's opening race in Qatar, 65,000 tickets had already been sold. The grandstands around this redesigned and redeveloped circuit -- crafted by Italian Jarno Zaffelli -- are expected to be full. "They have done a brilliant job," Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP's commercial rightsholder Dorna, told CNN. "We felt a very warm welcome since the first time we started negotiating with them." After a protracted absence the Spaniard believes the time is right for the series to return to South America, with Argentina having met the required standards of motorcycling's ruling body the FIM. "There is interest in MotoGP in this country, and a circuit and track at the best level possible, with FIM homologation, and with the government of Santiago del Estero completely committed and involved in the project," said Ezpeleta. "Argentina is a country that deserves to have MotoGP." One thing that should make this weekend's racing particularly intriguing is the fact that the Termas de Rio Hondo circuit is unfamiliar to all of the riders. "This is a new circuit for everyone and we have to interpret it well," said Yamaha's seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi, who was second at the season-opener in Qatar. "We'll have to understand as soon as possible the ideal setup of the bike, and above all we'll have to understand how the tires behave on this asphalt." Rossi's teammate Jorge Lorenzo, among the favorites for the title after running Marquez to the wire last year, is anxious to repair the damage wrought by a nightmarish start to his campaign. After crashing on the first lap in Qatar, the Spaniard compounded his misery with an extraordinary false start at the year's second race in Austin, Texas. Lined up on the grid, he had apparently been distracted by mosquitoes on his visor, and sped away before the lights turned green. It was a bizarre and costly error, which was punished with a ride-through penalty, and his 10th-place finish cast him adrift of the championship leaders after just two races. "It's not easy to swallow what happened at Austin but I always try to get the positive thing even if we are in trouble," the 2010 and 2012 world champion said before traveling to Argentina. "Staying on track is the best way to forget and I think our championship is going to kick off over there." Lorenzo has spent the last fortnight resting and training in the Mexican resort of Cancun. "I will arrive with plenty of energy," he said. One rider who won't be making the trip is Ducati's Cal Crutchlow, who is recovering from a painful crash at his last outing. After dislocating and breaking a finger the Briton had a pin inserted in the bone and will stay home for treatment. "I'm very sad to let the team down like this because I was really looking forward to racing," he said. "Unfortunately I'm still feeling too much pain in my right hand." Across the Ducati garage, however, Andrea Dovizioso is still on a high after a surprise third-place finish in the U.S. "When you are able to obtain these results, which seem almost impossible, it is truly a great feeling," said the Italian, who is relishing the chance to maintain his momentum in Argentina. "I always like to race on new circuits and so I am very curious and motivated." Ezpeleta is delighted by the apparent buzz among the riders as they step into the unknown. "The whole paddock is excited because it's a new track," he said. "Having a new track is motivation, and especially we want to see the feedback of the riders. The ones who were testing here in July were totally happy and satisfied with the circuit. I also want to see the response of the fans." Honda's two riders, Marquez and Dani Pedrosa, are also feeling pretty satisfied with life.  After finishing just behind his victorious teammate in Austin, Pedrosa has been studiously preparing for this weekend. "I've tried to do some homework with maps and videos and find our as much as I could before arriving," he said, "but it's hard to say something not being on the bike." Marquez, whose dominant performances in the opening rounds were all the more remarkable given that he was recovering from a broken leg, is oozing confidence. "We will be looking to continue the momentum from the first two races," the 21-year-old said. Few would bet against him doing so. In spite of Honda and Marquez's apparent iron grip on the lead, Ezpeleta is satisfied with the start of this year's championship, and believes the new Open Class rules have been a success so far. "The regulations were created to reduce the costs and increase the spectacle, and I think we have accomplished these things," he told CNN. "I'm sure in the future races this season we will have some spectacular battles on track." As far as the MotoGP circus itself is concerned, Ezpeleta indicated that the series may look to extend its reach into more new territories before too long. "We would like to expand in South America, as well as Asia," he said. "Brazil is interested in hosting a MotoGP." The MotoGP chief also hinted that an African grand prix may be a possibility. The last top-class race on the continent was held a decade ago, at South Africa's Phakisa Freeway in 2004. "I would like to have a grand prix in Africa, as we did in the past," added Ezpeleta. "I can't predict the future, but I would like to have a race there and it's always good to open new frontiers; but right now it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen in Africa." Fans and administrators alike will also be hoping for some unpredictability this weekend in Argentina; Honda's challengers need to take advantage of this new frontier.
LinkedIn announced a new platform Wednesday for its business-focused social networking site -- offering websites and developers easy tools to embed "recommend" buttons, company-profile boxes and contact widgets on third-party websites -- as well as a way to log in to other sites using LinkedIn. Calling it "a new platform for building the professional web," LinkedIn is seeking to challenge Facebook's growing control over online identity. Once just a site for sharing photos and updates with friends, Facebook has woven itself into the fabric of the net with its Open Graph platform, that lets other websites embed Facebook widgets, install "Like" buttons, plug-in a commenting system, and let users log in with their Facebook credentials. Though LinkedIn's new platform doesn't mention Facebook by name, the term "Professional Web" clearly shows the company trying to position itself as a more mature and respectable alternative to Facebook. The new tools rely on JavaScript APIs and the OAuth 2.0 system for logins (the same as used by Yahoo, Google and Twitter, among others). Among the offerings: -- A Share button that posts a link to a page or news story to the user's feed on LinkedIn. -- A Recommend button to give a vote to a product you like. WIRED: LinkedIn scores $53 million -- Member profile widgets that show the LinkedIn profile of a company executive or website owner. LinkedIn's Share button joins a growing number of plugins that try to get users to spread the news about a site or news story, a pantheon that includes Facebook's Like, Twitter's Tweet button, and social voting and submission widgets from Digg and Reddit. For those who run their own blogs or websites, LinkedIn is making it simple to show off a snippet of your LinkedIn profile and for visitors logged into LinkedIn, they'll see thumbnails of connections they have in common. Companies can also embed widgets that shows off employee profiles or profiles of companies featured on their site or in a news story, showing off the ones that are "in" your network. The box can also be configured to show off key information about the company -- and a link to its official LinkedIn page -- instead of employee profiles. WIRED: LinkedIn to lay of 10% of staff It's a powerful challenge. LinkedIn has a solid and growing user base, one that's shown it's willing to pay for extra features. The company is preparing for an IPO, and extending the power of LinkedIn's focus on business, not pleasure, outside of its online walls could help the company grow into a powerful competitor to Facebook. WIRED: Let IPOs bloom again -- LinkedIn files with SEC It would be the "real world" site that people graduate to, from the college fun of Facebook. Unfortunately, LinkedIn's platform faces the tough challenge of coming almost a year after Facebook debuted its Like button and its Open Graph API. In social networking years, it feels like almost a decade, and LinkedIn will have to work hard to convince websites and busy developers that it's worth their time to graduate to the "professional web," as well.

It's hard to keep up with so many statistics about modern parenting, but here's one that floored me when I heard it a few years ago: By 4, children living in poverty hear 30 million fewer words than children in higher income households, according to researchers. Thirty million! That is horrendous, but it gets worse: Hearing fewer words leads to learning fewer words, which means children start kindergarten with smaller vocabularies and a so-called "word gap." Often, they can't catch up when it comes to academic readiness and long-term achievement, studies have found. This week, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced new guidelines that encourage doctors to talk to parents not just about nutrition and illnesses but about the importance of reading out loud, singing and talking during an infant's first days. "Fewer than half of children younger than 5 years old are read to daily in our country," the group's president, James M. Perrin, said in a statement. "The benefits are so compelling that encouraging reading at young children's check-ups has become an essential component of our care." Pediatricians see 16 million children 5 and younger every year in the United States, said Patti Miller, co-director of Too Small to Fail, a joint initiative of the Clinton Foundation and Next Generation, which is focused on helping parents close the "word gap" and improve the lives of children. "So getting this word out through pediatricians and having them recommend to parents and support reading out loud to their children starting in infancy is so amazing and critically important," Miller said. My husband and I read aloud to our girls, 6 and 8, every day from the minute they were born, and we still do it during breakfast or before bedtime. Their love of reading shows us they have certainly benefited, and it truly pains me to think about their peers who might have missed out before enrolling in elementary school. President Barack Obama, in a video released by the White House on Wednesday, saluted the move by the doctor's group in connection with Too Small to Fail to help "bridge the word gap'" and increase children's chances of success later in life. "We know that ... if a black or Latino child isn't ready for kindergarten, they're half as likely to finish middle school with strong academic and social skills," Obama said. "By giving more of our kids access to high-quality preschool and other early learning programs -- and by helping parents get the tools they need to help their kids succeed -- we can give those kids a better shot at the career they're capable of, and the life that will make us all better off." The key is getting the message to parents who too often don't realize the importance of reading aloud, talking and singing in the early years, Miller said. "While this is a big gap, the good news is that the solution is pretty straightforward and we know that if we can get this important message out to parents about why you need to talk, read and sing, it can go a long way in terms of ameliorating this word gap," she added. The mission has some bipartisan support. Too Small to Fail released videos Wednesday of Cindy McCain, wife of Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, former GOP Sen. Bill Frist and Hillary Clinton, who are teaming up to raise awareness about the importance of early literacy. Clinton talked about how she sang to her daughter, Chelsea, every night when she was a baby. When Chelsea finally mouthed "No sing, mommy, no sing," Clinton went back to reading, she said in the video. "Singing, reading or just talking is an important part of not only my daughter's brain development, but every child's," Clinton said. "Thanks to new research, we know that children's brains light up and make new connections when their parents speak to them from the earliest days, but many of our youngest kids aren't getting the support they need to grow and thrive." Said Cindy McCain, "As a parent and former teacher, I'm very familiar with the way a child's eyes light up when he or she first starts to understand a new concept. Every moment a parent spends with a child, talking, singing, reading a bedtime story is an opportunity to make a lifelong impact in the child's life." As part of the effort, Scholastic Inc. is donating 500,000 books for children up to 3 years old during the next year. The books will be distributed to 20,000 medical providers nationwide to be given to families during pediatrician visits. The American Academy of Pediatricians and Too Small to Fail are also developing a toolkit to help doctors teach parents how they can add more communication with their infants and toddlers to every day activities such as diaper changes, meal time, bath time and bus rides. "Parents don't have a lot of extra time. They're working, they're often working multiple jobs and doing their best to get everything done in a day so what we're trying to do is make these tips very simple and straightforward," Miller said. If you have an infant or a toddler or you know anyone who does, encourage them to sing, talk and read aloud to their littlest ones. Those activities are just as important as making sure they get all the food and sleep they need to thrive.

The number making Mike Podhorzer anxious these days is 15. That's the lead Democrats have over Republicans among working class voters in the final days of the 2014 midterm elections, according to his polling at the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor federation. That might seem good for Democrats, but in modern times, the party always wins voters making $50,000 or less. For Podhorzer, the AFL-CIO's political director and one of the Democratic party's top thinkers on voter turnout, it's the spread that matters. "Democratic victories are powered by the votes of the people who are more financially stressed," Podhorzer said in an interview with CNN at the labor federation's Washington offices, just up the street from the White House. "That's been the case going back to the New Deal. When working class people turn out and vote Democratic, that more than compensates for the advantage that Republicans have among upper income voters." In other words, with GOP dependably winning upper-income Americans, it's up to Democrats to run up the numbers with downscale voters, who made up about 40% of the electorate in the last election. When Democrats clobber Republicans nationally among working class voters — as they did by 22 points in 2012 — they win. When the margin is tighter — it was only an 11-point win for Democrats in 2010 — they lose. The 55-40 lead Democrats are clinging to among people making under $50,000 is wider than the 50-39 lead they had earlier this summer, making this year's outcome harder to predict. Podhorzer said it does explain why Democrats are still in the hunt heading into next Tuesday, suggesting that next week's election won't resemble the GOP tidal wave of 2010. But it still makes him nervous. Too many Democratic campaigns have failed to rally their working class base, Podhorzer said, choosing instead to run on wedge issues -- like Sen. Mark Udall's relentless opposition to a personhood amendment in Colorad -- rather than broader economic populism. "It's very dangerous," he said. "I think that picking niche issues and trying to run on a collection of issues and contrasts in this environment is less effective than mobilizing the voters they need to turn out." "Throughout this cycle, polls have shown Republican voters to be more enthusiastic, because Democrats have been taking an approach in general that's more about slicing into independent voters and into the middle, and has left the base fairly unmotivated," he said. The Democrats who have nurtured working class voters with an economic message — like Gary Peters in Michigan and Al Franken in Minnesota — aren't getting much national attention, he said, because they have pulled away from their opponents and aren't being covered by the horse-race-obsessed media. Tight races are not breaking open in the final days, an indicator of "the cynicism and apathy that people have." But even with a motivated base, Podhorzer said Republicans are still not where they would like to be heading into Election Day. "It's really remarkable how many close races there are right now," he said. "And unlike 2010, Republicans are not making inroads into blue territory. In 2010, they were able to win Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and so forth. This time around they may be able to win races like Colorado or others, but they are not changing the presidential map at all. They have their work to do to figure out how to get the map from the way it looks now to a winning map in 2016." Podhorzer, an engineer of the progressive movement's superior voter turnout machinery, said the battle on election day will be about get-out-the-vote mechanics. He framed the contest as a test of the GOP's "wholesale GOTV" — paid media and base enthusiasm in a good Republican year — versus the "retail GOTV" of the Democratic coalition that relies on the party's technological advantages and focuses on person-to-person contact and. WATCH: Hillary Clinton clarifies 'jobs' remarks The AFL-CIO's super PAC, Worker's Voice, is part of the field program Democrats are counting on in tough Senate and gubernatorial races in place like North Carolina, Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. "The Democrats' retail GOTV has gotten much, much stronger than in 2010, when the base was even more disillusioned," he said. "Democrats will do a better job on retail GOTV, and have more of the personal networks on the ground to pull people out. It's going to be interesting to see how effective that can be."
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented a united stance with Haitian President Rene Preval during her visit Saturday to the quake-battered capital. Clinton, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the country since Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, sought to assure the Haitian people that the United States is working with the government "to assist in every way we can." "We are here at the invitation of your government to help you," she said. "As President Obama has said, we will be here today, tomorrow and for the time ahead." Clinton said she and Preval will issue a joint communique Sunday "setting forth our intention to cooperate together." Clinton arrived in Haiti via a U.S. Coast Guard plane Saturday afternoon and immediately went into meetings with Preval, Rajiv Shah, the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and other U.S. officials already on the ground. Get the latest developments in Haiti "We had a very good meeting about all of the priorities of the Haitian government and the Haitian people," Clinton said after a brief news conference following the meetings. She said air efforts are focused on providing water, food and medical help. She also stressed the importance of restoring the country's communications networks, electricity and transportation. "We agreed that we will be coordinating closely together to achieve these goals." In an interview with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, Clinton said "every day we are making progress and I expect that to continue." In addition to the immediate needs, Clinton said the focus will switch next week to long-term recovery and reconstruction, telling Gupta she believed that Haiti, with the help of the international community, could be a better place than it was before Tuesday's quake. The U.S. Coast Guard plane she arrived on was carrying 100 cases of water, 100 cases of meals-ready-to-eat, and food and toiletries for about 140 U.S. Embassy staff members. Fifty Americans, who have been waiting to be evacuated, will fly back to the United States when Clinton departs. Clinton landed hours after President Obama announced Saturday that former Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush have agreed to lead an effort to raise funds for Haiti. Frustrations continued to mount in the earthquake-pummeled country as survivors remained in dire need of food, water and medical aid. One medical official warned that a third of the patients at a makeshift hospital -- one of many being erected in open fields, abandoned stadiums and empty warehouses around the capital -- were in need of immediate surgery, and could die without it. "They will die of infections, they'll die of dead tissue, they'll die of malnutrition and metabolic derangements," Dr. Jennifer Furin with the Harvard Medical School said of the roughly 300 patients at the hospital on a U.N. compound near Port-au-Prince's airport. Elsewhere, a food drop by U.S. helicopters in Port-au-Prince became a chaotic scene as hundreds of Haitians without food and water for four days rushed the boxes of aid being shoved out of the open doors. A similar scene erupted Friday when a food convoy with the World Food Programme was forced to leave an area after men in the crowd starting pushing and shoving their way to the trucks. Impact Your World Amid the chaos, there were signs of progress: more aid distribution sites and hospitals, a system for identifying the dead and even more survivors rescued from the ruins of buildings. U.S. troops handed out about 2,500 meals in Petionville on Saturday and 14 aid distribution points had been established. The Israel Defense Forces began operating a field hospital at an abandoned soccer field, and the U.S. Naval Hospital Ship Comfort, staffed by a crew of 64 and 560 hospital personnel, left the Baltimore Harbor on a trip that will take about five days. Increasingly, Haitians were seen helping Haitians. One local church was able to scrounge up some potato chips, bottled water and juice to hand out. Local authorities were seen setting up a makeshift clinic on a street corner in Port-au-Prince with one doctor and a couple of tables and folding chairs. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Edmond Mulet said common grave sites were being created for the thousands of victims, calling mass graves discovered by CNN crews Friday "not very dignified." He said the dead will be photographed in hopes of providing identification for families. While there has not been an official count of the dead, Mulet said the number of casualties in the capital, which has a population of 3 million, ranges from 100,000 to 150,000. He said Friday 13,000 bodies had been recovered so far. The State Department has put the American death toll at 15 so far. U.S. officials said search and rescue operations will continue through the weekend. As of Saturday afternoon, 22 people had been rescued since Tuesday from collapsed buildings by U.S. urban search and rescue teams. At least one man was pulled from the rubble on Saturday and other crews were working to reach others. Tapping noises were heard at a collapsed day-care center, but later stopped. One trapped person apparently was sending text messages from beneath a collapsed bank. Meanwhile, the Port-au-Prince airport remained overwhelmed by the influx of air traffic bringing in supplies and efforts continued to clear the roads. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who confirmed Saturday the deaths of the top two civilian officials at Haiti's U.N. mission, was to arrive in the capital Sunday. On Friday, the United Nations said that at least 37 U.N. personnel have died -- 36 with the U.N. mission and one with the World Food Programme. The number of unaccounted for U.N. people exceeded 300. There are 12,000 people working for U.N. entities in Haiti.

A number of Chipotle employees across Minnesota were fired after an immigration audit targeted the restaurant chain for allegedly hiring undocumented workers, officials said. "We are not disclosing a number of people displaced by this," company spokesman Chris Arnold said Monday. "We did lose some restaurant employees in Minnesota following a document review by Immigration and Customs Enforcement." The review took place last month and is likely reflective of a shift away from work-site crackdowns against employees -- considered a hallmark practice under the Bush administration -- and toward so-called "I-9 audits," which instead focus on the hiring practices of their employers, according to analysts and a U.S. Immigration official who declined to be named. The I-9 form is an employment eligibility document meant to determine a person's ability to work legally in the United States. "At the end of the day, the goal is to ensure that the companies have an authorized, legal workforce and also that employers are aware of their responsibility to ensure the people they hire are lawful," the official said. The I-9 strategy is believed to be a more effective use of the agency's investigative resources, putting the onus on the audited company to take corrective action, the official added. Chipotle has "done what ICE has asked of us and are looking to put that incident behind us," Arnold said. The crackdown coincides with recent judiciary hearings in Arizona in which lawmakers debated proposals to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Nearly one-third of America's 38 million immigrants are illegal, just under four percent of the total U.S. population, according to recent reports from the Pew Hispanic Research Center and the Brookings Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Of those, many are employed in low-wage restaurants jobs. But analysts debate the broader economic impact of illegal immigration in the United States. Critics often blame the large undocumented workforce for siphoning public resources while forcing a drop in wages or displacing low-skilled U.S.-born workers. Advocates say consumers benefit from lower prices as a result of the lower wages paid to illegal workers, arguing that they fill unskilled labor gaps and create work opportunities for higher-skilled, higher-paid workers who are often native born. Illegal immigration "nationally, doesn't seem to make a significant difference" to the broader U.S. economy, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who studies U.S. immigration policy. "The real impact is at local levels," Singer said, pointing to state and local law enforcement, schools and health care systems that pay for an undocumented workforce that may or may not contribute tax revenue for services rendered. But as record unemployment rates affect cities and towns across the country, immigrants -- particularly illegal immigrants -- are being targeted, she said.

Rapper Fat Joe has been "officially cleared" after Wisconsin police investigated an alleged sexual assault reported by a woman last weekend, according to his lawyer. The 33-year-old Madison, Wisconsin, woman called police with a complaint of "inappropriate touching" after Fat Joe -- whose real name is Joseph Cartagena -- performed at the city's Orpheum Theater on Sunday night, a police report said. The woman said the incident happened inside a limousine with Fat Joe and other male subjects, the police report said. "Fat Joe had no contact with and never spoke to his accuser," attorney Dawn Florio said in a statement Thursday night. "He was questioned for a few minutes at his hotel room and was never detained by the police." CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.
A legally insane killer who escaped in Washington state during a field trip to a fair was recaptured Sunday, the Spokane County Sheriff's Department said. Authorities combed Washington state for Phillip Paul, a killer who escaped Thursday during a field trip. Phillip Paul, who was on the run for three days, had been planning the break for "at least the last several months," Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich said at a news conference. Paul was recaptured at about 4 p.m. PT in Goldendale, Washington, sheriff's Sgt. Dave Reagan said. Goldendale is about 250 miles from the site of Paul's escape from a county fair in Spokane County, Washington. Police received a tip Saturday afternoon that Paul was dropped off by a person he managed to dupe into giving him a ride to Goldendale, Knezovich said. Police spotted him hiding in a wooded area about 100 yards from the drop-off point Sunday and eventually arrested him while he was trying to hitch another ride, Knezovich said. Sheriff's officials told CNN affiliate KREM-TV that Paul also escaped briefly in 1991 and assaulted a law enforcement officer. That same officer was involved in arresting Paul on Sunday, Reagan said. Paul, 47, escaped at around noon Thursday. Though Paul had been confined in a mental institution because of a murder confession, he was allowed to go on the trip to the county fair. Paul had packed all his personal belongings in a large backpack before leaving on the trip, which the sheriff said should have been a sign that Paul was "about ready to do something this drastic." Paul was committed to Eastern State Hospital after admitting he strangled and slit the throat of community activist Ruth Motley in 1987, KREM-TV reported. According to court documents obtained by KREM, Paul believed Motley was a witch and killed her in response to voices in his head. He subsequently burned a deer carcass as a sacrifice, according to the documents. Paul's escape Thursday prompted a massive manhunt and brought criticism from many, including state government officials and police. "There was an extreme amount of anger throughout the law enforcement community that this event even took place," Knezovich said. "This is a situation, in my opinion, that should have never happened." Knezovich also complained that hospital officials had not reported Paul's escape for two hours, which he said also hindered the investigation. A review of the policy that allows patients to take trips has been launched, said Susan Dreyfus, secretary of the Washington's Department of Social and Health Services. Dreyfus said she was concerned about Paul's escape and another recent brief escape by a patient at a different local mental facility.
It should have been the proudest moment in his life -- instead Ahmed Abdul Zaher finds himself embroiled in controversy and his career in doubt after scoring the goal that helped his club win this year's African Champions League. The 28-year-old's first reaction -- prior to being wrestled to the floor by his Al Ahly teammates in celebration -- was to hold out four fingers in a gesture that has become synonymous with ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy. Known as 'Rabaa', which means four, the salute is considered the symbol of defiance against military rule and refers to the Rabaa Al-Adawiya mosque where supporters of Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood clashed with the army in August, resulting in hundreds of deaths. Even though Zaher claims his actions had no political meaning, the tense political situation in Egypt was highlighted by the strength of the sanctions meted out to him by Al Ahly's board on Tuesday. The forward has not only been put up for sale but also barred from competing in next month's FIFA Club World Cup -- a tournament that carries special significance in Africa since it affords teams a rare chance to play with the world watching while testing themselves against some of the planet's best players. In a statement that explained the club's "firm rejection of mixing politics and sport", Al Ahly also revealed that Abdul Zaher will also miss out on any financial bonus gained from the club's continental triumph. Supporters of the stringent sanctions will argue that Abdul Zaher's actions could have had serious repercussions as Cairo hosted a major football match with fans in attendance for one of the few times since last year's stadium disaster in Port Said. The rampage in February 2012 left 74 people dead and 1,000 injured after the Port Said home team, al-Masry, defeated a visiting Al Ahly side. A majority of the victims in the stadium rampage were Al Ahly fans, with many believing they had been targeted after their role in the revolution had helped topple longstanding President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. "I did do the sign but did not intend any political incitement for any group or any fan," Abdul Zaher said in a statement. "I meant it in mourning for the Egyptians who died in Rabaa (al-Adawiya square), including citizens, soldiers and policemen." Zaher's comments come despite his status as one of the few football stars who participated in the Muslim Brotherhood's sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Zaher is not the first Egyptian sportsman to suffer because of his association with the gesture. Last month, an Egyptian kung fu champion who wore a T-shirt with the Rabaa sign was barred from representing his country and stripped of a medal he had won at a tournament in Russia. Zaher's agent said the controversial celebration had its roots in personal tragedy that stemmed from the August actions, when security forces stormed the pro-Morsy camp a month after the military had ousted the Islamist leader. "What he meant by the sign is that he was mourning one of his friends who died during the events surrounding the clearing of Rabaa al-Adawiya square in August," said Mohammed Sheiha. "Abdul Zaher wrote an apology to the Al Ahly club's board of directors and the Egyptian public for showing the Rabaa sign during the match between Ahly and Orlando Pirates." Zaher's goal in Cairo, which clinched an aggregate 3-1 victory over the South African side as Al Ahly landed a record eighth continental crown, sealed their place in the Club World Cup. Africa will stage the tournament for the first time when Morocco hosts an event that begins on 11 December, with Al Ahly playing Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande three days later. Champions League winners Bayern Munich and South America's Copa Libertadores holders Atletico Mineiro, who boast Ronaldinho in their number, are among those contesting the seven-team event.
As recently as six years ago, it was conventional wisdom among lawyers, legislators and policy advocates that the states had no role in setting immigration policy. Since then, there has been a federalist revolution of historic proportions. One-third of the states now mandate that some employers enroll in the federal employment verification program, E-Verify. Seven states require it of all but the smallest employers. Five have enacted policing laws similar to Arizona's SB 1070 that allow local police to inquire about the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons who they suspect are in the country illegally. No wonder the Supreme Court is weighing in, hearing arguments this week on the Justice Department's challenge to SB 1070. Refereeing turf battles between Washington and the states is one of the court's first responsibilities. But something is troubling. The court is considering and will eventually rule on one very particular, polarizing state stratagem. That doesn't come across as impartial refereeing. Whatever the outcome, it will feel like judges making policy -- either endorsing or outlawing police questions about immigration status. If the justices are going to encourage federalism, I'd like to see them encourage it more evenhandedly, opening the way to a broader array of state initiatives, including those that go beyond enforcement. Those who want Washington to make immigration policy have a hundred years of history and a raft of persuasive arguments on their side. The Constitution reserves some powers for Congress: naturalization and, by extension, determining who and how many immigrants we admit. Federal law carves out other areas, including most worksite enforcement. And sheer practicality argues for one national policy on the border. But after five years of federal paralysis, with Washington still unable to act to fix the immigration system, it's understandable that states have been taking matters into their own hands. The laws have come in waves: One state tries something, others follow. The first waves were all enforcement measures: voters and lawmakers trying anything to get control, first by regulating landlords, then limiting hiring, then using local police and even public school teachers to inquire about people's immigration status. But recently, a handful of states have tried to go beyond enforcement. Utah pioneered the new path. Three-part legislation passed in spring 2011 combined an Arizona-like policing measure with a state-run guest worker program to bring in legal workers from Mexico, plus an initiative to grant work permits to unauthorized immigrants already living and working in Utah. This year, lawmakers in five other states as different as Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Vermont and California floated similar worker authorization bills. Legislators in many states express interest in guest worker programs. It's not just immigrant rights advocates who are driving the measures -- many are backed by surprising coalitions. In some instances, business is engaged. Even in the downturn, farmers, nonfarm seasonal employers and other industries that rely on physical labor need immigrants to do jobs for which there are few willing and able Americans. In some states, the sponsors are pragmatic conservatives. Republican state Sen. Curt Bramble of Utah is as eager as Arizona's enforcement-minded sheriffs to get control of illegal immigration. But Bramble believes it will take a combination of enforcement and realism about the unauthorized population. "Most aren't going home," he says, "no matter what we do. And the states are stuck with the costs. We have to educate, medicate and incarcerate them. But we can't let them work. It's the biggest unfunded mandate in history." What's different in the states is that this kind of pragmatism can break through, and lawmakers aren't afraid to try experiments, even unlikely bipartisan experiments like Utah's worker authorization program. The problem for Utah is that the Obama administration, determined to limit states' rights and keep the lid on state immigration enforcement, hasn't let the state implement any of its initiatives. Unlike states pursuing enforcement alone, states seeking to combine enforcement with other measures can't simply take matters into their own hands. A state-run guest worker program can't bring legal workers across the border without cooperation from federal authorities. And without permission from Washington, a state-run worker authorization initiative would leave employers and employees dangerously vulnerable to federal immigration enforcement. The result is a dramatic asymmetry in the experiments in immigration policy being conducted in the laboratories of democracy. It's no accident that the Supreme Court, which many observers see as inclined to encourage state initiatives, is about to consider the merits of yet another enforcement measure. How do we get off this narrow path? How do we break the logjam where Congress is paralyzed, creative state lawmakers are stymied and the only people implementing new immigration policy are those seeking to use draconian enforcement to drive immigrants out of the United States -- a theory known as attrition through enforcement? Personally, I hope the Supreme Court will strike down the Arizona law and put the responsibility back on Congress' shoulders. But if it doesn't -- if the justices decide to empower the states -- I hope they and the administration will open the door as widely as possible, with the court ruling broadly to free the states, and the administration cooperating with some constructive state experiments. As many state lawmakers are starting to grasp, the best antidote to illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. Let them experiment -- as freely as possible. Over time, their experimentation just may point the way for Congress. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby

well -- classified. Related: What's new about the 747-8? Let's remind ourselves why the world is so fascinated with this flying technological marvel. For more than half a century, passengers aboard the U.S. presidential aircraft have been witness to American history. Consider the fact that all these things happened on an Air Force One: -- President Kennedy's body was flown to Washington for burial. -- Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president. -- LBJ let a reporter interview him in the plane's stateroom, while dressed only in a towel. -- The only woman ever to swear-in a U.S. president did so aboard Air Force One. -- President Richard Nixon became the first American president to visit China, where he historically opened the door to U.S.-Chinese relations. -- Air Force One served as President George W. Bush's command center during the first hours following the 9/11 attacks. One of the main goals for the new plane, the Air Force said, will be affordability. Although the plane is designed to be more fuel efficient than its predecessor a new 747-8 lists for around $368 million. Add all the presidential bells and whistles and the sticker price goes north rather quickly. The 747-8 is made in the U.S., which the Air Forced hinted was a plus. "The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that), when fully missionized, meets the necessary capabilities," Wednesday's statement said. The four-engine Airbus A380 -- the world's largest airliner -- which is made in France, was thought by some to be Boeing's only competition for Air Force One. When will the President get a new jumbo jet? Hard to say. If everything goes smoothly, Boeing likely will work with the Air Force on hammering out a timeframe and production schedule. In December, Boeing had 36 unfilled orders for 24 passenger versions and 12 freighter models. From humble beginnings as a small, less than impressively outfitted plane during the FDR administration, to its current jumbo jet status, Air Force One has become a world-class icon representing power and privilege. Members of Congress, celebrities and advocates clamor for seats on it, to get rare access to the President -- arguably the most powerful person on the planet. The plane's well-known blue and white color scheme was largely created by legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy and approved by JFK himself. Officially, the aircraft is only called Air Force One while a sitting president is aboard. The presidential fleet includes several aircraft, other than the two 747s, that from time to time carry the "Air Force One" call sign. The presidential helicopter is operated by the Marine Corps and is often seen ferrying the President to and from the South Lawn of the White House. It's called "Marine One." On the rare occasion the President travels by Army aircraft, that is known as "Army One." By the same logic, aircraft used to carry the vice president are given the call sign "Air Force Two." Over the years, the various "Air Force Ones" have had their fair share of Hollywood screen roles. For example, the technological wizardry onboard the present 747s got wide play in the 1997 Harrison Ford action movie "Air Force One," in which the President's jet is hijacked by Russian nationalists. However, many of the more outlandish gizmos featured in the film owed more to, shall we say, artistic license than to airborne fact. The plane for example has no escape pod. Nor is it equipped with parachutes -- the massive slipstream created by an aircraft the size of a 747 means they can't be used. Designed to operate as independently as possible from ground services, the aircraft can fly halfway around the world without refueling. They carry their own automated baggage loaders as well as built-in front and aft stairs enabling them to operate self-sufficiently at airports and airfields around the world, minimizing security risks. Capable of in-flight refueling from airborne tankers, manufacturers say the aircraft has "virtually unlimited range" -- its passengers sustained by galleys capable of storing up to 2,000 meals at a time. The entire aircraft is shielded against the effects of electromagnetic pulse -- a wave of energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear device that can disable unprotected electronics. It  features private accommodation, office space and a workout room for the President, first lady and family; as well as accommodation and offices for support staff and security personnel. Also on board is a stateroom and conference rooms that can, should it ever be necessary, be converted into a fully functional airborne medical center. CNN's Joe Havely contributed to this report.
A Jordanian official ordered an investigation Saturday to look into police officers' attacks on pro-reform demonstrators in Amman, state-run media reported. Riot police punched, kicked and beat protesters with sticks Friday on the streets of Amman, according to CNN reporters on the scene. Several journalists were among those caught up in the violence, in some instances attacked by police. Police Capt. Mahmoud El-Khatib initially said that authorities only used "appropriate force" to prevent even worse bloodshed among what he called two groups of protesters -- one backing the government, the other calling for reform. But witnesses said there were no such rival groups, blaming police using batons and other means to beat back protesters. Lt. Gen. Hussein Majali, the head of Jordan's public security department, on Saturday described the incident as a "police attack on a pro-reform march in Amman," according to the Petra news agency. This same report said the demonstration was organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and youth groups, which is distinct from its account the previous day. Majali called for the creation of a panel of "senior officers" to investigate, a probe that began Friday night. This investigation, which will use "video material available to the committee," is expected to be done within 72 hours, followed by possible criminal trials. Already, four policemen have been detained as suspects for their involvement in the violence, according to Petra, which was citing a statement from the Middle Eastern nation's public security department. While there have been demonstrations in Jordan, as elsewhere in the Arab world, they have been largely peaceful and few have called for the ouster of its ruler, King Abdullah II. Still, the violence Friday was at times stark. One man lay on the ground, covered with blood-soaked tissues after a witness said he was hit in the head. Another man had a big gash on his arm. A woman, part of a group of 20 huddled together, said she felt shaky after being knocked in the head. The state-run news report did not offer a casualty count, beyond claiming that 17 police officers were injured in the clashes. There were "light to medium injuries to a number of journalists," Petra reported. Mohammed Hanoun, a photographer, said he was attacked by police -- arguing with an official press liaison, who denied the media was being targeted. "This is the moment I was hit," said Hanoun, showing a picture. "Do you see it? This is the last picture I took; he hit me with the shield." Journalists typically wear orange vests in Jordan so they can be identified from protesters or police. Many media members took off their orange vests in solidarity with attacked journalists on Friday. Salman Al Masaed, who was in the front row of the pro-reform demonstration, said he had no doubt that it was police -- and not rival protesters -- waging the offensive. "We did not see a single person attack us," he said. "The only people that attacked us were the security forces, with their batons."
It's 4 o'clock on a Sunday morning when a trail of figures dressed in white emerges from the deep darkness. Quietly, the summoned crowd makes its way down a cluster of ancient structures as the slow beat from traditional skin drums beckons. It's a common scene here in Lalibela, a small town in northern Ethiopia that's home to 11 spectacular churches carved both inside and out from a single rock some 900 years ago. The chiseled creations have turned this mountain town into a place of pride and pilgrimage for worshipers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, attracting 80,000 to 100,000 visitors every year. "It is one of the very important places for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church people," says local guide Fikru Woldegiorgis, who's lived here most of his life. "There is a belief that Lalibela pilgrims share the same blessing as pilgrims to Jerusalem," he explains. "They have to come at least once in a lifetime." And they come from all over. Even though Lalibela sits in a remote region of Ethiopia, the faithful will walk for days, even weeks, to get here, many of them traversing the rugged mountains barefoot. Amongst them, blind men and women and people with disabilities also join the pilgrimage, making their way along Lalibela's winding, hilly roads to reach the sacred site. "What makes the Lalibela churches important is that they are still in use," says Woldegiorgis. "It's not a museum; it's a living heritage. Every day, every morning, there is a service in all the churches." Brimming with spirituality Ethiopia is home to one of the oldest Christian churches in the world, dating back to the early fourth century. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church used to be a part of Egypt's Coptic Church, but established its own patriarch in 1959. Today, nearly two thirds of the East African country's population is Christian, with most belonging to the Orthodox Church. Read this: Will African coins rewrite Australian history? Nowhere does the spirituality of the church's followers echo louder than in Lalibela. The town is brimming with devotion; throughout the churches' compound, you'll find worshipers leaning against the structures, kissing the age-old rock walls, praying quietly or reading religious texts. "They come early to get the blessing -- because it's such a big deal, every inch of the place is packed," says Aba Gebreyesus, the priest who presides over all the churches in Lalibela. "People are so happy with the blessings they get here, they come here without any prompting and spend their nights and days at the church." Distinctive monuments The medieval structures were commissioned by King Lalibela, of the Zagwe Dynasty, which ruled much of the country back in the 12th century. There are several stories surrounding the creation of the churches, one of which says that humans worked during the day and angels would speed up the building overnight. Some historians say construction was completed at a remarkable pace, taking about 23 years. Watch this: Why do Rastafarians love Ethiopia? Carved out of volcanic tuff rock, the famous churches have been built in a variety of styles. Some of them were chiseled into the face of the rock, where others stand as isolated blocks, like the iconic church of Saint George, constructed in the shape of the cross. A complex and extensive system of drainage ditches, tunnels and subterranean passageways connects the underground structures. Alebachev Retta, an 86-year-old church scholar who has studied in some of Ethiopia's holiest cities, explains what makes these churches so distinctive. "They are different because they were built from the top down," he says. "Everywhere in the world, structures are built from the ground up," he adds. "There is nothing comparable in the world." Living legacy Thanks to their impressive architecture and rich influence on Ethiopian Christianity, the churches have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1978. Five years ago, UNESCO decided to erect protective coverings to shield four of the churches from the elements. The shelters may be unsightly, but experts say they are critical to preserving the integrity of the churches. In recent years, a conscious effort to develop Lalibela's infrastructure has also brought further attention to this remote place, leading to the arrival of even more pilgrims and tourists. Retta says he's seen positive changes in Lalibela over the years. He says he's especially content with how it's become a worldwide tourist destination. "One, because the country's culture should be shown, and secondly, many poor people in the area are being helped," he says. "Everyone is making a living through the tourism business. It's great; without the tourists, there is no salary for anyone. If the tourists stopped, everything will stop." But that doesn't seem likely, as visitors keep on coming to Lalibela's churches. And although the sacred sites provide a solid foundation for the faithful, it's the followers themselves that ultimately breathe life into these ancient rock walls.
"This is Norway checker," echoed the voice through the scrambler. "I have a good stop for you in Stavanger." Nobody on the outside world could have known what she meant. But inside Bletchley Park, a World War II code-breaking enclave in the English countryside of Buckinghamshire, 18-year-old Ruth Bourne had discovered a vital piece of intelligence. Working alongside thousands of other women to decipher encoded German signals sent between Nazi generals, Bourne's discovery meant passing on the information to her superiors to assess whether this was another piece of the decryption puzzle. Read more: Code-breaking Enigma machine goes under the hammer With every room named after a country that had been toppled by the Nazis, and each machine christened as one of its towns, Bletchley Park's simple yet effective checking system proved crucial in the defeat of Hitler's regime. A culture of secrecy Far from being a group of experienced decoders, however, the estate's recruits mainly consisted of young teenage military personnel, a smattering of crossword whizzes who had been able to complete The Daily Telegraph's puzzle in less than 12 minutes, and numerous 18-year-old girls plucked from their quiet home towns. "It was the middle of the war when I received a call saying I was to go into war work to support Britain's efforts from home," explains 88-year-old Margaret Bullen, a machine wire operator who served from 1942 until the end of the war. "A letter from the Foreign Office then arrived saying I had an interview -- but I had no idea what it was for, and two weeks later, I was told I'd be off to Bletchley." Read more: Enigma machine sells for world record price "Before starting work we were told to sign the Official Secrets Act, which was a rather frightening experience for someone as young and naive as I was," says 90-year-old Becky Webb, who joined the war effort at age 18 in 1941. "I had no idea how I'd comply with it!" But compliance was the only option, making these three young women -- Webb, Bullen and Bourne -- fierce guards of the country's anonymous decoding history for several decades. Indeed, it wasn't until some thirty years later that Bletchley's long maintained shroud of secrecy began to lift, after the publication of "The Ultra Secret" -- a tell all book from former RAF officer Frederick W. Winterbotham, who later became an Ultra supervisor. The 1974 expose revealed how Ultra intelligence had been used to intercept communication behind enemy lines and disseminate vital information to Britain and its allies. Though Winterbotham was accused of embellishing and aggrandizing his role in the tale, without his account, the real story of what went on inside the UK's code-breaking operation may never have been known. Read more: 70-year-old coded war message found attached to pigeon "It sounds strange that we knew so little about what was going on, but that was how it was," reflects Bullen. "I was sent to live with a couple who were ordered to take me in because of the war. They never once asked me what I was doing there--nobody did--not even the local village workers who'd serve us coffee at the cafÃ© on our lunch break, in spite of the fact a group of 18-year-olds had suddenly arrived in this little hamlet," she explains. "I only heard the name Colossus--the machine I was working on--some three decades after the war ended, and it wasn't until I later visited Bletchley Park that I said: 'this is where I worked, this is what I did!'" While Winterbotham's revelations sent shock waves through the secretive decryption community, lifting the lid on what really happened inside the park ensued slowly and sporadically, with the bulk of the information being released in the early 2000s. "I'm delighted that we can discuss our time there now that everything has come out, and I give talks on the subject whenever I'm asked," enthuses Webb. "I've given 97 to date!" Silent heroines For many of the young women at Bletchley, though, the removal of the clandestine veil came too late, with the majority of workers' parents having passed away before the decryption effort became public knowledge. Bourne, an 18-year-old naval recruit who was sent to one of the park's expansion locations in Eastcote -- on the outskirts of London -- was one of many who was never able to tell her loved ones about her contribution to the war. "You led two lives there," she recalls. "One life was in A Block, where you ate in the canteen, and talked about boyfriends, and getting trains to London, and where to find black nylon stockings." "B Block was where we worked, surrounded by high walls, barbed wire and two naval marines guarding the place. If you could make your voice heard over the noise of 12 Turing Bombe machines, that was the only time you would speak about work -- but you never would," she explains. "I never knew what any of my coworkers were doing, and vice versa, and my parents never knew a thing of it." After the Nazi regime fell in 1945, many of Bletchley's women returned home, while others stayed involved with the military's work. Bourne was given work as a wire destroyer: desoldering the many cables that had been painstakingly connected during intelligence operations throughout the war, while Webb was sent to the Pentagon to paraphrase translated Japanese messages for transmission to officials. "Upon leaving Bletchley, we really had no skills whatsoever," remembers Bourne. "Apart from how to keep a secret!" And that secret was very nearly never told, especially after the original estate was due to be knocked down some 23 years ago, with houses and a supermarket planned to be built in its place. Preserving Bletchley It was in May of 1991that Bletchley's fortunes changed, after a small local committee gathered a group of veterans at the park to say a final farewell to the historic location. But the group became determined to turn it into a heritage site after hearing the astounding stories of so many code-breakers, engineers and members of the Women's Royal Naval Service (WREN) who worked at the park during the war. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed the following year, and from then on, regular reunions and exhibitions at the estate have enabled its former workers and inhabitants to share stories that were on the precipice of being lost forever. Winterbotham's book might have been the first time that story of the World War II code-breakers entered the realm of popular culture, but it certainly wasn't the last, with TV drama "The Bletchley Circle" proving popular in both the UK and United States earlier this year. With a second series on its way, and exhibitions at the Trust attracting visitors from around the globe, the world's fascination with the once elusive Bletchley Park shows no sign of slowing. The culture of secrecy that once threatened Bletchley from being all but erased from the history books has well and truly ended. The National Museum Of Computing at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, UK unveils its "Women in computing" exhibit.
Moshe Goldstein, Avrohom Goldstein and Simcha Bulmash -- had bail set at $500,000, said Matthew Riley, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of New Jersey. Jay Goldstein's attorney, Aidan P. O'Connor, told CNN on Thursday he hoped his client would be able to leave jail and reunite with his family. Goldstein, Rabbi Mendel Epstein and Rabbi Martin Wolmark, along with seven other defendants, are accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars to orchestrate the kidnappings of Jewish husbands to persuade them to grant divorces to their wives, according to a criminal complaint. Goldstein is a sofer, a Jewish scribe who transcribes the Torah and writes other religious documents, including divorce papers, according to his attorney. On Wednesday, Arpert set bail between $500,000 and $1 million for the two rabbis, along with four other defendants: Ariel Potash, Binyamin Stimler, David Hellman and Sholom Shuchat. Arpert also ordered home arrest -- with exceptions to leave for medical reasons, attorney meetings and religious purposes -- for all six, according to court documents. Jay Goldstein, the rabbis and the other men were arrested after an FBI undercover investigation that led to a raid on October 9, according to the criminal complaint. In one conversation with undercover FBI agents, the complaint alleges that Epstein talked about forcing the divorces with the help of hired "tough guys," who he said used plastic bags to cover the husbands' heads, and electric cattle prods and karate to assault them. "I guarantee you that if you're in the van, you'd give a 'get' to your wife. You probably love your wife, but you'd give a 'get' when they finish with you," Epstein told the undercover FBI agents. A "get" is a document that Jewish law requires a husband to present to his wife to be issued a divorce, the complaint says. Without it, a woman is considered an "agunah," a chained woman bound to a man no matter how over their marriage might be. The implications of not having a get are serious in the Orthodox Jewish world. For Jews of other denominations, who interpret Jewish law differently, the requirement of a get is less stringent or dismissed altogether. An Orthodox Jewish woman who does not receive a get, however, runs the risk of being shunned in her community and labeled an adulteress if she dares move on. And any future children she has are considered bastards permitted to marry only other bastards. The complaint says that Epstein told the undercover FBI agents that his organization had kidnapped a husband every 12 to 18 months. The complaint also says that Wolmark told the agents, "You need special rabbis who are going to take this thing and see it through to the end." "I can say that we are pleased the court accepted our bail proposal. I anticipate Rabbi Wolmark will be released shortly," said Marc Agnifilo, Wolmark's attorney. "The rabbi is a highly respected Gittin scholar, and he steadfastly denies the allegations that he ordered violence," said Agnifilo. Wolmark, Esptein and Potash's attorneys all told CNN that they are confident their clients will have their bail processed and be out on a house arrest by the end of this week. CNN's calls to the other defendant's attorneys were not answered. All 10 defendants pleaded not guilty last week. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
The Cold War aerial games of chicken portrayed in the movie "Top Gun" are happening in real life again nearly 30 years later. A U.S. Air Force spy plane evaded an encounter with the Russian military on July 18, just a day after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a suspected surface-to-air missile that Ukraine and the West allege was fired by pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine. The RC-135 Rivet Joint fled into nearby Swedish airspace without that country's permission, a U.S. military official told CNN. The airplane may have gone through other countries' airspace as well, though it's not clear if it had permission to do so. The U.S. plane had been flying in international airspace, conducting an electronic eavesdropping mission on the Russian military, when the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land-based radar. The Russians then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the aircraft, the U.S. official said Saturday. The spy plane crew felt so concerned about the radar tracking that it wanted to get out of the area as quickly as possible, the official said. The quickest route away from the Russians took them into Swedish airspace. The U.S. official acknowledged that was done without Swedish military approval. As a result of this incident, the United States is discussing the matter with Sweden and letting officials know there may be further occurrences where American jets have to divert so quickly they may not be able to wait for permission. "We acknowledge a U.S. aircraft veered into Swedish airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with Swedish authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they arise," the U.S. State Department said. The incident was first reported by the Swedish news agency Svenska Dagbladet. Russian officials did not provide any immediate reaction about the encounter. This was at least the second potentially-dangerous encounter between a U.S. plane and Russia over the past few months. On April 23, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan, a Defense Department official said. Russian fighter jet nearly collided with U.S. military plane in April Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska. But the official said the land radar activity by the Russians in this instance was unusual. The ongoing civil unrest in Ukraine and the downing of MH 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, which killed all 298 people aboard, have heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow.  Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was brought down by a suspected missile. Pro-Russia rebels have denied allegations from Ukraine and the West that they shot down the Malaysian airliner, or that Russia supplied equipment used to shoot it down.
Christopher Wolfe has a Tough As Nails, I Love America attitude. His pride swells along with his tattooed biceps. He's a dying breed, a blue-collar American working on a product as American as apple pie. Blue jeans. "This is our lifeline," Wolfe says. Those jeans you squeezed into this morning? It's likely they began right here at Mount Vernon Mills, one of the last functioning cotton mills in America and the nation's No. 1 producer of denim. In a tiny enclave of northwest Georgia, Wolfe and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans. Most U.S. mills shut down years ago, unable to compete with cheap overseas labor. And in another sign of the global economy, the fabric woven here is rarely sent to American plants to be turned into jeans. Instead, the fabric is shipped mostly to factories in Mexico. The jeans then carry labels that read "Made in Mexico of U.S. fabric." Blame NAFTA. Blame outsourcing. Blame corporate greed for the selling out of America's manufacturing soul. "I'd rather see people over here work, instead of struggling -- instead of giving somebody in another country a chance to make money that [Americans] should be making," says Wolfe, 31. He's got a scar across his forehead, a shaved head and goatee. Like a pair of well-worn blue jeans, he's rough and tough. Some workers here are second- and third-generation employees, following in the footsteps of their fathers, mothers and grandparents. Wolfe's dad and brother work at the mill. You can see the pride in their faces: Made in U.S.A., baby. "We contribute a lot to America," Wolfe says with a smile. He's a father of four young daughters. He makes about $9 an hour. He toils for them, for his little girls, so they can have a better a life. "This mill here," he says, "it feeds my family." It has been in existence since 1845, when slaves handpicked cotton in the South. Back then, mill workers spun the cotton into fabric and shipped it to factories in the North. It's said Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman came through Trion, Georgia, during the Civil War and decided not to burn the factory down. The reason remains town lore. Some speculate the Union general might've been treated to the charms of Southern hospitality at the local hotel (wink, wink). What's a good Southern tale without -- dare we say it? -- some yarnspinning. "Boss Man" who fights for workers Inside, you can't help but marvel at the scene around you. Hundreds of spools of thread churn all at once, with computer-like precision. There's a million-square-feet of manufacturing space, much of it Canadian rock maple hardwood floors. It's clean with a brilliant shine. Thread shoots every which way, as if Spider-Man came through. Go from cotton field to denim The sweet, distinct smell of cotton permeates the mill -- like that of nature in a hardwood forest, with the faint hint of a wet Labrador retriever. When you walk through with general manager Don Henderson, the workers pause. They glance at "Boss Man". Many stroll over to shake his hand. How you doing? Everything, OK? Henderson is one reason this place is still in business, on American soil. He has an aww-shucks attitude. He'll tell you it's those men and women out there on the floor that keep it going. He's got pride in the plant, in his workers and in his family. His father worked for 39 years in the spinning department. His brother retired from the plant after 42 years, having started when he was 16 and eventually making his way into management. "If I had the ultimate say-so, we would be right here for the next 100 years," says Henderson, 64, who has worked in the plant for 40 years. While the nation's manufacturing base has shrunk, Mount Vernon Mills is a rare exception. The tiny town of Trion -- pronounced Try-On, as in "our residents always 'try on,'" 78-year-old Mayor Benny Perry says -- has a staggeringly large annual budget for such a small town. Its $12 million, mostly from taxes the mill pays, provides a state-of-the-art public school, park space and athletic fields. If the mill shuttered, "it would destroy the town," Perry says. In its heydey, the mill had 5,000 workers in the 1940s and 1950s. The company owned everything in town back then, from the tiny mill houses that surround the plant to the town hospital where Henderson and many of his co-workers were born. As a result, Trion doesn't have a quaint town square. The mill is the centerpiece. About two years ago, when the nation's recession hit hard, the plant had to layoff about 200 workers. "It was awful," Henderson says. To save as many jobs as possible and to maximize efficiency, the plant switched to two, 12-hour shifts. That's down from three shifts, five days a week. The denim for jeans goes to companies as wide-ranging as Wal-Mart to JCPenney to Dickies to Polo and other high-priced brands. Henderson's most proud of the mill's ties to cowboys. "We make the Wrangler rodeo cowboy jeans that all the rodeo guys still wear," he says. "We make the fabric right here and have been for -- gosh -- 30 years." Henderson holds up one roll of distressed fabric that's nearly ready to be shipped. It's denim that once was used for lower-end clothing. But yuppies like the look. Henderson chuckles and shakes his head. Martha Teague is 63 and has worked in the mill for the past 35 years. She says other company towns had bosses that sold them out, that cared more about the dollar than its people. "It just gives me a good feeling to be a part of that family of Mount Vernon Mills," says Teague, who has a son working at the plant. "It has educated my children and gives us a house and everything we have really." Wolfe wheels 13,000 yards of yarn into the dimly lit "ballroom." It's placed among a heap of others. "We're lucky to have what we got. Other small towns, they don't have that." He turns and walks away in the orange glow of the ballroom. You want to know a secret? A $12 pair of jeans often comes from the same roll of denim as a $150 designer pair.
Juventus took on Torino in the Turin derby last weekend, and in honor of that we have scoured the world to bring you 10 other local derbies that stir the passions of those involved. At the River Plate and Boca Juniors matches, the atmosphere can swell to boiling point. Don't agree? Think we've left out a more hotly contested derby? Tell us about one you think should make the top 10 in our Sound Off box, below. 1) CELTIC v RANGERS -- Glasgow, Scotland These two are the bitterest of bitter rivals. Not only are they divided by football, but by religion as well, with Rangers taking their support from the Protestant community and Celtic the Catholic community. The hostility has become so intense that both clubs have asked their fans to stop singing the sectarian songs that had become commonplace on match days. To add fuel to the fire, they are consistently the only two teams who challenge for the Scottish title, with the make-up of the Premier League ensuring they face each other four times in a season, not including cups. Despite both clubs attracting some top foreign stars, the helter-skelter nature of the fixture has not been diluted over time, as confirmed by the number of dismissals over the years. 2) ROMA v LAZIO -- Rome, Italy Undoubtedly the fiercest derby match in Italy, these two rivals really hate each other. Violence in and around the Olympic Stadium between the sets of supporters, and the police, has become an all-too-common occurrence in recent seasons. Both teams hate the perceived arrogance from the Northern cities (Milan, Turin) -- but they loathe each other more. Roma take their support from a traditional working-class fan base, while Lazio's support tends to come from the wealthier districts. The historical political differences between the fans is another reason for this rivalry. Lazio's supporters, in general, followed right-wing ideals while the Roma fans leaned more to the left. 3) BOCA JUNIORS v RIVER PLATE -- Buenos Aires, Argentina Although by no means the most "local" derby in South America (the clubs are about 7km apart), it is undeniably the most intense. The rivalry, hatred and violence involved are based on social class and money. Both clubs were founded in the poor district of Buenos Aires called La Boca, but River Plate moved to a wealthier area called Nunez in the 1930s, heightening the animosity between the clubs. Boca Juniors' stadium is known as "La Bombonera" (The Box of Chocolates) because of its layout. The steep stands and the lack of a running track makes for a particularly intimidating atmosphere. 4) AL AHLY v ZAMALEK -- Cairo, Egypt Arguably Africa's most passionate derby, this match brings together two of the continent's most successful clubs. Their rivalry is so strong that foreign referees are always brought in for the derby games and, following a number of violent incidents, matches between the two have been moved to the 75,000 capacity Cairo International Stadium. On the pitch, Al Ahly currently have the upper hand, winning the last four league titles. 5) GALATASARAY v FENERBAHCE -- Istanbul, Turkey The Bosphorus separates the city of Istanbul into a European side and an Asian side. Galatasaray, on the European side, have traditionally been the wealthier of the two clubs, while Fenerbahce, on the Asian side, have a largely working-class following. However, in recent years, Fenerbahce have attracted a number of wealthy fans who have pumped money into the club, thus unbalancing the equilibrium. Nowadays, there is nothing to choose between them on and off the pitch. The last five league titles have alternated between the two clubs and both clubs have won 17 Turkish championships. 6) OLYMPIAKOS v PANATHINAIKOS -- Athens, Greece This is the derby between the two giants of Greek football, although the rivalry between the two also exists in basketball, Greece's national sport. In the past, Olympiakos, from the port area of Piraeus, used to represent the working class, while Panathinaikos represented the upper-class suburbs of Athens. Nowadays, the situation has evened out. However, on the pitch, Olympiakos are the dominant club, having won 11 of the last 12 league titles, including the last four in a row. 7) RED STAR BELGRADE v PARTIZAN BELGRADE -- Belgrade, Serbia This is a relatively new fixture: both clubs were founded in 1945, but what they lack in age, they make up for in passion. Partizan was founded as the football section of the central club of the former Yugoslavian Army, while Red Star was founded as the civilians' club. Red Star, or Crvena Zvezda as they are now known, have traditionally been the more successful, achieving the ultimate of winning the European Cup in 1991. 8) WYDAD v RAJA -- Casablanca, Morocco These two are the biggest clubs in Morocco and violence between the fans often mars these fixtures. Wydad used to dominate honors, but in recent seasons Raja have enjoyed more success. N.B. Raja means "hope" and Wydad means "love," although there is certainly no love between the rivals when they face each other! 9) PALMEIRAS v CORINTHIANS -- Sao Paulo, Brazil Another derby that has been going for nearly 100 years. Corinthians used to be the only club in the city, but a group of Italian members broke away to form Palmeiras, earning the nickname of the "betrayers" by Corinthians fans. Morumbi is the biggest stadium in Sao Paulo and all the derbies are played there, although the Pacaembu stadium, which hosts many Corinthians matches, is also used for the occasion. 10) PENAROL v NACIONAL -- Montevideo, Uruguay One of the oldest derby matches in the world, with both clubs being formed in the 1890s. The two most honored clubs in Uruguay, they share a remarkable 85 Uruguayan league titles and eight Copa Libertadores championships between them. The derby is always played in the Centenario Stadium, with a capacity of almost 74,000, although Nacional also have their own ground in a different neighborhood of the city. Who are your fiercest rivals? Do fiery derbies hurt or hinder football? What is your favorite local match? Tell us your opinions in the Sound Off box below.
In the last few weeks, the media has been ablaze with news of the government shutdown, the debt limit and health care reform. Missing from most public debate, however, is the cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that will take place on November 1 and will affect every one of the more than 47 million Americans who depend on the program to help meet their basic nutritional needs. When the changes are implemented, everyone enrolled in the SNAP program will see their benefits cut. For example, a family of four that qualifies for the maximum monthly benefit will lose $36 a month -- that's a 5% reduction. While this may not seem like a lot, I speak from experience when I say $36 provides much more than you might think. This past September, I participated in the SNAP challenge. For a week, I stuck to a budget of about $1.50 per meal, the average SNAP benefit for one person. It was a tough week. I found myself drained and constantly thinking of food. When the SNAP cuts take effect next week, benefits will average about $1.40 per meal. I can't imagine the strain this will place on struggling families who are counting every penny and trying to stretch their benefits. Eatocracy: The food stamp challenge Most families do not have enough to make it through the month already -- 90% of SNAP benefits are redeemed by the third week of the month and 58% of food bank clients currently receiving SNAP turn to food banks for help at least six months out of the year. The upcoming cuts will result in an increased need for food assistance at food pantries and soup kitchens across the nation when many are already stretched meeting sustained high need in the wake of the recession. At Feeding America, we're doing everything we can to prepare our network of food banks for the increased demand, but charity alone cannot make up for the impending $5 billion loss in SNAP funding. The reduced funding will result in the loss of nearly 1.9 billion meals in the next year. That's more than half of Feeding America's total projected output for 2014. The cuts this week are significant and will put a strain on millions of families struggling with food insecurity, hitting them right before the holiday season. Adding to this is the fact that Congress is considering much deeper cuts to SNAP benefits and eligibility restrictions that will affect millions of low-income people as part of the farm bill. In September, the House passed legislation cutting $40 billion in SNAP over the next 10 years, according to a Feeding America analysis. Together with this week's cuts, the pending legislation will result in a loss of nearly 3.4 billion meals for low-income Americans in 2014 alone, according to a Feeding America analysis. These are meals our most vulnerable citizens cannot afford to lose, and food banks and other charities simply cannot fill that gap. While we cannot stop this week's SNAP cuts, we can prevent further cuts from taking place. Call your member of Congress and tell them not to cut SNAP. Helping our neighbors in need is a fundamental American value, and fighting hunger is a public-private partnership. We need a strong charitable system and a strong federal anti-hunger safety net. Working together, individuals, charities, business and government can solve hunger. Do your part to make sure no one in America goes hungry.

"It was killing people, and I wanted to do something about it." Bambi Gaddist's nonprofit has provided free HIV tests to more than 8,600 people since 2000. That realization about the AIDS crisis propelled Bambi Gaddist into activism in South Carolina more than 20 years ago, and she's been relentless in her fight to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS there ever since. One of the most effective tools in her arsenal? A large white RV. With "GET TESTED" written in bold letters on its side, the camper van is the mobile unit of the South Carolina HIV/AIDS Council, a nonprofit that Gaddist helped start and has headed since 1995. The only unit of its kind in South Carolina, the van brings confidential HIV testing and information to communities across the state. Since 2000, Gaddist's organization has provided HIV tests to more than 8,600 people, free of charge. Gaddist says the face of AIDS has changed since the mid-1980s, when she helped run one of the first grass-roots AIDS awareness campaigns in Columbia, South Carolina, while pursuing her doctorate in public health. "In the '80s, HIV was seen as a gay, white male disease," Gaddist said. "Here in South Carolina, it became an African-American disease." In 2006, African-Americans accounted for 76 percent of the new AIDS cases diagnosed in South Carolina, and the state ranked ninth in the nation for those living with the disease, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. iReport.com: Share stories of being black in America Statistics like these are what drives Gaddist and her staff. The mobile unit hits the road at least two to three times a week, and Gaddist says it goes just about anywhere -- gay and straight nightclubs, housing projects, health fairs or churches. "We refuse to be quiet. That's what's going to save the lives of our children: talking about it and not hiding it," Gaddist said. At outreach events, staffers distribute free condoms and information while trying to recruit people to be tested. Eight to 15 people usually take the 10-minute test at every event. Someday, Gaddist hopes, HIV tests will be as common as breast cancer exams or skin cancer screenings.  Watch Gaddist and her team in action outside a nightclub » "We're trying to normalize this," Gaddist said. "[We want] anyone, regardless of who they are, to say, 'I need to know my status.' " Gaddist believes that the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS has contributed to people's ignorance about the virus and to its alarming spread throughout the state. "After 27 years of AIDS, we are still combating a mentality of fear and shame," she said. In response, Gaddist has recruited powerful allies to her cause: South Carolina's churches. Since 2006, Gaddist's group has run a program that educates local pastors about the disease and teaches them how to do outreach in their communities. Gaddist has gotten 30 churches on board. She believes that this isn't just spreading much-needed awareness; it's helping reshape public attitudes.  Watch Gaddist describe how churches have gotten involved with her cause » "People still believe that you get [HIV/AIDS] from touching someone, from hugging someone," Gaddist said. "The first arm of defense against this disease is to educate them." In the past, Gaddist says, some churches helped perpetuate the stigma about the disease. "[But] now more than ever before, the church holds a solution to the HIV/AIDS epidemic," she said. Gaddist has helped her organization grow from a two-person operation to a 23-member staff. In addition to testing and counseling, the South Carolina HIV/AIDS Council provides case management for people living with HIV and runs several programs targeting at-risk populations. Still, for all she's done, Gaddist can't imagine a time when she'll ever stop doing this work.  Watch Gaddist explain how the mobile outreach unit works with the community » "I joke about being a 70-year-old woman giving out condoms," she said. Knowing how many people are at risk is what keeps Gaddist motivated. "When it's my time, I want my obituary to say that I have made a difference for someone and that I saved somebody's life."
A morning thunderstorm has left the waste ground outside Melilla's compound for migrants and refugees slick with orange mud. Hanging around under overcast skies, a knot of men -- unshaven and dressed in a motley collection of T-shirts -- watch a convoy of Spanish military vehicles rumble by. They have reached this tiny Spanish enclave in North Africa overland -- from Mali, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Some just want a better life in Europe; others are fleeing war. Some have clambered over the three 20-foot (6-meter) fences topped with razor-wire; others have bought forged Moroccan passports to take advantage of Moroccans' eligibility to enter Melilla as day-laborers or to trade. But the Spanish authorities fear that among this tide of the helpless may be some intent on bringing jihad to Europe, using the same routes used by people-smugglers across North Africa. The heavy police presence in Melilla -- the military helicopters, armored vehicles and patrol boats -- are part of their response. So are regular police raids on the poor, crowded neighborhood of Cañada, which sits on a hill overlooking the city center, with its elegant art-deco and modernist buildings, its elegant central park along the Avenida de la Democracia and sweep of sandy beaches. 'Not welcome" Foreigners, and especially journalists, are not welcome in Cañada, where at least one wall bears graffiti in support of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and others urge reclaiming everywhere from Sudan to Iraq as Islamist states. The imam of a mosque in Cañada is not available to talk. We are variously told he is sick or fasting, and are warned not to film in Cañada's precipitous alleys. The tension is greater than usual following a joint operation by Spanish and Moroccan security agencies last week. Eight men were arrested in the neighboring Moroccan town of Nador. The alleged ringleader of a cell said to have been recruiting would-be jihadists for Iraq and Syria was detained in Cañada. Mohamed Said Mohamed was arrested at his home, within a few hundred yards of the fence that separates Melilla from Morocco. The operation to arrest Mohammed was not without incident. A crowd gathered and threw stones at police in riot gear. At one point, witnesses said, police fired in the air as they tried to extricate Mohamed. Everything you need to know about ISIS Spanish police would also like to arrest his brother, Said Mohamed Zakarias, a former Spanish soldier trained in using explosives. After leaving the army in 2010, Zakarias headed south to Mali, where he joined the jihadist group MUJAO, an offshoot of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In early 2012, MUJAO and other groups occupied nearly half of Mali, before French intervention drove them back into pockets of the Sahara. Spanish officials believe Zakarias moved onto Syria, and from there was in touch with his brother about recruiting young men from Morocco to join ISIS. The Moroccan government estimates some 2,000 Moroccans have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria, just as hundreds joined the insurgency in Iraq between 2005 and 2009. Mohamed was swiftly flown to Madrid to face a judge, Javier Bermudes. Denying him bail, Bermudes said Moroccan authorities determined that two men from the cell, had gone to an area of Syria and Iraq controlled by ISIS in July. Bermudes also expressed a fear widely held among Spanish officials, saying in his ruling that "the threat posed by Spaniards or foreigners linked to Spain joining ISIS, or their hypothetical return to our country, is manifestly clear." This year, Spanish security forces have arrested 44 people - some in Melilla, some in Spain's other North African enclave of Ceuta, some on the mainland. According to the police, members of a Melilla group rounded up in May had dispatched 26 men — 24 Moroccans and two Spanish citizens — since 2012 to join Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and MUJAO. The migrants' center in Melilla is overcrowded, and according to some subsisting there, increasingly unhygienic. Designed to accommodate some 400 people, CETI holds more than 2,000. The Madrid government's representative in Melilla, Abdelmalik El Barkani. told CNN Tuesday that the conditions at the CETI were not ideal, but the care of migrants was adequate. "Even though there are many more over the capacity, they have had all necessities covered, and they have been able to eat," he said. "I believe that there they are much better than before they arrived in Melilla," El Barkani said. Other illegal migrants live on Melilla's streets. It seems a dead-end to many who have risked their lives to gain a toe-hold in Europe. 'Humiliated and abandoned' Some of the men loitering outside were from Kobani, the Kurdish town on the Syria-Turkey border now under an intense assault from ISIS. Thirty-four-year old Khalid Barazy has been in Melilla more than a month. "The suffering that we've been living, it's impossible for another human to comprehend. For the last two days it's been raining and we've been sleeping under it," he said. "We escaped death and now we're imprisoned here. Humiliated and abandoned. An entire people is being slaughtered. We escaped death and no one will grant us refuge." At once angry and despondent, Barazy added: "My family are scattered between Turkey and Syria. Some are fighting ISIS, some have fled, some died." Barazy said that he and others from Kobani had first fled to Turkey but even there felt ISIS' presence. And so they had embarked on the long journey west. A few of the lucky ones had been able to fly to Algiers and travel overland into Morocco. Others had crossed one conflict zone after another, through Egypt, Libya and Algeria in a journey taking months. Another of the group, Mahmoud Bozan, said he had been smuggled across the border into Morocco and then into Melilla. He was clearly at his wits' end. "It cost us catastrophic sums. Some people sold their houses, their furniture to get here. And look where we've ended up? I wish we'd stayed in Syria to kill and be killed. It would be better than the camp here." Their situation is full of ironies. As Barazy and others languish in Melilla, some from the Spanish territory and the Moroccan towns around it yearn to travel in the opposite direction, to join the war they have fled. They may use the same people-traffickers to help them do so. And according to Moroccan officials jihadist cells often share in those smuggling revenues. Barazy and the hundreds like him trapped in Melilla may gaze wistfully at the ferries leaving for the Spanish mainland while their asylum requests go unanswered or unresolved. What Spain fears is that others in Melilla, or planning to come here, see those ships as a passage to bring terror to Europe.
but only agreed to the conditions if criminal actions against Havelange and Teixeira were dropped. Havelange played a key role in bringing the 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro when the South American city was awarded the Games in 2009. He became an IOC member in 1963 and was FIFA president between 1974 and 1998 until Blatter, his longtime secretary general, took charge. Havelange spent two months in hospital earlier this year with a heart problem and infected ankle, but he once famously invited IOC members to his 100th birthday party on Copacabana beach in 2016 should Rio get the Games.
As a male model, Andrej Pejic blazed trails with an androgynous look that saw him walking the runway in women's fashion shows. Now Pejic is Andreja. "I always dreamt of being a girl," Pejic revealed to People magazine about her recent gender reassignment surgery. "One of my earliest memories is spinning around in my mom's skirt trying to look like a ballerina." Andrej Pejic: High fashion, minus the labels The Serbian-born model said that growing up she was "hiding who I was." At 13, she told People, "I went into the library and typed 'sex change' into Google and my life changed." The aspiring actress has appeared in a David Bowie video short and has snagged a small part in Sofia Coppola's upcoming film, "The Little Mermaid," according to the Internet Movie Database. Pejic is taking a cue from another transgendered celeb, "Orange Is the New Black" star Laverne Cox, opting not to share the details of her surgery. "What's in between anyone's legs is not who they are," she said. In the spotlight: Carmen Carrera The model said she is happy and settling into her life months after her surgery. She is speaking out, she said, because she feels a sense of social responsibility. She now feels "100 percent," she tells People. "I was proud of my gender nonconforming career," Pejic says to the magazine. "But my biggest dream was to be comfortable in my own body. I have to be true to myself and the career is just going to have to fit around that."
Former vice president Dick Cheney told a special prosecutor in 2004 that he had no idea who leaked the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame, according to newly released FBI documents. Cheney was questioned as part of an investigation on how journalists came to know the identity of Plame, the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was a critic of the Iraq war. In the interview, Cheney responded to many questions with "I do not recall." However, he took a few stabs at the CIA in its handling of White House allegations that Iraq was attempting to purchase uranium from Niger to manufacture nuclear weapons. Wilson was dispatched to Niger on a CIA assignment to explore the charges and later said that the Bush administration was twisting facts to support an invasion of Iraq. He implied in a newspaper article that his trip was at the behest of the vice president. Cheney's reaction to the article was that it was "amateur hour" at the CIA, according to the FBI documents, released after the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, a watchdog group in Washington, sued under the Freedom of Information Act. The 28-page summary of the Cheney interview was made public more than five years after it took place. Cheney, his chief of staff, Scooter Libby, and presidential adviser Karl Rove, were named in a 2006 federal civil lawsuit by Plame and Wilson. Plame contended she was the victim of intentional and malicious exposure and that both she and Wilson suffered a violation of rights. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2007. Only Libby was tried and convicted of perjury, obstruction and lying to the FBI about the Plame leak. President George W. Bush later commuted his sentence. Cheney told the FBI he did not recall discussing Plame with Libby prior to her name being published in a column by Robert Novak in July 2003, and said he had no knowledge of Libby's meeting with New York Times reporter Judith Miller a week before Plame was identified. In closing arguments at Libby's trial, special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald said "a cloud over the vice-president" persisted. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, said: "Mr. Cheney's near total amnesia regarding his role in this monumental Washington scandal -- resulting in the conviction of his top aide -- shows why."
Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday addressed issues ranging from the sex abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church to the easy availability of pornography to the "alarming decrease" in Catholic marriages in the United States. The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Roman Catholic church in North America. Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a "deep shame" and called it "gravely immoral behavior." "Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations," he told the bishops. Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled, the pope admitted.  Watch the pope address the issue » "It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm," he said. The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids. "What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today?" he asked. Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a "moral renewal." Earlier Wednesday, President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. In remarks greeting the pope to the White House, Bush called the United States "a nation of prayer." Bush was interrupted by applause as he said, "In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed." Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States. "From the dawn of the republic, America's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator," he said.  Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip » Earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as "The Star-Spangled Banner." A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes, including "Yankee Doodle," and soprano Kathleen Battle sang "The Lord's Prayer." The day, with perfect spring weather, was also the pontiff's 81st birthday.  After the ceremony concluded, the crowd, led by Battle, serenaded Benedict with "Happy Birthday" as he smiled from a White House balcony.  Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he's like » Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy, ecumenical representatives, Catholic schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus. Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called "one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House." Following the ceremony, Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive "popemobile." His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy, where the pope is staying. Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past. A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests. The pontiff was greeted by Bush, the first lady and their daughter Jenna, each of whom shook his hand. It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews. It marks Benedict's first visit to the United States as pope.   Watch how the pope's visit could affect the presidential campaign » Security will be tight during the six-day visit, with 27 state, local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders, celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile. Benedict faces no specific threats, according to the FBI, but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff. The centerpiece of the trip's Washington leg will be Thursday's Mass at Nationals Park, a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope. Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering, and nearby roads and bridges will be closed. Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium, and a 1½-mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly, linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium.  Where will the pope be? » One of the stated goals of the pope's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members. Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II, Benedict is likely to also address the church's relationship with other faiths, the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, said John Allen, a CNN Vatican analyst.

The only bears known to inhabit New York's Central Park are at its zoo -- so how did a dead bear cub end up under a bush? Neither police nor park officials had an answer for that late Monday, hours after a morning dog walker discovered the carcass of a 3-foot-tall bear cub. The person alerted a Central Park Conservancy worker who then called the police, according to Central Park Conservancy spokeswoman Elizabeth Kaledin. She added that the bear was not from the park's zoo, but "any time wildlife is hurt or injured we are upset and deeply alarmed." The cub was found under a bush near West 69th Street and West Drive in the park, and appeared to show signs of trauma with an injury to its side and possible lacerations, police said. It was not immediately clear whether the bear wandered into the park or if its body was dumped there, an NYPD spokeswoman said. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's animal cruelty squad, the spokeswoman added. The carcass was taken to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany for a necropsy, according to police.
There will be no contract deal Monday night between Chicago public school officials and the city's teacher's union, city school board President David Vitale said. Mayor Rahm Emanuel's spokeswoman, Sarah Hamilton, said talks were continuing late Monday, though Vitale said by then that he'd left the negotiating session for the night. "We said to them again, 'We should resolve this tomorrow, we are close enough,'" Vitale said. "This is hard work. We want to get this resolved. We want our kids back in school." The failure to produce a breakthrough comes a day after the Chicago Teacher's Union called a strike as school officials said they had nothing more to offer. The union has not stated, as of late Monday night, if the city's first teachers strike in 25 years will continue into a second day Tuesday in the absence of a deal. The strike left about 350,000 students with an unscheduled day off, and left some parents scrambling for alternatives. Police, expecting an uptick in trouble with more kids on the streets, pulled officers from desk duty to increase patrols due to the strike. Dozens of churches and civic organizations stepped in to provide activities for thousands of suddenly idle students, while the school district opened 144 of its 578 schools for part of the day to provide a safe environment and meals to children in need. Many children going to these in-school programs had to pass picket lines, as their teachers chanted, held signs and otherwise made their opinions heard. Ola Esho, father of a student at Ray Elementary School, told CNN affiliate WBBM he "was not happy" about the commotion and tension, which he said he unnerved his children. "I would not want to keep my children here unnecessarily, so I'm taking them back home," said Yahu Vinayaraj, another father of children at the same school in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood. The union that represents nearly 30,000 teachers and support staff in the nation's third-largest school district called the strike after negotiators failed to reach a contract agreement with school administrators despite eight months of talks. The union said they were close Sunday night to a deal on pay, but far apart on teacher evaluations, benefits and other issues. Opinion: Whole world is watching Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said teachers were harming Chicago's children by striking. "This is, in my view, a strike of choice, and it's the wrong choice for our children," he said. "Stay at the table. Finish it for our children." He said negotiators had resolved all but two issues -- teacher evaluations and provisions dealing with jobs for laid-off teachers. However, Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said teachers had no choice but to strike, despite "intense but productive" bargaining sessions. The primary disagreement appears to be teacher job security in the wake of a new program that evaluates teachers based on students' standardized test scores. Chicago Teachers Union board member Jay Rehak called the idea "data-driven madness." As many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system, according to Lewis, who called the system "unacceptable." The mayor's office, the city of Chicago, and school officials have questioned that job loss figure. Voices of the strike "This is no way to measure the effectiveness of an educator," Lewis said Sunday. "Further, there are too many factors beyond our control which impact how well some students perform on standardized tests such as poverty, exposure to violence, homelessness, hunger and other social issues beyond our control." Another sticking point is a "recall" policy that would put laid-off teachers in line for job openings at other schools within the district. Emanuel said such a policy, supported by the union, would take hiring decisions away from school principals and put them in the hands of central administrators and union leaders. "Direction and dictation should not come out of downtown," the mayor said. Teachers also want to block changes to their health benefits and win concessions on classroom conditions. Pay is also an issue. However, the union said the two sides are close to a pay agreement after school officials offered to increase salaries 16% over four years on average for most teachers. The average teacher salary in Chicago was $74,839 for the 2011-2012 school year, according to the district. In addition to the pay raise, the school system's offer includes paid maternity leave and short-term disability coverage. It would also freeze health care cost increases for two-thirds of the union's membership. The high school day would also be shortened slightly, and teachers would be limited to teaching five classes, the district said. The district's existing proposal would cost $400 million over four years, according to school board President David Vitale. Key issues in Chicago school strike Chicago schools can't afford more concessions, Vitale said. "We have no more flexibility when it comes to finance," he told CNN on Monday. At a midday news conference, Emanuel called the plan on the table an "honest compromise that respects our teachers, does right by our kids and is fair to our taxpayers." Union officials have said they are puzzled by the stance of Emanuel, the city's Democratic mayor, whom they accused of going back on promises to teachers, police officers and other civil servants, according to Rehak, the union board member. "He has definitely been a huge disappointment," Rehak said. "He has disrespected virtually every middle-class person in this city." Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, urged a quick resolution. "Both sides need to get back to the table as quickly as possible and really stay in there, negotiate through the night if necessary," he said Monday. "Get it over with quickly so that we can get these kids back in school." Read more about teacher unions on CNN's Schools of Thought blog About 50,000 Chicago students who attend charter schools are unaffected by the strike and will remain in class. But that still leaves the vast majority of students, whose parents were encouraged by the school district to "explore other options for their children" as long as the strike continues. "We know that a strike will put a strain on many families, and no one will be hurt more by a strike than our students," the district said on its website. One of the organizations opening doors for students during the strike is Young Chicago Authors, which has a free program for part of the day for students in grades six through 12. "In collaboration with core performance artists and special guests, young people will see the power of their voices in action through film, performance and discussion," the group said. Still, some parents were concerned about what would happen to their children during the strike. "If the kids are not in school, they're out getting into some kind of trouble ... when they should be in school, learning," said Shatara Scaggs, a mother of two children in kindergarten and first grade who opposes the teachers' decision to strike. "I think they should be in school getting an education." Are you there? Share your images and videos. CNN's Casey Wian, Greg Botelho, Ted Rowlands and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.
Beasts of burden, winners of wars and beloved as the sport of Kings -- now horses are being used to cure the ills of modern life. From the time ancient Egyptians worshiped feline deities, animals have been viewed as a source of strength and healing. Renowned psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed dogs helped his patients relax during sessions, while the Soviets used dolphins to treat people with mental health disorders in the 1980s. Today, rabbits, guinea pigs and even the humble gold fish are used to promote a sense of responsibility and wellbeing everywhere from the classroom to the retirement home. And an increasing number of mental health patients are turning to horses as a legitimate form of therapy -- claiming impressive results where traditional counseling has failed. No longer viewed as simply a crackpot alternative remedy for the rich and famous, equine therapy has gained a devoted following of psychoanalysts who say it has the power to heal people suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, phobias, anger issues and trauma. "It used to be seen as ridiculous, an airy fairy treatment used by celebrities with drug and alcohol addictions," said Mike Delaney, clinical director at Leading Equine Assisted Therapy (LEAP), based in Gloucestershire, south west England. "But attitudes have changed a lot. We're now a part of the British Association for Counseling & Psychotherapy (BACP) for example." The wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney helped boost equine therapy's public profile this year when she revealed it helped her overcome depression, after being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 14 years ago. Ann Romney, who co-owns a horse which competed in the London 2012 Olympic dressage competition, told ABC's "Good Morning America" that horses had motivated her to get out of bed, even in her darkest days. Across the pond, equine therapy is going from strength to strength, with the Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA), originally based in the U.S., training more than 1,500 therapists in Britain last year. The UK arm says they are now seeing hundreds of new inquiries, compared to just a handful a few years ago. Patients include domestic abuse victims, young offenders and servicemen suffering post traumatic stress -- often turning to their four-legged friends after finding traditional counseling failed them. Equine Assisted Therapy (EAT) usually involves the patient interacting with a horse, alongside a professional councilor and horse handler. Activities might include discussing the horse's character, teaching them to jump over obstacles, grooming and cleaning out stables. "For a woman who has been a victim of domestic violence, getting the horse to run around her in a circle, may seem simple, but it's a very powerful thing," Delaney, also clinical director at the Bayberry Clinic in Oxfordshire, in south east England, said. "Building a relationship with the horse and getting it to respect them, really builds self esteem and confidence." For people who find traditional psychoanalysis too intense, equine therapy can be a way of opening up dialogue with a councilor. "The thought of sitting in a room opposite a councilor and telling them the same story again is too much for some people, particularly children," Delaney said. "But when a horse pays attention to them, they get that sense of trust and love back. It enables traditional therapy to happen, rather than being its own thing." However, scientific evidence of its effectiveness remains thin on the ground, and is mostly anecdotal. "I've never heard of a medical referral for equine therapy," Psychotherapist Robin Walton, a member of the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), said. "But factors such as being outside and freed from the confines of an office could be tremendously beneficial for the relationship between the patient and therapist." Delaney recently completed a study in which 40 teenagers from sexually abusive backgrounds were treated with equine therapy once-a-week. The youngsters, aged between nine and 14-years-old, undertook horsemanship training and counselling as part of their eight-week treatment. "The change in their behavior was tangible," Delaney said. "The first week they were looking at the ground, too scared to interact with people. "By the end of the last week they were hugging people, dealing with their anger and managing their emotions." For patients coming from traumatic home lives, the fresh air of the great outdoors and chance to socialize, are just as much a part of the healing process as the horses themselves, added Delaney. A 14-year-old girl who was able to overcome her agoraphobia -- a fear of being in public places - was also highlighted by Dr Hannah Burgon, managing director at Sirona Therapeutic Horsemanship in Devon, south east England. "She had a love of horses, which was the motivating factor for getting her to leave the house," Dr Burgon said. "It helped her build up a relationship with the psychotherapist and work through a lot of issues." "She's now able to go on shopping trips with her mother and recently went on her first family holiday." However, therapy doesn't come cheap, with a 90-minute session at Sirona costing Â£82, usually run once-a-week over a six-week course. The healing power of horses goes back to an age-old relationship with man, according to Burgon. "We've got this innate connection to horses. They've been our transport, our friends, our beasts of burden, we've won wars on them," she said. "They've very social animals and the emotional part of their brain is very large. But there's also a powerful element to them. They're not domestic like dogs or cats, they're born wild and have to be tamed. You have to earn their trust." For some people who have come up against hardship, equine therapy may be just the thing to help them get back in the saddle of life.
"Build a biscuit, put a sheepdog on top," @sammsy posted to Twitter Thursday morning. It could be dismissed as just another nonsensical tweet, one of many that fill the social media space. But a closer look reveals the post is followed by a hashtag -- #surrenderyoursay -- and a link to www.surrenderyoursay.com. The site is home to a new project from the Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada. "Build a biscuit, put a sheepdog on top" is actually a verbal tic, and it's been posted to @sammsy's feed as part of project designed to raise awareness about Tourette Syndrome. Users surrendered their Twitter feeds to the project for 24 hours -- sign-up for the project closed late Thursday. During that time, a program posted tweets containing real-life verbal tics, sent to the foundation from people who have Tourette Syndrome. These could be anything from random sounds like "ins ins ins" to swear words to illogical sentences. "We were trying to think of a way to get people to experience Tourette Syndrome," art director Rachel Kennedy said. "Twitter is sort of like your online voice... you're judged on the things you are saying." People with Tourette Syndrome suffer from involuntary tics, which can be either verbal or physical. Physical tics may include jumping or twitching. People with the syndrome describe a tic like a sneeze -- impossible to hold in without extreme discomfort. Watch: 'American Idol' finalist James Durbin talks about life with Asperger and Tourette Syndrome Many know it only as the "swearing disease," but only about 10% of people with Tourette Syndrome swear, says Cathy Wylie, president of the Tourette Syndrome Foundation of Canada. "The people who have Tourette are really the same as the rest of us, with just these tics added in," Wylie said. "It doesn't affect anything else in their life." Wylie's son was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome 20 years ago. Back then there wasn't a lot of information available for families. Over time, awareness has increased, but it's still not a well-understood condition, Wylie says. "People looked at him like, 'You should behave -- why are you doing that?'" she remembers. "That's difficult when that's something you have no control over." It's unknown exactly how many children living in the United States or Canada have Tourette Syndrome. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that three of every 1,000 American children have been diagnosed; other estimates are slightly higher. What is known is that males are three times more likely to suffer than females, and that white children are diagnosed more often than Hispanic or non-Hispanic black children, according to the CDC. People with Tourette Syndrome usually have an associated disorder as well, Wylie said, such as attention deficit disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety, sleep problems and learning disabilities are also common. Users did not have to give the project their password or account information, and they were still able to log in and tweet during the 24-hour period. The additional tweets -- or tics -- happened at random intervals. More than 8,900 people agreed to give up their Twitter feeds to Surrender Your Say. Many signed up before the project launched at 9 a.m. ET on Wednesday. People were very apprehensive about losing control of their online presence, co-executive creative director Helen Pak said. "They say, 'I'm fearful to surrender for 24 hours and there are people who live with this all the time?'" For more information about Tourette Syndrome visit SurrenderYourSay.com.
The Dodge Neon sped down Interstate 40 in eastern Oklahoma, its occupants heading to Phoenix, Arizona, to buy a load of dope. It was May 2005. The couple brought along methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana to help pass the time on the long journey. Paul Faulkner, 83, and his son, Michael Smith, were convicted in a drug smuggling ring in north Georgia. At that moment, Detective Rob Rumble had no clue that the traffic stop he was about to make would launch a years-long drug investigation stretching more than 2,000 miles, from the remote mountains of northwest Georgia all the way down to Mexico. The investigation showed how an 83-year-old grandfather adapted to the times, morphing from old school bootlegging to dealing Mexican dope. His son acted as the ringleader of the operation. His grandson was tied in too, authorities say. "I've seen it all. Nothing surprises me," said Rumble, a drug investigator for the district attorney's office in east-central Oklahoma. After making that traffic stop, Rumble persuaded the nervous, lanky driver from Georgia to work with authorities and tell everything he knew. Investigators were led to a sleepy pocket of Georgia with scenic mountain views where people wave to strangers from their cars and where some homes still fly the Confederate flag.  Watch moonshine, marijuana and a family feud » It's the last place one might expect drugs from Mexico. But the demand for drugs is reaching even the most remote corners of America. Their story has all the intrigue of a classic Southern novel -- three generations of a family business on the wrong side of the law, complete with an old fashioned family feud. "When they're in that type of business, there's a reckoning day -- and apparently this is it," said Benny Perry, the 78-year-old mayor of Trion, Georgia, one of the towns where the family was operating. Perry is a barrel-chested man and speaks in a welcoming Southern accent. "I'll say this, I was completely surprised," he said. "I felt like we had a problem here, but I wouldn't have thought it was originating in Mexico and coming here." The drugs, mostly marijuana, were trucked from Mexico through California and Arizona and then distributed across five counties in Georgia and one in Tennessee, authorities say. They were hidden in just about anything -- furniture, roofs of big-rigs and tire wells. Once the shipments arrived, the dope was put in 50-caliber ammunition cans and buried in the woods, where buyers would pick up the stash and leave behind thousands in cash, authorities say.  See where the family operated » At the heart of the operation was 46-year-old Michael Leon Smith, who authorities say became one of the richest men in Chattooga County, population 25,000, as he laundered his drug money by buying up dozens of pieces of property. One tract of land sits on Old Justice Road, an ironic name considering the law finally caught up with him. Smith's 83-year-old father, Paul Leon Faulkner, was also busted. Eight others, including Faulkner's grandson (Smith's nephew), pleaded guilty to an array of charges related to the drug ring. The drugs mostly involved marijuana, but methamphetamine and cocaine were also part of the smuggling operation, authorities say. "We love it when somebody says they can't be caught," said Del Thomasson, a special agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation who worked the case. Faulkner, who is suffering from cancer, was handed a 20-year sentence last month and is to head to prison in August. "Twenty years, that is a death sentence," said Giles Jones, Faulkner's attorney, adding that he has appealed the sentence. He said Faulkner was a "full-time mountain shiner" who could talk moonshine until he was "blue in the face," but knew little about the Mexican marijuana operation. Jones said the old man's son "threw his ass under the bus" to save himself. "It's a situation where I guess you're just looking out for yourself. It's every day as every day, man," said Jones. Not so fast, said Cathy Alterman, the defense attorney for Smith, Faulkner's son. "Michael didn't throw his father under the bus. His father threw Michael down the drain when he was 16 years old," Alterman said. "If the father got a longer sentence, it's because he's a lousy father. ... He was never there for his son, except to be a bad example." Smith is serving a nine-year sentence in federal prison in Montgomery, Alabama. Faulkner's grandson is also serving a nine-year sentence. There is no parole in the federal system. Alterman said the sentences are excessive for people involved in dealing marijuana, a substance she says should be legalized. iReport.com: Time to legalize pot? "Michael's a wonderful family man, a Christian -- which means a lot to him, a very religious man. And I point out that in the Bible, God gave us every seed-bearing plant, and I think Michael looked at it that way. And, unfortunately, our government since 1937 has not seen it as a God-given right." Alterman is a defense attorney in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. She says about 90 percent of her clients are accused drug dealers, "most of them out of Mexico." Asked if Smith was dealing with people tied to Mexico's ruthless cartels, Alterman said, "Yes."  Learn more about Mexican cartels » "When you're selling in quantity -- all right, and Michael was selling in quantity -- you need someone who is able to give you a regular supply at a reasonable price, and so eventually Michael did end up buying from people who were from Mexico." The cartels are so organized, the money so great, that when an operation like this family's is taken down, it doesn't take long for others to move in. "Within 24 hours, if someone's arrested, someone else here already in the United States in the trade will take their place," Alterman said. "America does not know that the fingers of the cartels are basically around the throat of America," she added, "and it has spread out to rural America just as much as the inner city of Detroit." Authorities agree. Nearly every rural community is facing a similar battle, with drug dealers taking up shop in small towns where law enforcement has less of a presence and where the nation's highways make for easy transport. "I think people should care about what happens in a rural area, because let's face it, there are more rural areas than there are cities. Our community is not the only one affected," said GBI agent Thomasson. A Justice Department study released last year showed Mexican cartels had a presence in 230 U.S. cities, stretching from the U.S.-Mexican border to the Southeast and as far north as Alaska. The nation's rural communities are increasingly affected. See the cartels' urban hubs "Historically, rural America uses more alcohol and less drugs. That is changing," said Dr. H. Westley Clark, the director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. There have been few comprehensive studies over the last decade looking at the problem of drugs in rural America. According to a 2006 report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the use of illicit drugs in America is nearly the same in cities and rural areas, 8.7 percent compared to 7.8 percent respectively. Another report, in 2000 by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, found that eighth-graders living in rural America were 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana than in urban centers and 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine. In Trion, a town of about 2,000 people, a sign sits at the edge of the community in support of the local K-12 school. It reads, "Trion Bulldogs deserve a drug free community to live and grow!!" The words "drug free" are underlined. Many here are shocked to hear drugs from Mexico are coming through. Most don't like to talk on the record about the case because the family was well-known, even well-liked. "You got a guy who's a drug dealer, but you have good people in a community. I mean, they don't have a clue what's going on," Thomasson said. The town's mayor, Perry, said it's difficult to reconcile a "cordial" local family with the serious drug convictions. "You could talk to [them] ... and they would speak back," he said of Faulkner and Smith. "That's a big thing up here in a small town. If you speak to somebody and they don't speak back, you think, 'Well, something's wrong here.' " Perry said local authorities are trying "to stamp out the local demand," adding, "As long as we've got a market for it, they're gonna bring it up here." Alterman, the defense attorney, agrees. "Americans are screaming for drugs" and there's millions to be made, she said. "There's too much money involved."
Sporting a black t-shirt proudly proclaiming "Live 2 Break," a group of grinning boys form a slightly jagged circle inside a dusty yard on the outskirts of Kigali, Rwanda's capital. Inside the circle a bandana-wearing dance instructor spins from his back onto his chest flaring his legs high in the air in a V-shape. The boys respond to his virtuoso dance moves with claps and cheers before taking to the floor themselves, twisting and turning as they try to perfect their breakdance moves. They are part of an uplifting dance project at Les Enfants De Dieu, a residential care center working to transform the lives of former street children in Rwanda. The center accommodates 126 boys aged six to 18 who, apart from their tough upbringing, share a deep passion for an art form that also originated in the streets: Hip-hop. "Once their basic needs are fulfilled, they need to nourish their spirit, their self-esteem and their pride in themselves," says Nicola Triscott, co-founder of Catalyst Rwanda, a UK-based group that organizes art programs for vulnerable youth. "I think hip-hop really helps to do that, because it's such a young person's art form -- it came off the streets and it's about one-on-one teaching. There's this great spirit of sharing in hip hop," she adds. Read more: Film pioneer helps Rwanda build new identitys Last year, Catalyst Rwanda responded to the kids' wish to learn how to "break" -- hip-hop's original dance form -- by taking legendary British breaker Pervez to the tiny African country. The project was an instant success: For 10 days, the center's courtyards were turned into makeshift dance floors as Pervez taught the children how to develop their breaking skills and allowed them to express themselves. "I remember the first day when the people came here to teach them how to dance hip-hop, I was really, myself, in heaven," says Rafiki Callixte, 43, project manager at the center. He says the children were living a tough, hopeless life in the streets. They had no time to laugh or relax as they always had to take care of themselves. Their story has been immortalized in "Yes, Man!" a short documentary film screening Thursday at the Africa Utopia festival in London. "Now, to see them smiling, without stress, (being) enthusiastic, open, very active and then seeing also some children around appreciating the ones who were dancing, you could understand how dancing is helping them to come out of themselves, to express their inner harmony, their inner happiness and forget the hard life they have experienced." Old friends meet again It all began after Triscott received a Facebook message from Callixte in 2010, asking her if she still remembered him. The two had met in the early 1990s in Rwanda when Nicola was traveling across Africa. They became friends and stayed in touch via mail but in 1994, as Rwanda was being torn apart by genocide, their communication broke down. Triscott knew that Callixte was in danger and assumed that he had died, as he hadn't replied to the last letter she sent him in 1994. Callixte was alive and had only lost her address. He had been a teacher before the war, and in the years after the genocide, he embarked on a mission to help his country's vulnerable street children, including those orphaned by the genocide and by HIV/AIDS. He joined Les Enfants De Dieu in 2004. Read more: Rwanda's 'peace' baskets heal wounds Soon after receiving Callixte's Facebook message, Nicola jumped on a plane to visit her old friend. It was while in Kigali that she discovered his inspiring work at the center's children. "I thought they were an extraordinary group of young men," remembers Triscott, 47, who noticed "how much they loved hip hop," so she asked them if there was anything she could do to help. "We'd really like proper hip-hop dance lessons," the boys told Triscott, prompting her to return to Rwanda with Pervez last November. Genocide aftermath In Rwanda, where 800,000 people died in just 100 days during the 1994 genocide , nearly 43% of the population are children up to 14 years old. An estimated one million orphans and "other vulnerable children" live in the country, according to UNICEF. Les Enfants De Dieu says that communities are not often able to deal with the direct and indirect effects of the genocide, leading to thousands of children taking to the streets. Many of them suffer from neglect and abuse, while others resort to drug use. The center, which was founded in 2002, provides the boys with food, a place to sleep and healthcare. It also offers sports training, as well as education at school and vocational training at various centers -- all part of efforts to help the children remove the trauma of street life through rehabilitation. Ultimately, the center's goal is to reintegrate the children into the society once they are entirely rehabilitated. "Children of the street are children like the others," says former street kid Willy in "Yes, Man!" "When they get love, they are children like the others. So, when they get someone who helps them, who takes care of them, they will become a real man," adds Willy, 18, who spent four and a half years on the street before going to live at Les Enfants De Dieu. Catalyst Rwanda is planning to bring more professional hip-hop dancers to Rwanda this year to show the children more moves and boost their confidence. Callixte says dancing has given hope back to the children, prompting some to even start composing their own songs. "They love hip hop so much. Now, many of them are dancing to songs they have made themselves." He says this is only the beginning. "When you see them dancing, when you see them smiling, when you see them expressing themselves, when you see them appreciating each other ... you can never think about stopping that project."
When golfers admit to feeling "brain dead" and "unconscious" -- as Rory McIlroy did at Muirfield on Thursday -- perhaps it's time to book an appointment with the doctor. Dr Bob Rotella that is; the legendary mind coach who has helped some of the game's biggest names like Keegan Bradley, Padraig Harrington and Darren Clarke plot their way to major success. McIlroy's very public loss of form ended with a disheartening opening round of eight-over-par in Scotland and those comments to the media gave an insight into his present trouble state of mind. But the good news is that if the beleaguered former world No. 1 wants to pick up the phone to Rotella, the revered coach would be only too happy to help. "Anybody would love to work with Rory," Rotella exclusively told CNN. "He's a really good kid, he has a lot of talent and he loves golf. Even people who love golf in some moments can feel bad about it but I've never seen him at a stage where he hates it. "I think he probably feels like it's getting hard at the moment. Sometimes this game is so easy for someone like him -- it's ridiculous how easy it can be. "But even for them sometimes you say 'Where is it? Where did it go? When is it coming back?' That's the big question. "I spent some time with him a few years ago at The Masters. Perhaps it was nothing to do with me but the next week he won at Charlotte for the first time in the U.S. and he has obviously played some incredible golf (since)." McIlroy's form has dipped ever since he was launched as a new Nike protÃ©gÃ© in a blaze of publicity at the start of this year. So, is he struggling with his new clubs or are off the course distractions, like his romance with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, limiting his time on the range? Whatever is behind his malaise, the 24-year-old, who has won two majors, is still brutally honest about his current failings, laying his feelings bare in that startling press conference. So what did Rotella make of his comments? "First of all, it says to me that he's a young man who's very comfortable with himself and he feels good enough about himself that he is comfortable talking about it," added Rotella, who has been coaching amateur players in HSBC's golf zone. "That's a good sign. This is the most honest thing any of us will ever do in our life -- playing golf. "Rory sounds like he knows he's not where he needs to be or was when he was playing his best and he knows he's got to get back there. But that's pretty common. We've just seen Tiger Woods go through two or three years of struggling with it. "What usually happens is you reach a certain point when you sink to a level and then say 'This is ridiculous.' At that point you simplify everything, stop over-analysing and go out there and kick some butt. "What the world needs to understand is that he's only half an inch away. It happens a lot in the world of sport, not just in golf. Rory's been a very skilled, confident, successful player for a long time. "He will be back, it's just a matter of how long will it take." Many commentators on the game have suggested McIlroy seek Rotella out while he is in situ at Muirfield. He's a champion in his own right at focusing players and encouraging them to adopt routines that will keep them calm in the pressure cooker atmosphere of a major championship. So where would he start if McIlroy -- who reportedly told the Times newspaper that "it could be beneficial to see someone like Rotella again" -- wanders into his surgery in the next few hours? "I'd probably want to hear him tell me what is going on, to find out if what he said to the media is what really is going on," Rotella explained. "The biggest thing is to say 'That round is over, forget about it. The only thing that matters now is getting in a great state of mind to go out there and whether it's to see how low you can shoot, make the most birdies and break the course record.' "That's the mind-set you have to have. Sometimes when you're way back it makes it easier to free up and throw away all the doubt, fear and questions marks and go for it. "But you have to combine that with patience -- that's the difficulty on a course this tough."
a decision he says he will announce by March -- he will face a monumental challenge. He isn't a registered Democrat, but would be vying for the party's presidential nomination. He doesn't have much name recognition, but would be likely going up against the uber-recognizable Hillary Clinton. And as of late, it doesn't even seem like he has the support of his base. Liberal group MoveOn.Org ready to kick-off $1 million campaign In the last few months, the liberal activists inside the Democratic Party have been organizing around the possibility of a long-shot presidential run by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, not Sanders' seemingly more likely run. Liberal groups have been pining for a Warren run for months and on Tuesday, a coalition of groups announced they would kick off their efforts in New Hampshire with a rally and plans to open local offices. This comes despite the fact Warren bluntly said "no" when asked if she was running in 2016. Sanders' hope, although he is somewhat loathe to admit it, is that he will someday get that same support. "Obviously one would hope one would have as much support as possible from all walks of life," he said on Tuesday when asked why he thinks those groups aren't rallying around him. "I am a great fan of Elizabeth and as for what people do and why they don't do it, I am not going to speculate." Ben Wikler, the Washington Director of Move On, said that although MoveOn members have "enormous respect for Bernie Sanders," it is Warren who is "on fire." With a new knee, Webb's still considering 2016 plans "Sen. Warren is perfectly in tune with this moment in history and her message, which has been a consistent, singularly focused message ... resonates with an almost electric energy," Wikler said. A source at MoveOn, however, was more blunt in their assessment of why Warren over Sanders. "You can see when the needle breaks the gauge," the source said. "It happens with Warren. It happens with Warren in a way that it doesn't happen with anyone else right now." This is a problem for Sanders: The people he could once rely on -- liberal organizers -- have found someone else to support. "If we can't do that," Sanders said on invigorating the grassroots to get around him, "then I am not going to [run]." Campaign should focus on issues, not personality Sanders is the most serious progressive candidate actively entertaining a run at the presidency in 2016. He has taken a number of trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, two presidential mainstays, and regularly speaks at liberal conferences across the country. On Tuesday, in an editorial board meeting with CNN, he reiterated that he was strongly considering a run as either a Democrat or a independent. But that is about all he was interested in talking about regarding 2016. Torture report splits 2016 Democrats "Ten minutes into this discussion and no one has asked me about any of the major issues facing this country," Sanders said after a group of CNN producers and reporters peppered him with questions about the race, Hillary Clinton and his prospects for running. "[I have] no intention of taking on Hillary Clinton, that is not the issue, that is the wrong question," he said. "I am not taking on Hillary Clinton. I am taking on the issues." To Sanders, elections should be more simplified. Candidates outline where they stand on complex issues, devoid of personality politics and poll questions about who Americans would rather have a beer with. A number of times in the hour, Sanders -- a senator who has come to be known as much for his fly-away hair as his passionate speeches in the Senate -- bluntly lamented the way political journalism in the United States focuses on personality as it does. "I think this is not about personality," Sanders said, raising his Vermonter-by-way-of-New York voice. "I am not a singer, I am not a dancer, I am not an entertainer." These 2016 long-shots think they can win? Sanders would rather have voters know his policies, than his favorite vacation destination or his childhood icons. In Sander's view, it was personality -- not policy -- that elected former President George W. Bush, someone the independent says was a "very nice guy ... but the worst president this country has had." "I think the media, and I have to throw this back at you guys, makes it too easy to cover my grandchildren," he said. "Or Mitt Romney's dog riding on the top of his car. Very interesting, but it is not important."
Zimbabwe's central bank introduced a $10 billion note worth less than 20 U.S. dollars, as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe at Zanu-PF National Political Commissar Elliot Manyika's burial last week The new note, expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread, comes just a week after Zimbabwe issued a $500 million note to ease a cash shortage. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Gideon Gono said the $10 billion note was being introduced for the "convenience of the public ahead of the festive season." On Thursday, the U.S. dollar traded for about 600 million Zimbabwe dollars, and the hyperinflation was expected to continue. People slept overnight at the bank doors, hoping to get money for the next day. President Robert Mugabe apologized to his ZANU-PF party supporters Thursday for the problems Zimbabweans were facing but insisted his nation has turned a corner in its fight against its worst humanitarian crisis, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported. Shortages of most essentials such as electricity, fuel, medicine and food have become a common feature in Zimbabwe, forcing people to flee the country. Zimbabwe has slashed zeros from the amount of its worthless currency during the past two years -- the latest being 10 zeros in August. Once one of Africa's most promising economies, Zimbabwe is reeling under its worst humanitarian and economic crisis. A cholera outbreak has killed more than 1,000 Zimbabweans since August, forcing hundreds to cross the border into South Africa and Botswana to seek treatment. Five million people are in need of food aid in a nation that once exported food to its neighbors, the United Nations says. But Mugabe -- blamed for the crisis by his critics -- said the worst was over. He said he was optimistic about resuscitating the power-sharing deal he signed with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in September, the Herald reported. "We will be inviting the two leaders -- Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai and Professor Arthur Mutambara -- to come and discuss the way forward," Mugabe said. The deal has yet to take effect, as Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for grabbing all key ministries such as home affairs, local government, finance, home affairs, information and defense. Mugabe said Western nations and neighboring Botswana were against the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe. "I was reading recent utterances by Condoleezza Rice that African leaders are not prepared to topple President Mugabe and bring about regime change," he said. "She condemned this inability on the part of African leaders. How could African leaders ever topple Robert Mugabe, organize an army to come? It is not easy. I do not know of any African country that is brave enough to do that. "Botswana is making some stupid noises. They are just hollow noises to assure the MDC that the Botswana government supports it and also in response to Britain and America that Botswana is a good mouthpiece of the white men." The MDC is Tsvangirai's opposition party -- Movement for Democratic Change. On cholera, Mugabe said the country was failing to import adequate water treating chemicals because of the sanctions imposed by the west.
(CNN)Prominent Bangladeshi-American blogger Avijit Roy began one of his final articles by writing that January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in France was "a tragic atrocity committed by soldiers of the so-called religion of peace." He recalled the case of another secular blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider, who was hacked to death outside his home in Bangladesh in February 2013 by assailants with machetes. "The virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible," Roy wrote in the article, which is to be published in Free Inquiry magazine in April. On Thursday night, the engineer and writer known for speaking out for secular freedom died after being attacked by machete-wielding assailants in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, a local police official said. Roy, the founder of the website Mukto-Mona, and his wife were assaulted as they walked back from a speaking engagement, said Krishna Pada Roy, a deputy commissioner with the Dhaka police. Police were investigating a "local hard-line religious group" that praised the killing online, the BBC reported. Ajay Roy, Avijit's father, filed a case of murder with the Shahbagh police on Friday without naming suspects. The father, a retired professor at Dhaka University, later told reporters his son was killed by extremist and communal groups backed by Jamaat-e-Islami, the main Islamist political party in the country.  Avijit Roy had received death threats several times for posting his views on blog, his father said. Jamaat-e-Islami, however, protested Ajay Roy's statement and demanded punishment of the killers. Shahbagh police officer-in-charge Sirajul Islam said, "The nature of the attack suggests a fanatic group might have been behind the murder." Images published Friday on the blog of another prominent writer from Bangladesh show Roy, surrounded by onlookers, lying face down in a pool of blood. "Bangladesh has become a safe haven for Islamists where they can do whatever they like," Taslima Nasreen, who had to leave Bangladesh after receiving death threats from extremists, wrote in her blog. "They can kill people with no qualms whatsoever. Avijit Roy has been killed the way other free-thinking writers were killed in Bangladesh. No free thinker is safe in Bangladesh." Roy died at a nearby hospital, the police official said. His wife suffered injuries of her own, including a severed finger. The attackers carried knives and machetes. A witness said an assailant pulled out "a big knife" and struck Roy from behind in the head and shoulders. Roy's wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna,  also was hacked on the shoulders. "I shouted for help from the people but nobody came to save him," the witness told CNN. "No one came." Last year, an Islamist activist said that Roy "will be murdered when he comes back" to Bangladesh, the author wrote in the Free Inquiry article. Roy reported such threats on his life, according to people who knew him. Despite threats, the writer regularly returned to Bangladesh for the February book fairs, said Michael De Dora, a friend of Roy's. "Avijit was very idealistic," he said. "His understanding was that he wouldn't be killed, that if anyone ever tried to attack him or hated him, that they could just kind of have a chat and he would convince them ... that they could at least have a dialogue." De Dora said Roy, who was an American citizen, reported last year's threat to the FBI, but the author was skeptical of alerting Bangladeshi authorities. "For him, even if he was getting threats that he thought were serious, to not be able to go back to his home country and meet with activists and other bloggers and writers would be kind of horrible thought for him," De Dora said. As in France after Islamic extremists murdered 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, Roy's killing has generated public outcry and demonstrations in Bangladesh. "Dhaka University is a cradle of exercising free thoughts and democracy," Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA) said, according to the national news agency of Bangladesh, BSS. "For these reasons, the communal extremists chose the university campus to launch attacks on persons of progressive conscience." In the Free Inquiry article, Roy wrote compared religious extremism to "a highly contagious virus." When his book, "The Virus of Faith," was released at a book fair last year, he wrote that the publication "hit the cranial nerve of Islamic fundamentalists," who started threatening his life. "The death threats started flowing to my e-mail inbox on a regular basis," Roy wrote. "A well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through through his numerous Facebook statuses." In one widely-circulated post, Roy quotes the extremist as writing, "Avijit Roy lives in America and so, it is not possible to kill him right now. But he will be murdered when he comes back." The Charlie Hebdo massacre, the threats on his life, the removal of his books from a Bangladesh online bookstore after pressure from extremists prove that "the virus of faith is dangerously real," Roy wrote. Roy and his wife were attacked on the Dhaka University campus as they were leaving a book fair where Roy had spoken. Based out of the Atlanta area, Roy was a "prominent defender of the free thought movement (and) advocate of atheism, science and metaphysical naturalism," according to his website. He authored seven books and his writings were also featured in numerous magazines and journals. The couple has a daughter, Trisha Ahmed, a student at Johns Hopkins University, De Dora said. Roy's outspokenness, especially on matters of religion, made him a target in Bangladesh, where nearly 90% of people are Muslim and 10% are Hindu, according to the U.S. government. A September 2013 blog post by Roy was headlined, "Happy Blasphemy Day, Happy Birthday 'Mukto Mona.'" Roy wrote that the day is "dedicated to those who are systematically being persecuted, harassed, or killed for their simple expression of Freethought (more precisely, for their 'blasphemous' views towards religion)." Countries such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Bangladesh have "retained social ideas that are reminiscent of the medieval age," when blasphemy laws were "equated with sin," the author wrote. In Bangladesh, bloggers were jailed "on the sole basis that they were openly atheist," he wrote. In Pakistan, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reported at least 203 incidents of violence "in the name of religion," resulting in more than 700 deaths in an 18-month period. In Saudi Arabia, he wrote, a 19-year-old gang-rape victim was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail for "indecency" and speaking to the press. "The nonbelievers in these Islamic countries face the most severe treatment at the hands of both mullahs and the state," Roy wrote. De Dora, director of the Amherst, New York-based Center for Inquiry's office of public policy, called the author's death "a great loss." "Avijit was brilliant, yes, and a devoted advocate of free expression and secularism, but also just a very good person," he said in a statement. "Avijit was an inspiration to countless other freethinkers, in Bangladesh and around the world, and he was an inspiration to me." Bangladeshi Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammad Nasim condemned the killing and called for the "expeditious nabbing of the killers and their exemplary punishment," the BSS news agency reported. Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu "expressed deep sorrow and sympathy at the untimely death" on the same news site. Jadabeswar Bhattacharjee, a contributor to Mukto-Mona, posted Friday that Roy had been killed by "some brain-dead Islamist bigots." "I have no word to condemn this heinous crime perpetuated by these Islamist cowards," he wrote. "When such Islamist cowards failed in intellectual discourse with Avijit and when they found that their dogma has been proved hollow by Avijit, they settled the score by murdering him." Bob Churchill, a spokesman for the London-based International Humanist and Ethical Union, said the "loss is keenly felt by freethinkers and humanists in South Asia and around the world" and called Roy "a colleague in humanism and a friend to all who respect human rights, freedom, and the light of reason." The IHEU said in a statement that an Islamist activist "well-known" to authorities early last year threatened Roy and "repeatedly and openly talked about wanting to see secular and freethought writers dead." "Those under threat have complained that authorities have ignored his threats and incitement, despite his credible links to Islamist extremists and similar murders taking place," the statement said. There was no immediate response to the claim from authorities in Bangladesh. CNN's Lonzo Cook, Greg Botelho, Farid Ahmed and John Couwels contributed to this report.
President Obama announced new steps to help unemployed Americans on Friday, targeting people who are out of work and want to go back to school. President Obama has made education reform a top legislative priority. The president outlined a plan under which the Department of Education will send colleges legal guidance, encouraging them to increase financial aid packages for the unemployed so they can enroll in educational and training programs while keeping their unemployment benefits. Under Obama's initiative, colleges would consider a person's current financial situation to make it possible for them to receive Pell grants, which are available for low-income students. The unemployed person would not lose any unemployment benefits and the maximum Pell grant would be increased in July by $500 to $5,350. Current unemployment rules create a Catch-22: In most cases, if you are receiving unemployment compensation, you have to be actively looking for a job. If you want to get more education or training, you have to give up unemployment benefits. But if you return to school, you don't qualify for federal education grants since, in most cases, your qualification is based on the previous year's income. The government has started a Web site with information on the plan: www.opportunity.gov. The Labor Department will also issue guidance "strongly encouraging" states to modernize their rules to allow more unemployed to continue their education without forfeiting their benefits. "In a 21st-century economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, education is the single best bet we can make," Obama said. The unemployment system should not just be a safety net but "a stepping stone to a new future. ... It should offer folks educational opportunities they wouldn't otherwise have and give them the measurable and differentiated skills they need to not just get through these hard times but to get ahead when the economy comes back." Obama's remarks came shortly after the government announced that the unemployment rate hit a 25-year high in April, rising to 8.9 percent from 8.5. percent in March. There were signs of hope, however, as the monthly job loss total fell to the lowest level in six months. CNN's Jill Doherty and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.
The officer who arrested a top African-American professor said talks over beers Thursday evening at the White House were productive and the two men plan to meet again. Sgt. James Crowley and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. sit down with the president and vice president Thursday. Sgt. James Crowley and Henry Louis Gates Jr. sat around a patio table with President Obama and Vice President Biden, drank beer, munched on snacks and talked about the arrest that has sparked debate about racial profiling and police procedures. "It was a private discussion. It was a frank discussion," Crowley said of the meeting, but would not divulge specifics except to say that no one apologized. Crowley said he and Gates will speak by telephone in the coming days to finalize details of their next meeting. Both men bring different perspectives, he said, but he would like to hear more about Gates' views. Gates was arrested July 16 and accused of disorderly conduct after police responded to a report of a possible burglary at his Boston-area home. The charge was later dropped. Crowley and Gates, both dressed in suits, sat down with Obama and Biden, who both had their white dress shirt sleeves rolled up. Video from the meeting showed mugs of beer being delivered to the men, who sat at a round table at the edge of the White House's Rose Garden, eating peanuts and pretzels from silver bowls. The president was drinking Bud Light, Biden was drinking Buckler (a nonalcoholic beer), Gates was drinking Samuel Adams Light and Crowley was drinking Blue Moon. After the meeting, Crowley told reporters that the men had a "cordial and productive discussion," in which they agreed to move foward rather than dwell on past events.  Watch Crowley discuss his visit » After the meeting, the renowned Harvard professor reflected on the significance of the event and thanked Obama for arranging the meeting. "It is incumbent upon Sergeant Crowley and me to utilize the great opportunity that fate has given us to foster greater sympathy among the American public for the daily perils of policing on the one hand, and for the genuine fears of racial profiling on the other hand," Gates said in a statement on his Web site, The Root. "Let me say that I thank God that (I) live in a country in which police officers put their lives at risk to protect us every day, and, more than ever, I've come to understand and appreciate their daily sacrifices on our behalf. I'm also grateful that we live in a country where freedom of speech is a sacrosanct value and I hope that one day we can get to know each other better, as we began to do at the White House this afternoon over beers with President Obama," he said. iReport.com: Police, public share views on racial profiling "At this point, I am hopeful that we can all move on, and that this experience will prove an occasion for education, not recrimination. I know that Sergeant Crowley shares this goal. Both of us are eager to go back to work tomorrow." After the incident, Obama himself quickly got involved, saying at a news conference that police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, "acted stupidly." His comment itself drew criticism and later he softened his stance, saying, "I could've calibrated those words differently."  Watch report on fallout from president's comment » After the meeting, Obama said in a statement he was thankful to Gates and Crowley for joining him at for "a friendly, thoughtful conversation. "Even before we sat down for the beer, I learned that the two gentlemen spent some time together listening to one another, which is a testament to them," the president's statement said. "I have always believed that what brings us together is stronger than what pulls us apart. I am confident that has happened here tonight, and I am hopeful that all of us are able to draw this positive lesson from this episode."  Watch report from CNN's Dan Lothian on visit » Earlier Thursday, Obama said the chat was prompted by an exchange he had with Crowley, who said in a phone call with Obama, "Maybe I'll have a beer in the White House someday." The president replied that that could be arranged. On the meeting's being dubbed the "Beer Summit," Obama said, "It's a clever term, but this is not a summit, guys. This is three folks having a drink at the end of the day, and hopefully giving people an opportunity to listen to each other, and that's really all it is. "This is not a university seminar. It is not a summit. It's an attempt to have some personal interaction when an issue has become so hyped and so symbolic that you lose sight of just the fact that these are people involved," he said. He said he would be surprised if the media makes the meeting out to be more important than his meeting Thursday with Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, president of the Philippines, but "the press has surprised me before." Gates and Crowley brought their families to the White House, and the two toured the East Wing together before the meeting, officials said. The two met Obama in the Oval Office before moving out to the Rose Garden. Their families were touring the West Wing during the sit-down. Separately, a Boston, Massachusetts, police officer became part of the controversy by referring to Gates in a mass e-mail as a "banana-eating jungle monkey." Officer Justin Barrett later apologized, saying he's not a racist. He told a local television station on Wednesday night that he was sorry for the e-mail. "I regret that I used such words," Barrett told CNN affiliate WCVB. "I have so many friends of every type of culture and race you can name. I am not a racist." He was placed on administrative leave after the e-mail surfaced, and he might lose his job as a result. Barrett's attorney, Peter Marano, on Thursday offered an apology on his behalf.  Watch Boston's top cop call for discipline » "Justin Barrett is a citizen, a husband, a father, a soldier, a police officer and a human being," Marano said in a statement. "He has made a mistake -- his poor choice in words is that mistake. His lack of thought into the possible outcome of using such words has caused this debate. Justin never intended for these words to bear such a racial connotation." Meanwhile, a black Cambridge police sergeant on the scene the day of Gates' arrest wrote a letter to Crowley, asking him to mention to Gates and Obama that he is now known as the "black sergeant" and to some others as an "uncle Tom." "I'm forced to ponder the notion that as a result of speaking the truth and coming to the defense of a friend and colleague, who just happens to be white, that I have somehow betrayed my heritage," Sgt. Leon Lashley wrote. "Please convey my concerns to the president that Mr. Gates' actions may have caused grave and potentially irreparable harm to the struggle for racial harmony in this country and perhaps throughout the world." Lashley wrote in the letter he would like Gates to reflect on the incident and ask himself what responsibility he bears, what he can do to heal the rift and what he can do to mitigate the damage done to the officers' reputations.
Two years removed from his disastrous 2012 presidential bid, Rick Perry is fully recovered from back surgery, sporting new glasses, reengaging with the Republican conservative base, and showing signs that he's considering another run for the White House. Immigration policy helped sink the Texas governor's previous bid, but it has now put him back in the spotlight. He met on Wednesday with President Barack Obama, who's under fire over the surge of undocumented minors on the southern border. Obama accepted Perry's offer for a sit-down following a sharp exchange with the White House. Last week, White House spokesman Josh Earnest mocked his message on immigration, saying "the truth is it's hard to take seriously Governor Perry's concerns." Perry points to his state's long border with Mexico as ground zero for the crush of mostly children entering the United States illegally. "My message to President Obama is to secure this border, Mr. President. Finally address this issue and secure this border," Perry said last week at a congressional hearing near the border in McAllen, Texas. But he may have disappointed fellow conservatives when he said that he was "tired of pointing fingers and blaming people." He added, "I hope what we can do is come up with some solutions here." Perry used more muscular language days later when he said, "this is a failure of diplomacy. It is a failure of leadership from the administration in Washington, D.C." Jeff Miller, a senior Perry political adviser, told CNN that Perry "is not saying anything different than what he's being advocating since 2010 -- that 'we've got to secure this border. There's a crisis going on.'" Obama wants $3.7 billion for immigration crisis But Miller said the current crisis is giving Perry a larger platform. "Right now, because of the huge influx of these children crossing the border from Mexico, the media's paying more attention and more of the public is seeing the crisis the governor has been dealing with for years. Not a lot has changed, but now more people are listening to what the governor's saying," Miller said. Immigration helped sink Perry in 2012 While a real front-burner issue in his state, Perry is also seeing political stars align. Immigration was the issue that damaged him more than any other when he ran for president last time, people close to him say. Perry launched his presidential campaign in August 2011, months after former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and the rest of the field of candidates had jumped in. Perry entered with lots of buzz and armed with big bucks and big name backers, and he quickly soared in national polls. But good times were fleeting, as Perry soon ran headfirst into Romney on illegal immigration. In a debate a month later, Perry defended his support for government-funded tuition at state schools for undocumented immigrants. He argued that if you didn't support such a move, "I don't think you have a heart." But some of his Republican rivals considered that soft. "Governor Perry, you say you have got the experience. It's a bit like saying that, you know, the college coach that has lost 40 games in a row has the experience to go to the NFL," said Romney at another debate. Rick Perry's busy summer "The truth is, California -- I'll say it again, California and Florida have both had no increase in illegal immigration and yours is up 60 percent." Romney added. Sources close to Perry tell CNN they believe that moment did more to hurt Perry with GOP primary voters than any other. Still, Perry suffered a more memorable blow with an epic gaffe in a November 2011 debate, when he forgot the third of three federal government departments that he had said he would eliminate. Perry's campaign limped on, but he called it quits after a disappointing fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Political resurrection? Fast forward two years. Perry decides not to run for re-election and is again making his pitch to conservative voters. "I have a simple suggestion -- It is time for a little rebellion on the battlefield of ideas," Perry told the base at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference. And Perry's summer travel plans hint toward a 2016 bid. He recently made his third trip over the past year to South Carolina -- the state the holds the first southern primary. The visit to the Palmetto State precedes upcoming stops this summer in Iowa and New Hampshire. Perry even hosted a group of more than a dozen key New Hampshire Republicans at the Governor's Mansion in Austin a few weeks ago to wine and dine them, CNN is told. When he goes to the Granite State next month, it will be his first trip there since 2012, when he failed to make much of an impression at all on voters there. A veteran New Hampshire Republican ally setting up New Hampshire meetings tells CNN they are consciously doing things differently this time. They're opting for a manner more conducive to the way New Hampshire voters like to be approached, in a series of small, intimate meetings. But the tactical shortcomings from 2012 is not the only thing he's trying to improve ahead of another possible candidacy -- it's also his readiness on a policy level. Perry urges Congress, Obama to work together on border security Perry sources admit that he simply wasn't up to speed on many of the key issues that confront a candidate, never mind a president. To overcome that, he now has multiple policy briefings a week, every week on issues ranging from economic policy, to education, to the environment to national security. One source tells CNN that if he is traveling and there is a think tank nearby, he will make a point of stopping for a briefing from experts. Perry has also been trying to do more international travel, attending the highbrow annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, going to Israel, and planning a trip later this year to China. But it's firestorm over immigration that may give Perry his biggest opportunity for political resurrection. Miller downplayed any impact from the current immigration crisis on a potential 2016 bid, saying "to me these are two completely separate issues." But GOP analyst Ana Navarro, a CNN contributor who's close to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another possible 2016 GOP presidential contender, said "Perry embodies an interesting dynamic regarding immigration. "He's a border enforcement guy with the experience of being a border state governor, but he's also shown compassion towards the human angle of the immigration debate," she said. Navarro added that "If he can somehow walk that tight rope, and be eloquent as to how he defends his position, it can show him as a pragmatist and be helpful."

Patrick Vieira will forever be known as a World Cup winner, but had the country of his birth acted quicker his destiny might have turned out rather differently. Vieira was a member of the France side that landed football's greatest prize on home soil in 1998, but having been born in Dakar, Senegal, the former Arsenal captain has often faced questions as to why he didn't play for the country of his birth. Notably from former midfielder rival Roy Keane who reportedly said in 2005: "It makes me laugh, players going on about how they are saving this country and saving that country but when they have the opportunity to play...well, it's probably none of my business." Vieira attributes his decision to play for les bleus partly to the Senegalese Football Federation's failure to notice his burgeoning talent following his move to France as an eight-year-old. "I didn't have anybody from the Senegalese national team who came to me and proposed for me to play in the national team so the question was never there," Vieira told CNN. He came on as a second-half substitute in the 1998 World Cup final against Brazil, delivering the pass for Emmanuel Petit's third goal in the 3-0 victory over the reigning world champions at the Stade de France. And having won 107 caps for France between 1997 and 2009, Vieira has no regrets about the decision he made. The 37-year-old arrived in France with his family, who were seeking a better way of life, and he remains forever grateful for the opportunity that the European nation presented him with. "I enjoyed playing for the national team, the French national team, because I think France gave me a lot and gave my family a lot, so to wear the French national team shirt was really good and I wore it with pride," he said. "It had never been a decision to choose between the French national team or the Senegalese national team because I was growing up in France and playing in the French youth national team so it was something really normal." Eligible to play for France through his grandfather, Vieira went on to become the the fifth most-capped Frenchman behind Lilian Thuram, Thierry Henry, Marcel Desailly and Zinedine Zidane. Along with Vieira, that quartet of players was key to France's World Cup win in 1998 and the European Championship two years later. Senegal's inability to spot Vieira as a youngster and secure his international future provides evidence of African football's structural failings, argues the current head of Manchester City's elite development squad. "I think what African football needs is better organization, better structure, and I think after that we'll help the players to be more professional when they're coming to play for their national team," he said. "And I think the federations have a massive responsibility on their shoulders because we know there is talent. "When you look at the last five-to-six years, the number of players we had like Yaya Toure, Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto'o, Kolo Toure, Salomon Kalou and Jay Jay Okocha -- I can give you hundreds of names. "I think the structure around these players is not strong enough and I think if we don't have that, it will take time [for an African nation] to win the World Cup."
A Pennsylvania woman has been indicted for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. Colleen LaRose, known as "Jihad Jane" and "Fatima LaRose," has also been charged with making false statements to a government official and attempted identity theft. She was arrested in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 15, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office said. No arraignment date has been set, the official said. LaRose is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. LaRose and five unindicted co-conspirators recruited men on the Internet "to wage violent jihad in South Asia and Europe, and recruited women on the Internet who had passports and the ability to travel to and around Europe in support of violent jihad," according to a Justice Department statement. Irish police arrest 7 on murder plot charges If convicted, LaRose faces a possible life prison sentence and a $1 million fine, the statement said. The conspiracy began in June 2008, when LaRose posted a comment on YouTube under the username JihadJane saying she is "desperate to do something somehow to help" Muslims, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday. From December 2008 to October 2009, LaRose engaged in electronic communication with the five co-conspirators about their shared desires to wage jihad and become martyrs, according to the indictment. Read the indictment (PDF) LaRose and the co-conspirators, according to the statement, used the Internet to establish relationships with each another and develop plans "which included martyring themselves, soliciting funds for terrorists, soliciting passports and avoiding travel restrictions (through the collection of passports and through marriage) in order to wage violent jihad." According to a U.S. government official familiar with the case, LaRose was successful in recruiting some people to join the cause. She also was able to raise money, the official said, adding that she was in contact with committed jihadists in South Asia, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. The official declined to link her to any specific terrorist organizations. LaRose, the indictment claims, stole a U.S. passport at one point in order to "facilitate an act of international terrorism." She received "a direct order to kill a citizen and resident of Sweden, and to do so in a way that would frighten 'the whole Kufar [non-believer] world.' " The indictment does not identify the Swedish resident, but a government official familiar with the case acknowledged that Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was the intended target. Justice Department officials declined to comment. "I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying," LaRose said via electronic communication, according to the indictment. LaRose, along with the co-conspirators, believed that "her appearance and American citizenship would help her blend in while carrying out her plans, calling it a possible "way to achieve what is in my heart," according to the indictment. The indictment alleges that LaRose even agreed to marry one of the co-conspirators to obtain residency status in a European country. LaRose traveled to Europe in August and "tracked the intended target online in an effort to complete her task," the statement said. According to the indictment, LaRose told the co-conspirator who ordered the murder that she considers it an "honour & a great pleasure to die or kill for" the co-conspirator and pledged that "only death will stop me here that I am so close to the target." The killing did not occur, and LaRose was arrested about two weeks after the electronic message was sent. Mark Wilson, a federal public defender representing LaRose, declined to comment on the case Tuesday. LaRose, according to the Justice Department, was born in 1963 and lives outside Philadelphia in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. CNN's Carol Cratty and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.
Inside a Mexican jail, Yanira Maldonado wept. A devout Mormon, the Arizona mother of seven said Wednesday she's been turning to scripture to survive ever since authorities falsely accused her of drug smuggling last week. "Reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting," Maldonado told CNN. "And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there reaching out to help." A judge is weighing whether to set Maldonado free after authorities accused her of drug smuggling and alleged they found 12 pounds of marijuana under her bus seat. Maldonado maintained her innocence Wednesday. "I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have," she said. "You know, we're not rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other people." The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado haven't made their case yet in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday, but didn't show, according to a defense attorney. Hearings in the case are set to continue Friday. Maldonado's family denies the charges and says they're optimistic the case against her is crumbling. "We have high hopes," Anna Soto, Maldonado's daughter, told CNN on Wednesday. "So I'm just looking forward to that. Hopefully, Friday, I'm praying that she will be home and be set free." It's a situation Maldonado said she never imagined when she boarded a bus last week to head back to the United States after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico. "I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else," she said. "And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did." Fearing for her life Earlier this week, Maldonado's cuffed hands gripped a metal bar as a truck carrying her to testify barreled down the street. One thought went through her mind, she told CNN, crying as she recalled her fear that the fast-moving Mexican police convoy would crash. "I'm not a killer. I'm not a criminal. I'm just here by mistake because people are not doing their work," she said. "This is not right. I need to be back with my family. I need to be out of here. I need help." Since her arrest, Maldonado said her views toward the country where she was born have changed drastically. Asked before by friends about going south of the border, Maldonado never thought twice when she gave advice. "I used to tell people, 'Come to Mexico. It's not true what they're saying. I go every year to visit my family. ... I come, I drive myself, nothing happens.' ... Look what's happening to me now. I cannot say that anymore," Maldonado told CNN. "I don't want anybody to go through this." If she's released from prison, Maldonado says she's not sure whether she'll ever return to Mexico. From a bus seat to a jail cell Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado last Wednesday as she and her husband, Gary, were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. Another daughter, Brenda Pedraza, called the arrest "outrageous." Her mother was recently by her side, she said, cradling her newborn granddaughter. "She's just a wonderful mom and a wonderful grandma and she would never jeopardize her life to lose this, to lose her family," she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. The family relies on Maldonado and misses her, Pedraza said. "I still need her, you know, being a new mom. I still need her advice, her guidance. We've heard that the minimum is 10 years. Ten years is a whole lifespan. We don't have that time, 10 years, to be separated," Pedraza said, choking back tears. "Please, to the officials in Mexico, please do your part and really investigate, because I know my mom has nothing to do with those illegal drugs." After testifying in court on Tuesday, Gary Maldonado told CNN affiliate KTVK that he was feeling optimistic. "We're hoping for the best outcome. ... We don't think they have a case," he said. The Mexican Embassy in Washington said in a statement that a preliminary decision from the judge was expected soon. Questions about arrest A Sonora state official with extensive knowledge of the case told CNN there are questions about the arrest. "Can you imagine?" asked the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and did not want to be named. "A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed." A regional office of Mexico's Defense Ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales while authorities decide her fate. The Sonora state division of the attorney general's office said the investigation is ongoing and declined to provide additional information. Her husband was told by authorities that regardless of his wife's guilt or innocence, he would have to pay $5,000 to secure her freedom, the family said. He was able to cobble together the money but then was told it was too late. His wife had been transferred to another jail. U.S. officials monitoring the case Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, is monitoring the case, his office said. The State Department has also been in touch with the family. "The U.S. Consulate in Nogales is monitoring the case closely," State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. "They are in regular contact with Ms. Maldonado and her family, and her legal counsel, and they're working to schedule another visit with her. The last time we were able to visit with her was May 24." The State Department estimates that several thousand U.S. citizens are arrested in Mexico each year. But it's unclear exactly how many U.S. citizens have been detained in Mexico, the State Department said. "We don't have the exact breakdown for Mexico, and the embassy would not have that information either," said Elizabeth A. Finan, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affiairs. "However, I can say millions of U.S. citizens travel to Mexico each year, and most have uneventful trips. Arrests happen every day, as you might expect with such a high volume of visitors." Some arrests go unreported to U.S. officials, and sometimes arrested individuals do not request consular assistance, Finan wrote in an e-mail to CNN. "Arrest cases are not uncommon in Mexico," she said, "and our consular officers work hard to assist all U.S. citizens who come to us for help."

For more than three months, Linda Smith has wondered how the man who police say was driving drunk and involved in a crash last year that killed her daughter could be pardoned for a previous felony drunken driving offense. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour has said he didn't know that retired IRS investigator Harry Bostick had been arrested for a DUI months after the state's parole board recommended that Barbour grant him a full pardon. (Police have determined that while Bostick was driving under the influence, he was not at fault for the accident) But e-mails recently obtained by CNN show that Barbour's office was aware of Bostick's October DUI arrest months before Barbour pardoned him along with more than 200 other convicted felons during his last days in office in January. "They knew it, and they didn't stop it," said Smith, referring to the pardon. "Why didn't they do something?" Smith spoke to CNN, overcome with emotion after reading the e-mails obtained through a public records request from Mississippi's Department of Archives and History. The e-mails show that Amanda Jones, the governor's chief counsel, and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann were told about the October car crash that killed Linda Smith's 18-year-old daughter, Charity Smith, just days after it happened. Read the e-mails (PDF) Jones and Hosemann were even urged by a lawyer in the firm that represented Bostick not to issue the pardon, according to the e-mails. It is not known whether anyone communicated this information to Barbour. His spokeswoman would not comment on the e-mails, citing an ongoing case on executive pardon power that is before the state Supreme Court. Barbour granted Bostick a full pardon in January for a felony drunken driving offense in March 2009. It was Bostick's third drunken driving arrest in a little more than year. The full pardon gave Bostick back the rights that were taken away as a felon, such as voting, but his two other DUI convictions remain on his record, according to the state attorney's office in Lafayette County. Bostick was still going through a court-mandated drug rehab program when he applied for a pardon last summer. On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of Bostick's application to Barbour, recommending a full pardon in a 3-2 vote. A week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Charity Smith attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck slammed into the side of her car. Charity Smith was killed, and her older sister suffered serious injuries. Bostick was jailed for violating his probation from his previous DUI cases. When he received the pardon in January, the convicted DUI felon still sat in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell, awaiting formal charges for his fourth drunken driving arrest. A police investigation found that Bostick was under the influence of alcohol while driving but has determined that he was not at fault for the accident, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Bostick has not been charged, and his case is expected to go before a grand jury, according to the state attorney's office. If he is charged and convicted for the DUI offense, he will avoid the possibility of a stiffer sentence because it will be treated as his third DUI offense, instead of his fourth. However, he could go back to being a felon, and losing the rights restored to him under the pardon, with a third conviction. Neither Bostick nor his lawyers have returned calls from CNN seeking comment. Bostick's case offers a close look into the pardon process and the friendships and ties that often intersect with the political world. High-profile friends of the former federal investigator's, including lawyers and former U.S. attorneys, wrote letters to Barbour touting what they called Bostick's genuine lifestyle change. The letters detail what friends described as Bostick's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a "freakish house fire" and his subsequent divorce, according to pardon and parole documents obtained by CNN. "Harry Bostick has led a tragic life. A life that has now been turned around by a grace that is bigger than him," wrote retired U.S. Attorney Jim Greenlee. "He can now be a positive factor in many lives." Another former federal prosecutor, Bob Whitwell, who is married to the sister of Greenlee's wife, also tried to help Bostick get his pardon. "Bostick is a friend. He was a very good agent and worked a lot of drug cases and money laundering cases for me," Whitwell told CNN. "He was an outstanding officer. I knew him as a friend." Whitwell, an attorney in the firm that has represented Bostick in his DUI cases, said he called Hosemann, his old law school friend, to help with the pardon, even though the secretary of state's office has no official authority to issue pardons. After the October crash that killed Charity Smith, Whitwell reached out to Hosemann in an October 11 e-mail, asking him to back off on the pardon. "You asked me if he was straight and I gave you my word yes. For this I give you my sincere apology. I had no idea he had messed up. Therefore. Hold up on helping him. All of us are in shock. Sorry," Whitwell wrote. He signed the letter, "Your friend bob." Hosemann forwarded this e-mail to Barbour's chief counsel, Amanda Jones. Her e-mail reply: "ok will do." It's not known whether Jones spoke to Barbour about this before he issued Bostick's pardon. She did not return calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Hosemann said he never discussed the matter directly with Barbour. Jones no longer works in the governor's office and is currently employed by the Mississippi law firm Butler Snow, the same firm that employs the former governor. Whitwell said the October e-mail was the last communication he had about Bostick's pardon. "I told Delbert that I wanted him to pull back that pardon. It must not have gotten to the governor if he got pardoned," he said. Barbour has repeatedly said that as a Christian, he believes in forgiveness and second chances. Wearing a pendant with her daughter's image emblazoned on it, Linda Smith said she sees the whole affair as the good ol' boy network at its worst. "All I think about is my child every day, but I do know that certain people had to know, and they didn't do anything," she said with tears in her eyes. "Haley Barbour had to have known. It's their job to tell him, so he had to have known," she said. "How do you do that?" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET. For the latest from AC360° click here.
Salah Mohammed Salih Al-Dhabi, Abdel Ghaib Ahmad Hakim, and Abdul Khaled Al-Baydani -- are slated to be sent to Georgia, in the Caucasus region at the border of Europe and Asia. The other two -- Hashim Bin Ali Bin Amor Sliti and Husayn Salim Muhammad Al-Mutari Yafai -- are scheduled to be transferred to Slovakia in Central Europe. Hakim was represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, which identified him as Abd Al Hakim Ghalib Ahmad Alhag. Alhag (Hakim), who is from Yemen, had been detained for more than 10 years and been cleared for release "for years," but his transfer was delayed "as the U.S. inexplicably opposed his release in court," the center charged. "The U.S. finally transferred him on the eve of new litigation by the Center for Constitutional Rights challenging his continued indefinite detention based on or because of his Yemeni citizenship. Such arbitrary detention violates U.S. and international law, including the Geneva Conventions, which the U.S. is obligated to uphold," the center said. Attorneys for the center praised Alhag's transfer out of Gitmo. "We are grateful to the Republic of Georgia for offering our client a new home where he can begin to rebuild his life after more than a decade in Guantanamo without charge or trial," the center said in a statement. Of the 143 men in Guantanamo, 84 are from Yemen, and 54 of them have been approved for transfer, the center said. Alhag's transfer makes him the first Yemeni to be released since 2010, the center said. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that detainees have a constitutional right to challenge their detention, and the following year, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within a year, which has been delayed due to difficulties in relocating the prisoners. Last May, the U.S. government transferred five detainees to Qatar in exchange for the Taliban's release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive for five years.
A man "angered" by Manchester United's defeat to Barcelona in the final of the Champions League killed four people when he drove a minibus into a crowd celebrating the Spanish side's victory, police in Nigeria have told CNN. Barcelona fans celebrate in the city's Las Ramblas thoroughfare early Thursday morning. Ten people were also injured in the incident in the town of Ogbo, where the driver was subsequently arrested, a Port Harcourt Police spokesperson said. "He was displaying his anger at his team losing the match. The driver had passed the crowd then made a U-turn and ran into them," spokesperson Rita Inomey-Abbey said. Both Manchester United and Barcelona have a large fan base across the African continent, with millions tuning in to watch European football on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, more than 100 people were arrested in Barcelona city center in the early hours of Thursday morning following the Catalan team's 2-0 victory in Rome in the final of Europe's top club competition. Police arrested 119 young people after violence flared at a special celebration party in Place de Catalunya near the Las Ramblas thoroughfare, while 238 people suffered minor injuries. City officials estimated the damage at up to 100,000 euros ($140,000) as the youths attacked police with bottles and damaged shops, parks and public utilities such as lamp-posts. The trouble took some of the gloss off the achievement of Barcelona, who became the first team to win the Champions League, Spanish League and Spanish Cup titles in one season. Manager Josep Guardiola led the club to glory in his first season in charge, ending a period of three years without a trophy.
Legendary and curmudgeonly TV commentator Andy Rooney offered his final remarks Sunday on the news show "60 Minutes," capping a career that has spanned more than six decades. In his final essay, delivered around 8:15 p.m., Rooney said, "This is a moment I have dreaded. "I wish I could do this forever. But I can't," he said. "But I'm not retiring. Writers don't retire, and I'll always be a writer." CBS announced Tuesday that the upcoming program, five days later, would be the last one for the 92-year-old award-winning writer, essayist and commentator. He has been with the network -- first as a writer for "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts" -- since 1949, and been part of the "60 Minutes" crew since 1978. "There's nobody like Andy, and there never will be. He'll hate hearing this, but he's an American original," CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager said in a release announcing Rooney's exit. The original essay offered Sunday was Rooney's 1,097th for the program. In it, he described himself simply, not as a "television personality," but rather as "a writer who reads what he's written." "A writer's job is to tell the truth," he said. "I know I've been terribly wrong sometimes, but I think I've been right more than I've been wrong." Earlier in the show, Morley Safer -- himself a 79-year-old journalist and a "60 Minutes" staple since 1970 -- interviewed Rooney about his personal and professional life. Rooney attended Colgate University until he was drafted into the Army in 1941. In February 1943, he was one of six correspondents who flew with the 8th Air Force on the first American bombing raid over Germany. Last year, Rooney received the Overseas Press Club of America President's Award for these reports. The television commentator admitted Sunday that he doesn't sign autographs and rarely responds to fan mail, telling Safer he didn't "want to answer an idiot who would have the bad sense to write me a letter." Rooney has also engendered controversy, such as his weekslong suspension in 1990 from "60 Minutes" for remarks that offended some gay viewers. But he's better known for his sharp commentaries and public persona as someone fed up with everything from desk clutter to chocolate chip cookies to door knobs. In his time at "60 Minutes," Rooney also has contributed many deeper pieces in the wake of events like the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the "shock and awe" campaign to start the 2003 Iraq war -- a phrase he scathingly said "makes us look like foolish braggarts." Safer described his longtime colleague as "America's favorite grouch-in-chief," saying Rooney used his "loud whiny voice ... speaking up for citizens fed up with everything." "There have been many curmudgeons on television over its long history," Safer said affectionately. "None has been so long serving in that role as Mr. Rooney."
China has refused nine U.S. Navy ships and one Air Force jet entry to Hong Kong in the past month, U.S. military officials said Friday. China has refused the USS Reuben James, seen in a 1989 photo, a Christmas port call in Hong Kong. Senior Navy officials said that Beijing denied permission for the USS Reuben James, a Navy frigate, to make a holiday port call for sailors at the end of December. The rejection occurred last week, at the same time China refused to allow the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier battle group into Hong Kong for a Thanksgiving holiday port call. A U.S. Air Force C-17 flight that had been scheduled for a routine resupply of the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong also was denied permission to enter, Navy officials said. The Kitty Hawk battle group was eventually granted permission to enter, but by then the ships were well on their way to port in Japan. Days earlier, China refused to give two U.S. Navy minesweepers safe harbor in Hong Kong during a storm on the high seas. The United States has filed a formal protest with China over the decisions. U.S. officials are baffled about the reason or reasons for the port call refusals. China recently has expressed concerns about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and President Bush's October presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.  Watch China put the blame on the U.S. » There is speculation that the Chinese may have been conducting military exercises that they didn't want the U.S. Navy to see. Others think the refusals may have been the result of a misunderstanding. Officials could not explain why the rejection of the Reuben James had not been disclosed before, even though reporters had repeatedly asked if there were any other pending port calls. One senior Navy official expressed dismay that the information had not been made public by the Pentagon. White House deputy spokesman Scott Stanzel told reporters the White House is "aware" of the latest refusals and referred reporters to the Pentagon. Stanzel said a "clarification" on the matter was being sought from Beijing. White House and other Bush administration officials have sought to defuse tensions with China, saying the United States wants to move ahead on broader issues of military cooperation. Navy officials, meanwhile, say Japan is tightening approvals for Chinese navy visits into its ports. Crew members from a Chinese ship making a port call in Japan may not be allowed to tour a Japanese Aegis warship. The U.S.-designed Aegis weapons system enables coordinated operations against threats from aircraft and missiles, surface ships and submarines. It is not clear if the Japanese decision was made at the request of the United States. E-mail to a friend
A Thai judge fined dozens of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of illegal entry after escaping from their own country a month ago -- amid allegations that other Rohingya have been dumped at sea by the Thai army. Male refugees show scars they say were caused by beatings at the hands of the Myanmar navy. The Ranong Provincial Court judge ordered each of the 66 ethnic Muslim refugees to pay 1,000 Thai baht (less than $30). He imposed the fines via a closed-circuit television link to Ranong Provincial Prison, where the refugees will continue to be held until they can pay the court. Twelve additional refugees, all teenagers, were being detained at a police station and are exempt from prosecution. The 78 refugees will be handed over on January 31 to immigration police, who will deport them. It is unclear where they will be sent. The refugees arrived by boat on the Thai shore, and Thai police said many had severe burns from a fire that broke out on board their craft after it left neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma. Members of Myanmar's Rohingya minority have been fleeing the country for years, saying they are persecuted by its military government. One refugee, who called himself Mohamed, told CNN that their boat had been at sea for a month, and that Myanmar's military had detained and attacked them before setting their boat on fire. The refugees are unwelcome in Thailand, where authorities say about 20,000 have settled illegally. Other boatloads of Rohingya have allegedly been set adrift after being towed out to sea by Thai authorities. A recent CNN investigation found evidence of such activity. Photos obtained by CNN include one that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees.  Watch Dan Rivers' BackStory on the investigation » CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few who had survived after a group of six rickety boats was towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities earlier this month. The Thai government has launched an inquiry. The Thai army has denied the allegations. But after extensive questioning by CNN, one source in the Thai military confirmed that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. The source defended it, saying that each boatload of refugees is given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source said Thai villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and they had accused the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. The Thai government has said that "there is no reasonable ground to believe" that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar because of persecution. "Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants, and not those requiring international protection," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Tuesday. One of the refugees who came ashore Tuesday said they will be killed if returned to Myanmar because of their minority status. He said the Rohingya are stateless because they lack bribe money to obtain identification cards in Myanmar. In Tuesday's statement, the Thai government said it deals with all illegal migrants in accordance with its laws and international guidelines. It said "basic humanitarian needs" such as food and water are met among the migrants before they are returned home. Their boats also are fixed, officials said. The Thai government said that "accepting those arriving in an irregular manner would simply encourage new arrivals." The government denied media reports alleging that Thai authorities mistreat the illegal migrants and intentionally damage their boats. CNN's Dan Rivers and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.
A federal judge sentenced an Illinois man to two and a half years in prison Monday for taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude. The taping took place through a hotel-room peephole, and the video was posted on the Internet. Michael David Barrett, 49, pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in December after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of Andrews while she was nude. According to a plea deal, prosecutors and Barrett had agreed to a 27-month prison sentence. But Andrews called him a sexual predator and  argued in court for him to be sentenced for as long as the law allowed, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. "I would have liked longer time, but I know that the judge obviously did the best he could with the parameters that are set," Andrews told reporters outside the courthouse after the sentencing. "But I'm glad he'll be away from anyone that he could harm for the next 30 months." In court papers, prosecutors stated that Barrett -- an insurance company employee from Westmont, Illinois -- posted as many as 10 videos of Andrews to the Internet. Also in court papers, prosecutors said Barrett had posted videos of another 16 as-yet-unidentified victims to the Internet. Barrett has been free on bail and has been ordered to report to prison May 3, said Tom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. In a statement issued through his attorney when the plea agreement was announced, Barrett expressed "deep regret" to Andrews "for his conduct that caused her so much pain." Authorities believe that most of the videos were made at a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, in September 2008. The peephole into Andrews' room was altered with a hacksaw, and the images appeared to have been taken with a cell phone camera, according to the charges against Barrett. Andrews travels across the country covering college football games for ESPN. According to charges prosecutors filed against Barrett in October, she said that she became aware of the videos in July and that their posting caused her distress, anxiety and trouble sleeping. Barrett came under scrutiny after attempting to sell the videos to the celebrity gossip site TMZ in January 2009. TMZ did not purchase the images, but employees of the Web site assisted in the investigation by providing information to Andrews' attorneys, authorities said. TMZ, like CNN, is a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. CNN's Lynn Lamanivong contributed to this report.
Patrycja Makowska likes to give enigmatic names to the extraordinarily beautiful photographs she shoots of crumbling palaces. But that's not where the enigma of her work ends. Despite creating alluring images of abandoned buildings, she's determined to keep their locations a mystery. "Places reflect our soul, tell the forgotten story of love, disaster, war, as well as ordinary life," Makowska, a former history teacher from Poland, tells CNN as she tries to explain her shroud of secrecy. "Everything passes, even the power of past times is often forgotten. And that's why I don't give any addresses, because often these places are destroyed and devastated, it's better for them to have been forgotten." Not, however, forgotten by Makowska's cameras. She uses old analog Russian photo equipment and lenses, plus some more modern Canon and Nikon equipment to create images that pay homage to the original grandeur of these baroque structures. With otherworldly titles such as "Ethereal Dreams" and "Lost Under the Surface," her photographs have an unrealistic quality more closely associated with paintings -- but the incredible detail on display would take more than a lifetime's worth of brushstrokes to recreate. Swirling spiral staircases The images show vast ornate ballrooms, swirling spiral staircases and elegant chapels strewn with rubble. Sunlight shafts bore in through broken windows or holes in roofs. Sometimes an abandoned toy or chair adds a poignant human touch to the dereliction. Makowska, who lives in Warsaw, took up photography about 12 years ago. Her first subject was a ruined medieval castle in the southern Polish town of Muszyna. During stays in the UK and Iceland she says she realized there was "magic" in forgotten places and began seeking them out in her home country. Finding her subjects takes effort, she says. "The location of these places is hard work, the research involves maps, historical books and old guides, and talking to people who live in the areas of the buildings." Her refusal to identify where these buildings will at least prevent them from becoming "ruin porn" destinations -- a status deplored by some places trying shake off economic decline. Makowska, who now works in IT, says she has been inspired by people's reactions to her work into pursuing further projects. On her list is nature photography -- "mountains, meadows and sea" -- and documenting "URBEX," the sometimes risky global trend of urban exploration that occasionally involves trespassing on dangerous structures. She also wants to tackle human subjects. "This would be a breakthrough for me because so far my work hasn't involved any people or portraits."
The first U.S. case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has been reported in Indiana, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The patient is a health-care provider who recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to provide health care, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The person, an American male, traveled on April 24 from Riyadh to London, then to Chicago, and took a bus to Indiana, officials said. He began experiencing shortness of breath, coughing, and fever on April 27, according to the Indiana State Department of Health. The patient was admitted to Community Hospital in Munster, Indiana, on April 28, the same day he visited the emergency department there, the health department said. He has been isolated and is in stable condition. He is receiving oxygen support, but does not require a ventilator, Schuchat said. MERS: 5 things to know The virus poses a "very low risk to the broader general public," Schuchat said, as it has not been shown to spread easily from person to person. The CDC and the Indiana State Department of Health are conducting a joint investigation into the case, according to a CDC statement. The CDC confirmed Indiana test results on Friday. "The CDC, IDPH (Illinois Department of Public Health) and CDPH (Chicago Department of Public Health) do not consider passengers on the flight or bus to be close contacts of the patient and therefore are not at high risk," said Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, director of the IDPH. Passengers on the same plane and bus as the patient will be contacted by the CDC as a precautionary measure, starting Saturday, the Illinois statement said. If the CDC identifies ill individuals with possible MERS-CoV, it will notify health officials in Chicago and Indiana. "There is no reason to suspect any current risk to travelers or employees at O'Hare Airport at this time," said CDPH commissioner Bechara Choucair. The coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, was first reported in the Middle East -- specifically, the Arabian Peninsula -- in 2012. Laboratory testing has confirmed 262 cases of the coronavirus in 12 countries, including the Indiana case, Schuchat said. Ninety-three people have died. So far, all MERS cases have been linked to six countries on or near the Arabian Peninsula, Schuchat said. The Saudi Ministry of Health has reported 339 cases, and said nearly a third of those have died. Not all of the Saudi cases have been confirmed by the World Health Organization. "The MERS virus is of grave concern because of the virulence," Schuchat said. But, she added, "We're not yet aware of confirmed sustained community transmission." Late last month, Saudi officials noted a spike in new cases. The CDC has expected MERS to come to the United States, Schuchat said. "We have been preparing for this." However, "The introduction of MERS-CoV is another reminder that diseases are just a plane ride away," she said. Opinion: Why MERS virus is so scary MERS-CoV comes from the same group of viruses as the common cold and attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath, can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. The CDC has issued general precautions such as frequent hand-washing, avoiding close contact with infected people, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched. Pediatricians should ask about where young patients with high fever and respiratory symptoms have traveled, Schuchat said. "Young children often have fever and respiratory symptoms, but the key here is: Was there a history of travel within the past 14 days to the Arabian Peninsula, or contact with someone? ... They should alert their clinician about that travel or contact," Schuchat said. Currently, the CDC does not recommend changing travel plans because of the virus, Schuchat said. No one knows exactly how this virus originated, but evidence is emerging implicating camels. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. The same group of researchers reported in February that nearly three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past exposure to the MERS coronavirus. MERS mystery: Virus found in camels Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in European countries and Tunisia in North Africa. Egypt reported its first case on April 26, according to the WHO. Limited human-to-human transmission of the disease has also occurred in other countries -- meaning some people who traveled to the Middle East gave the virus to others. Officials are not aware of any other confirmed U.S. cases, Schuchat said, adding it's too early to assume no one else is ill. An active investigation is underway. CNN's Miriam Falco, Caleb Hellerman and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.
(CNN)At the rate Marvel is going, all of its comic book characters will have their own movie, maybe two. "Ant-Man" is the latest to join the studio's movie superhero ranks. Marvel just unveiled the trailer this week. The character is little-known outside of hardcore fans, much like last summer's "Guardians of the Galaxy" franchise, which turned out to be a big hit. Playing Ant-Man is Paul Rudd, an actor largely known for his comedic chops. Rudd's character, the troubled Scott Lang, is recruited by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), to wear the shrinking Ant-Man suit. A keen sense of humor might be just what's needed for this superhero, who becomes teeny tiny, but powerful, in his pursuit of justice. However, unlike "Guardians," reaction to the trailer from social media was decidedly mixed. "Ant-Man" hits theaters on July 17.
It started off as a letter, but for former Marine Joshua Boston it was more than that. It was about his freedom. The Afghanistan veteran wrote an open letter to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, saying that he would not register his weapons with the government even if a ban on assault weapons is passed. The letter started on CNN iReport and gained mass attention online, obtaining a quarter-million views as of Friday evening and appearing on several other news outlets. Boston said he was inspired to send in the iReport because he felt as though some gun owners were being unfairly targeted. He is angered by "the fact that I'm supposed to be punished for doing nothing more than owning a rifle that looks scary because its stock isn't made out of wood," he said. Feinstein has said she plans to introduce a bill in January that would place a ban on assault weapons. Gun rights legislation gained renewed attention after an armed gunman killed 20 children and six adults in the Newtown school shooting. The bill aims to revisit a 1994 ban that expired in 2004. The prohibition did not eliminate assault weapons, but restricted their features, limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds and regulating pistol grips, bayonet attachments and flash suppressors. Politics: Gun owners fear new legislation could tread on their rights Boston said he served in Afghanistan twice and Iraq twice between 2004 and 2011. Although no longer serving in the military, the 26-year-old said he still owns guns and believes the government does not need to know what guns he owns; he believes weapons registration would lead to confiscation. Many of the people who posted the more than 1,400 passionate comments about the letter said they agreed with Boston. Both pro- and anti-gun supporters weighed in on the idea of registering weapons in the United States and the use of assault weapons. "I, like you am a former Marine corporal and I support you 110%," wrote CNN iReport user TMuttDaddy. "It's nobody's business how many guns I own. I also support restoring the gun ownership right for felons. Provided the crime was nonviolent and not repeat offenders. I do think we need to address how firearms are stored and secured. We need to require owners to secure their weapons in such a way that makes them difficult to steal. I suggest gun safes and trigger locks. We need to do all we can to keep guns off the street." iReport: Why would someone own a military-style rifle? Str8shot wrote, "This is absolutely the best response to the attack on civilian gun ownership that I've seen in some time." "I'd stand, proudly, with this man in preserving our rights. He clearly understood his pledge to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic and sounds like he'll do it. I'm right there with him!" Despite the number of mass shootings in the United States in 2012, Boston said he believes the laws already set in place for gun control are plenty. He adds that more laws will simply remove a means of defense for people. "I own the guns I own because I acknowledge mankind's shortcomings instead of pretending like they don't exist," Boston wrote. "There are evil men in this world and there just may be a time when I need to do the unthinkable to protect me or my family." But many commenters disagreed with Boston's take. "I respect gun usage to a point when they are use (sic) with respect and with common sense," wrote iReporter RindaLynn. "Guns do not save people. People choosing not to use guns save people," RindaLynn added. Opinion: Case for gun rights is stronger than you think YankCT highlighted the value of Boston's military contributions even while disagreeing with his views. "Ms. Feinstein is an elected official who was selected by voters to represent their interests in a governing body," YankCT wrote. "She has the authority and responsibility to do just that until the people whom she represents decide otherwise through their votes. This gentleman believes that he is above the law. This is untrue; in fact, my guess is that he swore to defend the country and respect its laws when he entered the Marines." At points in his letter, Boston addresses the senator directly: "I am not your subject," he writes. "I am the man who keeps you free. I am not your servant. I am the person whom you serve. I am not your peasant." In response to Boston's letter, Feinstein released this statement: "Senator Feinstein respects Cpl. Boston's service. She has heard from thousands of people -- including many gun owners -- who support her plan to stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons and large capacity magazines, strips and drums that hold more than 10 rounds. Â As Senator Feinstein has said, the legislation will be carefully focused to protect the rights of existing gun owners by exempting hundreds of weapons used for hunting and sporting purposes." A reader called freddieman said he was inspired to send his own senators a message. He said he is a veteran and comes from a military family. "I will not lose my rights because those who do not follow the laws and freedoms of this land choose not to follow," he said.

 about 50 miles from where the Pope was in Tacloban. Just two weeks ago, a tropical storm struck Tacloban and surrounding areas, causing a commercial passenger plane to slide off the runway while landing. Tropical Storm Jiangmi, renamed Seniang in the Philippines, killed 54 people in landslides and flash floods in that region, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. During the Pope's visit to Tacloban, he will have lunch with survivors of the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, renamed Typhoon Yolanda in that country. That typhoon displaced 918,000 families nationwide, the government says. He is also to bless the Pope Francis Center for the Poor and will meet with clergy and more typhoon survivors in the cathedral in Palo. The pontiff is also scheduled to perform an outdoor Mass in Manila on Sunday before millions of Filipinos. By then, the storm should weaken to a tropical depression. Still, Manila could face gusty winds and significant rain during the Mass. The Pope's trip to Asian isles began Tuesday in Sri Lanka, and he landed in the Philippines on Friday. On Friday, Francis met with President Benigno Aquino, and the pontiff urged the political leader to reject corruption and promote "honesty, integrity and commitment to the common good," the Vatican said. He also spoke of "the moral imperative of ensuring social justice and respect for human dignity," according to a copy of his remarks provided by the Vatican. "Here in the Philippines, countless families are still suffering from the effects of natural disasters. The economic situation has caused families to be separated by migration and the search for employment, and financial problems strain many households. While all too many people live in dire poverty, others are caught up in materialism and lifestyles which are destructive of family life and the most basic demands of Christian morality," the Pope said in other remarks. The Pope leaves Manila for Rome on Monday.
Bob Dylan never wrote any songs about body glitter or throwing up in the closet. So one may wonder why Ke$ha appears on Amnesty International's new benefit disc "Chimes of Freedom," a 76-track collection of Dylan covers that also features Adele (''Make You Feel My Love''), Maroon 5 (''I Shall Be Released''), and yes, Miley Cyrus (''You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go''), among others. But on her stripped-down ''Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,'' Ke$ha gets the song's heartbreak right; you can actually hear her sobbing between verses. If there's ever a reason to believe the girl's capable of deeper feelings than ''vaguely hungover,'' this is it. To quote from the 1964 Dylan song that gives this comp its name, Bob has always been a champion of ''the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones, an' worse.'' So it makes sense that the best covers here come from the misfits (Ke$ha), the punks (check out Rise Against's raging ''Ballad of Hollis Brown''), the outsiders (Mexican pop star Ximena SariÃ±ana's excellent ''I Want You''), and the radicals (''With God on Our Side'' finds Somali-born Toronto rapper K'naan challenging American hawkishness as only a Canadian can). Aretha Franklin calls off engagement The savviest musicians here flip Dylan's messages for their own aims, just as Dylan reappropriated protest songs by civil rights heroes. Celtic-rock stalwarts Flogging Molly take on ''The Times They Are A-Changin' '' -- which itself was inspired by Irish drinking songs -- and reclaim it for Dublin. SinÃ©ad O'Connor recasts 1981's born-again ''Property of Jesus'' as a fiery church-reform anthem. And Carly Simon smartly plays ''Just Like a Woman'' as a feminist ballad. When she sings ''You break just like a little girl,'' it sounds like she's telling Dylan to man up. There's just one problem. That leaves 60-something more songs, and an unholy amount of strummy-strummy-strum (though you can buy digital tracks individually, and an edited two-disc version is available for $14.95 at Starbucks). Diana Krall, Billy Bragg, Pete Townshend, and other major talents opt for straight, folky readings of songs that beg for a reggaeton arrangement or a brostep remix -- anything to update the same classics we've heard a bajillion times before. True, Ziggy Marley and Michael Franti bring some freshness, but even they can't resist those bland open-mic-at-the-fair-trade-coffee-shop guitars. Where's the prankster spirit that got Dylan booed at Newport? Apologies to Brett Dennen and Dierks Bentley, whose respective rootsy spins on ''You Ain't Goin' Nowhere'' and ''SeÃ±or'' are lovely, but after listening to your trillionth fingerpicking solo, it's easy to think, ''Dylan went electric for this?'' Tracy Morgan taken to hospital in Utah By contrast, Kronos Quartet and Philip Glass sound almost revolutionary on their gorgeous, avant-classical ''Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,'' the only song that appears twice here. It takes major innovation (and some musical-saw interludes) to create a wholly original take on an artist who reinvents his own songs every time he plays live. And maybe that's why covering Dylan seems so hard: At a time when every subway busker thinks he's the Bard, the only man who's really the ''new Bob Dylan'' is Dylan himself.

At 4:54 pm ET on Wednesday, someone downloaded the 50 billionth app from Apple's online App Store. Apple will give the lucky downloader a $10,000 iTunes gift card. The next 50 people to download an app after that will each receive a $500 gift card. There was no immediate word from Apple on who won. Apple had a live countdown ticker on its iTunes Web page. The promotion is yet another reminder of the massive success of Apple's App Store, which opened in 2008, added to the appeal of the iPhone and spawned many bad "there's an app for that" headlines. It also inspired online app stores by Google, BlackBerry and other companies. The contest was open to entrants 13 or older in a country where the App Store is available. People also could enter without downloading an app by filling out an online form. This marks the second time in three months that Apple has celebrated an iTunes milestone. In February, Phillip Lupke of Germany received a 10,000 euro (about $13,528) iTunes gift card for downloading the 25 billionth song. How massive a number is 50 billion? According to Apple, counting to 50 billion would take a person 1,600 years.
CNN has learned from two senior Democratic sources that former President Bill Clinton will attend the Senate Democrats' weekly luncheon Tuesday to address the caucus about health care. A notice obtained by CNN went out to Senate Democrats saying, "All Senators should be aware that former President Clinton will be making a presentation on Health Care at tomorrow's caucus lunch. Senator Reid has requested that all Democratic Senators attend." A constant refrain from Democratic leaders is that wavering Democrats must heed what they say is a lesson of the Clinton administration: fail to pass a health care reform bill, and congressional Democrats will suffer on Election Day. With this visit at a critical time for health care in the Senate, the former president will be able to deliver that message in person. Democrats in the House of Representatives approved a health care bill over the weekend. If the Senate passes a bill, a congressional conference committee will need to merge the House and Senate proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to President Obama's desk to be signed into law. The House bill is more expansive -- and hence more expensive -- than the Senate Finance Committee bill. The House bill, projected to guarantee coverage for 96 percent of Americans, will cost more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. CNN's Dana Bash, Brianna Keilar,Ted Barrett and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.
Players and ball boys fainting and accusations of "inhumane" treatment. If it's hot on court -- temperatures of 42.2 Celsius (108 Fahrenheit) were recorded Tuesday -- at the Australia Open, the mercury is also rising for tournament officials at Melbourne Park. Canadian Frank Dancevic fainted during his match with Frenchman Benoit Paire, before he got really hot under the collar over the conditions players had to contend with at the first tennis grand slam of 2014. "I think it's inhumane, I don't think it's fair to anybody, to the players, to the fans, to the sport, when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out," the world No. 122 told reporters. "I've played five set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat-stroke, it's not normal. "Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it's too hot to play, until somebody dies, they're just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. "I personally don't think it's fair and I know a lot of players don't think it's fair." It wasn't just players who succumbed to the elements. One of the ball boys fainted during 11th seed Milos Raonic's four-set defeat of Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver. "Of course there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match," chief medical officer Tim Wood told reporters, as organizers defended the decision to play in the heat. Caution urged But with temperatures above 40 Celsius expected for most of the week, Briton Andy Murray urged caution. "Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. You've just got to be very careful these days," he said. "There's been some issues in other sports with, you know, players having heart attacks." In the women's draw, Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki claimed the weather caused her drinks bottle to melt on court while second seed Victoria Azarenka described playing at the Rod Laver Arena as like "dancing in a frying pan." The tournament's "extreme heat" contingency was introduced for matches in the women's draw, allowing for an extended break between the second and third sets. Rather than solely using a temperature reading, organizers use a measurement which also considers humidity and wind to decide whether or not conditions have become unplayable. "We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time," tournament referee Wayne McKewen said in a statement. "That didn't happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue." While some players wilted, Roger Federer was typically unflappable in the stifling heat. "Just deal with it, because it's the same for both (players)," said the 17-time grand slam winner, seeded sixth, after defeating spirited Australian James Duckworth 6-4 6-4 6-2. When asked if he thought organizers should close the retractable roof over the Rod Laver Arena to help lower the temperature on court, the 32-year-old Federer, who last won one of tennis' four majors at Wimbledon in 2012, replied: "No. I think it should always stay open, honestly." World No. 1 Rafael Nadal played in the last match to get under way in the Rod Laver Arena against Australian Bernard Tomic. Thirteen-time grand slam winner Nadal took the first set 6-4 before the 57th-ranked Tomic retired with a leg injury. Nadal will play Tomic's compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis in the second round. Murray made a strong start in his bid to finally capture Melbourne glory, beating Japan's Go Soeda 6-1 6-1 6-3. The world No. 4 has been runner-up at the season's first grand slam in three of the last four years, but enters this tournament short of match practice after undergoing back surgery. However the Scot looked sharp, taking just 87 minutes to dispatch his 112th-ranked opponent in punishing heat and set up a second round meeting with Frenchman Vincent Millot. U.S. No. 1 John Isner's tournament is over after he was forced to withdraw from his match with Slovakia's Martin Klizan due to a foot injury. Isner, the only American male seeded in the draw, has been battling ankle and shin problems during the offseason. The 28-year-old missed last year's tournament with a knee injury. Another American to fall at the first hurdle was Rhyne Williams who, despite winning the opening set, suffered a battling 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 6-4 6-4 loss against fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro. Argentina's Del Potro is looking to build on an encouraging 2013 season which saw him reach the last four of a grand slam, at Wimbledon, for the first time since 2009. But Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, struggled with intense heat. "You are thinking about a lot more things than the tennis match," said the 25-year-old, who plays Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut next. "You are trying to drink a lot and always thinking about your body, your physic, and not about the game. "I know tomorrow and after tomorrow it's going to be worst, so I will try to be ready for the weather conditions, too." Empty seats were prevalent as many fans stayed away in heat, but those that did go to Melbourne Park were treated to a gutsy performance from Australian stalwart Lleyton Hewitt in his five-set battle with 24th seed Andrea Seppi. The Italian took a two-set lead before former world No. 1 Hewitt rallied to draw level. To the disappointment most of those in the Rod Laver Arena, though, Hewitt's comeback was thwarted and Italy's Seppi eventually triumphed 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 5-7 5-7 7-5. Tenth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, beaten in the quarterfinals in 2013, beat Seppi's compatriot Filippo Volandri in straight sets.
Divers in Maine were scouring a river Wednesday in their search for a missing 21-month-old girl, but had found no sign of her in the frigid waters, authorities said. "We're making progress. I can tell you honestly that as the days go on, our concern grows, as it's been 26 days. But I can also tell you that we remain hopeful that we will bring her back to her home," Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland told reporters. The search for Ayla Reynolds focused Wednesday on a half-mile area of the Kennebec River that stretches from downtown Waterville to the Carter Memorial Bridge. Officials said they had received more than 600 tips, but nothing that specifically pointed to that area. The river still has open water despite air temperatures in the teens. Divers in special suits to protect them in the frigid waters rotated in and out of the river, which was around freezing temperature, Maine Warden Service Lt. Kevin Adam said. "The water is clear. When the sun is out, they can see 4-6 feet. ... We picked today because the weather's good and it was the most efficient time to do it," he said. The search for the little girl is in its fourth week. Police have said they suspect foul play in the case. "All we know is that Ayla's missing. We've ruled out no scenario. We've ruled out no one. And we're not going to get into investigative details," McCausland said Wednesday. He described the search as the most intense investigation Maine's state police had been involved in for two decades. Ayla's parents are not married and don't live together. Her mother recently completed rehab, family members said. Investigators said both families have cooperated with police. The little girl's father, Justin DiPietro, said he put his daughter to bed at 8 p.m. December 16 and called police the next morning just before 9 a.m. to report her missing, according to authorities. DiPietro's mother, Phoebe DiPietro, told CNN she wasn't at the home the night Ayla disappeared. But she said she fully supports her son, who has said he "would never do anything to harm" his daughter. She said she just wants her Ayla returned unharmed. "I'd give everything I owned if we can have her back," she said last week, her voice breaking. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.
A federal judge determined Wednesday that Shannon Richardson, an actress accused of sending ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is a "flight risk" and thus must remain behind bars. The Texas woman, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, was arrested in June. She was ordered to undergo a mental evaluation, and late last month, she was found competent to stand trial. The actress has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Richardson was in a federal court in Texarkana, Texas, for a roughly 30-minute detention hearing Wednesday morning. According to a court document, her lawyer and prosecutors both presented their arguments as to why she should be allowed to go free on bail or, conversely, why she should remain in custody. Judge Caroline Craven concluded that, although Richardson probably isn't "a danger to the community," she is "a serious flight risk, and no conditions will ensure her appearance." As a result, Craven ordered the 35-year-old to remain detained pending her trial. Three envelopes containing the natural, highly toxic compound derived from castor beans were mailed from Shreveport, Louisiana, in May. They were discovered, before causing any injuries or fatalities, with what the FBI described as "very low concentrations" of ricin. What is ricin? Richardson -- who has had minor roles in television series including "The Walking Dead" and "The Vampire Diaries" -- initially told FBI agents that her now-estranged husband Nathaniel had sent the ricin-tainted letters. But, authorities have said, Richardson was found to be "deceptive" in a polygraph exam. Investigators found that her computer storage devices contained the text of threatening letters sent to the president. But the couple's computer records show that her husband couldn't have printed them out because he was at work at the time, according to an FBI arrest affidavit. Eventually, Richardson admitted to investigators that she'd mailed the letters, though she claimed her husband had typed them out and forced her to print and mail them, the affidavit said. Actress first accuses husband, then is arrested in ricin case Nathaniel Richardson denied doing any such thing, telling investigators that his wife was "intentionally misleading" them and that she'd wanted to end their marriage and leave them, court papers said. He filed for divorce in June, and court papers indicated that Shannon Richardson was pregnant.
Fans of China's outspoken artist Ai Weiwei are not shy when it comes to posing nude. The nude photos are part of an effort by Ai fans to show their support for the controversial artist who says he's being investigated on porn charges. The latest allegations come after Ai was slapped with tax evasion charges, which he says is punishment for his outspoken criticism of the Chinese government. Beginning this month, thousands of Ai supporters have donated money to help him pay an estimated 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) fine that the Beijing tax bureau says his design company Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd. owes in back taxes. Ai paid $1.3 million last week to prevent his wife, who runs the company, from going to jail and to appeal the charges. Only moral victory possible against China, dissident says Supporters donated an estimated 9 million yuan to help him pay the fines and now they're lending their bodies by posting photos online. More than 100 online supporters from around the world have posted images of themselves in nude poses -- a nod to a photo of Ai titled "One Tiger, Eight Breasts" taken last year with four women -- all of them nude. As a result, Ai says he is under investigation on porn charges. The photo tactic has grown so quickly that a new website has surfaced featuring posts by fans with the slogan, "Listen, Chinese Government: Nudity is not Pornography. On blogger writes, "Don't be afraid to bare all! The body is beautiful!" Another one says, "I love my body and freedom." Photos run the creative gamut from racy shower scenes to just breasts or buttocks. Others hide their private parts with photos of Ai, pose like famous statues by Rodin, display their middle fingers to the camera while covering their faces or even pose while on the toilet. Despite the support, Ai says he is not optimistic when it comes to his tax charges and says he doesn't believe in justice from the government since his detention for 81 days in April.
The days are getting shorter, the nights colder, but that doesn't mean that your electricity bill needs to go through the roof. In a unique experiment, the residents of Britain's Scilly Isles are hoping to show that reducing your electricity consumption doesn't have to be difficult. The Isles of Scilly is switching off power to promote energy efficiency. As part of E-Day, homes, schools and businesses on the Scilly Isles are switching off all non-essential electrical equipment to promote energy saving. The results of the experiment are being posted online in real-time. E-Day organizer, Matt Prescott said: "The Isles of Scilly are like a miner's canary for the rest of the UK, because of their vulnerability to sea level rise, to violent storms rolling off the Atlantic and to any major changes in the Gulf Stream." The islands, which lie 28 miles off Land's End, the UK's most westerly point, are connected to the UK mainland by a single electricity cable which means that power usage in the experiment can be measured efficiently. All of the 2000-strong community who are spread across five islands have been encouraged to join in. The energy savings made will be compared against the previous day's usage with updates appearing online regularly. The E-Day Web site keeps track of costs and kWh usage providing up-to-the-minute information about how much electricity is being used in island-wide as well as individually monitoring Five Islands School on St Mary's Island and the electricity consumption of one family. "We've fitted the family and the school with special energy monitors so they can accurately monitor what appliances use the most electricity," Prescott told CNN. Studies suggest that families who use these sorts of energy monitors can cut their electricity bills by up to 20 percent. At the time of writing, the family's consumption had dropped dramatically, down 35 percent on the previous day, which Prescott estimates is a saving of around £300 ($475) on their annual electricity bill. Sadly the figures for the school and the island as a whole weren't quite so impressive. The school was up six percent on the previous day, while the island as a whole saw a two percent rise in usage. Prescott put these small rises down to the notoriously fickle British weather. "Yesterday was lovely and sunny," he said. "So far, today it has been rainy." The damp and gloom have meant more lights being switched on but despite these meteorological setbacks, Prescott remained upbeat about the success of the experiment. "Before the family left home this morning they turned off everything they could, so their reduction in usage is a fantastic result," he said. Visitors to the the E-Day Web site can also play the"5 Things" game to find out what all sorts of household appliances cost to run and how much they cost you and the environment. "The E-Day experiment will hopefully prove that the small things can make a big difference, especially when we work together and try to save energy," Prescott said. Prescott is also the founder of "Ban the Bulb" -- an energy efficiency campaign which is helping phase out the use of incandescent light bulbs in 30 countries. The event has been organized as part of a four-day Earth Summit event which has seen the Isles of Scilly play host to fellow islanders from Samoa, The Galapagos Islands, Madagascar and the Carteret Islands -- whose inhabitants are some of the first people being displaced by rising sea-levels.
including China, Russia and Cuba -- said the measure was politically manipulated and would set a precedent for other nations to be targeted in the future. A North Korea representative told the U.N. gathering Tuesday that the resolution "provoked confrontation" and "failed to reflect the reality on the ground." China is likely to use its veto as its officials have repeatedly said efforts to send North Korea's leadership to the ICC "won't help improve a country's human rights condition." North Korea's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for Pyongyang. North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence and mass starvation to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens. North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country. North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' The country has accused the United States and its allies of seeking to discredit and overthrow the leadership in North Korea. In May, Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have asked the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes in Syria. They were the only two of 15 countries to vote against the resolution. The U.S. backs the resolution to sanction and refer North Korea to the ICC. Opinion: Stop romancing North Korea North Korea last week released the last remaining Americans -- Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller -- detained in the country, but the gesture has not altered the United State's stance on the country's human rights record. In February, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a 400-page report documenting widespread torture and abuse, and called for urgent action, including the referral of its findings to the ICC for possible prosecution. Kim Jong Il's former bodyguard tells of beatings, starvation in prison camp The almost yearlong investigation by the commission involved more than 320 witnesses in public hearings and private interviews. It listed a litany of abuses including a new mother being forced to drown her newborn, corpses being eaten by dogs and rampant beatings. North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, So Se Pyong, said the United States and "other hostile forces" had fabricated the report in an attempt to "defame the dignified image of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and eventually eliminate its social system." Before Tuesday's vote, an amendment proposed by Cuba to delete the language about an ICC referral was rejected 77-40, with 50 abstentions. Cuban Ambassador Rodolfo Reyes Rodriguez said U.N. resolutions targeting North Korea or any other single country were a "tool to attack others." Opinion: Moment of truth for North Korea over human rights
A protester who wanted his message to stick managed to superglue himself to the British prime minister Tuesday evening. Dan Glass, right, takes hold of the British PM's right arm just before he was about to receive his award. Dan Glass was at 10 Downing Street to receive a charity's award for his work on transportation issues when he staged the unusual protest. Just before Prime Minister Gordon Brown presented him with the award, Glass squirted superglue in the palm of his left hand. He shook Brown's right hand and then grabbed the prime minister's sleeve. "I've just superglued myself to your arm," Glass said he told Brown. "Don't panic. This is a non-violent protest." Glass is affiliated with the group Plane Stupid, which campaigns against airport expansion and climate change. He said he acted to protest Brown's "hypocrisy" on the issues.  Watch Glass explain his actions on CNN » "I just wanted a few more minutes of his time to get the message across, because he's not listening to communities affected by airport expansion," Glass told CNN on Wednesday. The prime minister managed to free himself in about 30 seconds, Glass said. "He can shake off my arm, but he cannot shake away climate change," he added. Glass also claimed that some people in the room actually applauded when they realized what has happening. "I think he [Brown] knew he was outnumbered on this issue," Glass said. A Brown spokesman called the incident "minor" and "very lighthearted." Glass said he was allowed to remain at the prime minister's residence for about 40 minutes after the event. "I think Brown would have been humiliated further if an actual award winner had been ejected from the ceremony," he said. Police filed no charges. According to their website, the Plane Stupid group formed in 2005 inspired by the anti-roads protests in Britain during the mid-1990s. The group -- which describes itself as non-partisan --is funded primarily by donations from individuals and organizations. Members are encouraged to take direct but non-violent action against the aviation industry, a sector they describe as "one of the root causes of climate change."
Since "The Blair Witch Project," "Cloverfield" and "Paranormal Activity," it's been impossible to see a camcorder movie without steeling yourself for some monstrous horror lurking just offscreen. "Project X" is supposed to be a comedy, but parents with teenagers -- or parents with kids who may one day turn into teenagers -- will regard it with much the same mixture of dread and terror. It's Thomas' 17th birthday. Mom and Dad have recklessly elected to take off for the weekend. Sure, they know he'll probably have friends over, but they trust him to use his common sense, and anyway, he doesn't have that many friends. But they reckon without the influence of his determined buddy Costa, who puts all his considerable social networking skills to promoting what turns out to be the ultimate house party. Beer will be chugged, tequila slammed, pills popped (cherries too), furnishings trashed, cars crashed, there will be fire, SWAT teams and loud noise late into the night. Oh yes, my friends, the peace will be disturbed! There's nothing new about any of this -- the wild party is firmly entrenched in youths' rites of passage in the movies and in high school lore across the land. In my day, it was Tom Cruise turning his home into a brothel and getting on the wrong side of Guido the Killer Pimp. Now, it's Thomas Mann orchestrating a rave in his backyard and stupidly ripping off a frazzled drug dealer by the name of T-Rick. (Kids, if you take away just one lesson from this movie, let it be this: There's no percentage in ripping off your dealer.) Still, it seems to me Cruise was at least respectful of those working girls. To Thomas and the gangsta-mouthed Costa (Oliver Cooper), even their classmates are "hos" and "b*tches." If this movie has it right, today's teen culture is about what you would expect from a demographic brainwashed on a junk media diet of rap, pornography and reality TV. Please note, I said "If." "Superbad" seems almost quaint in comparison -- and a whole lot funnier, in my opinion. Not that there's any point in sermonizing about such a self-consciously anarchic celebration of adolescent hedonism. There's not much to it, but at least there's a trace of punk rebellion in the orgy of destruction visited on a comfortably middle-class suburban home -- even if the coda dubiously suggests that this could be the shortcut to social status and parental respect. Yeah, as my kid would say, right. Directed by newcomer Nima Nourizadeh from what must have been a stick-thin screenplay, "Project X" loses more than it gains from the "videography" gambit. It is indifferently acted and in too much of a rush for quick hits to establish anything like the lull and swell of a real rave -- there's no undertow, no rapture, just a randomized string of highs and lows. Even the hangover is shortchanged (despite a producer credit for "Hangover" director Todd Phillips). That's not to say there aren't at least a few outrageous gags, YouTube moments to share, but mostly this looks like exactly what it is: a wasted opportunity.
Emergency calls highlight the confusion in a Virginia Beach, Virginia, neighborhood after a Navy fighter jet crashed last week, with one woman reporting that a pilot was on her patio awaiting medical aid. Authorities released recordings of the calls on Monday, three days after the F/A-18 Hornet slammed into an apartment complex about two miles from the naval air station where it took off. "Nobody's here, and I keep calling and there's no ambulance," one woman told a 911 dispatcher from her condominium a few blocks from the crash site. She said one of two fliers who ejected from the stricken warplane was outside, that he was conscious and that she had already called for help. "He's still on my patio, but they told me to evacuate, and there's other guys there helping him," the unidentified woman says. "My neighbor's there helping him." Seven people, including the two-person crew of the Hornet, were injured when the aircraft crashed into a Virginia Beach apartment complex on Friday. But there were no fatalities, a fact that Adm. John Harvey called a "miracle" over the weekend. "A Navy plane just went down on 24th Street," a man says in another call to dispatchers. "It hit an apartment complex and I saw the, um, the pilot bail out. The pilot did bail out -- I saw it -- but it hit the apartment complex." The aircraft experienced a "catastrophic mechanical malfunction" during takeoff from Naval Air Station Oceana on Friday, raining jet fuel over Virginia Beach before plunging to the ground, according to residents and Navy officials. It landed upright and in flames in the middle of the courtyard of the Mayfair Mews apartment complex, setting five surrounding buildings on fire. "There's a terrible fire at the Mayfair Mews apartment building. ... Oh my God! It's like something keeps exploding or something," another woman tells dispatchers. The jet carried a student pilot in the front seat and an experienced instructor behind him, and the leakage of jet fuel was "one of the indications that there was a mechanical malfunction," Navy Capt. Mark Weisgerber told reporters. The plane was part of a training squadron at Oceana and was not carrying live ordnance. The Navy said Monday that investigators have recovered the flight recorder from the Hornet. The device, which records flight data but not cockpit voices, has been sent to a Navy air base at Patuxent River, Maryland, for analysis, Navy officials said in a written statement Monday afternoon. The wing and part of the fuselage of the plane were being moved to Oceana for further study, but the remains of the jet's twin engines will remain at the crash site for now as investigators study them, the U.S. Atlantic fleet's aviation arm reported. The Navy expects to finish removing most aircraft debris by the end of the week as part of its investigation. And the service will soon begin cutting compensation checks to the people who lost their homes in the crash, said Rear Adm. Tim Alexander, commander of the Navy's Mid-Atlantic region. "We are committed to doing the right thing to address the needs of these families, who through no fault of their own have endured an incredible hardship," Alexander said. "We owe it to everyone affected by Friday's accident to help them get their life back together." Initial payments will begin at $2,300 per person to cover immediate needs, such as housing, meals and clothing. The amount will increase for additional family members. Counseling and legal services also will be available, Alexander said. Residents who completed claims by Saturday could receive payments by Monday. CNN's Barbara Starr and Sandra Endo contributed to this report.
The remains of what was Christchurch Cathedral, whose shattered spire became a symbol of the New Zealand city's quake devastation, is to be dismantled after Anglican church officials said the earthquake had damaged the structure of the iconic church beyond repair. Bishop Victoria Matthews said the existing church walls would be brought down to about 3 meters and the base of the church kept for use as a prayer garden. Officials had thought part of the building could be saved but said on Friday that recent aftershocks had made the existing structure unsound. "What we need to do is bring the walls down to a safe level which is probably about 2-3 meters," Bishop Matthews said. "There will be no bulldozers, no wrecking ball. This will be done with deep respect and love." The cathedral -- one of the city's best-known historic buildings -- was severely damaged in the earthquake on February 22, 2011, its neo-gothic spire crashing to the ground. The quake destroyed many buildings in Christchurch's central business district and killed 185 people. When the deadly quake hit New Zealand News of its demolition was greeted with dismay in Christchurch where heritage campaigners say the decision was taken without public consultation. Christchurch City Councillor Aaron Keown vowed to protest to stop the demolition and said there was widespread support for his position. "I would be in there chaining myself to the building to stop that and I know lots of other volunteers would come in to do that," he told the Christchurch Press. Bishop Matthews said the cost of saving the cathedral was "staggering" and that NZ$50 million (US$42 million) would be needed to rebuild existing parts of the building or NZ$100 million for a complete reconstruction. She said bringing the walls down to a safe level would allow officials to retrieve artworks and other church relics still inside the structure. The cathedral is within Christchurch's "red zone," the worst-hit area of the city where many of the buildings still remain too unstable to enter. The Anglican Church has said that it is committed to building a new cathedral, but no plans have been drawn up about where it will be placed, how much it will cost or what it will look like. The 131-year-old cathedral had previously been damaged in earthquakes in 1881, 1888, 1901 and in 2010, according to its website.
As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that "then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end," according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. "Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left," Bush will say. "Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' " the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. "Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently," Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, "President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. "While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall." The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to "provide broader context" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop "surge" in Iraq until the report comes out in September.  Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government » It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. "In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom," Bush will say. "Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies." Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time "critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home." "While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word," Bush will say. "Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime."

Kevin Pietersen's career as an international cricketer has been ended by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The ECB said Tuesday that it was not considering the batsmen for selection for the upcoming tour of the West Indies or the ICC World Twenty20 which takes place in Bangladesh during March and April. In a statement released on the ECB website, England cricket's governing body said the time had come to start the rebuilding process following the tour of Australia in which England were whitewashed 5-0 in the Ashes Test series. Read more: Australia completes Ashes rout of England In a statement released Tuesday, ECB managing director Paul Downton said: "Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England as the fact that he is the country's leading run scorer in international cricket demonstrates. "However everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long term planning after the Australia tour. Therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also team ethic and philosophy. "England cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Kevin who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill. "This decision brings some clarity now for the future of the England teams and we all wish Kevin the very best in the rest of his career." Pietersen, a hugely talented and flamboyant batsmen, burst onto the Test scene in 2005 against Australia scoring two half-centuries on his debut at Lord's. The two innings set the tone for a maverick career in which he amassed 8181 runs in 104 Tests including 23 centuries and a further 5,616 runs in one-day and Twenty20 internationals combined. For all his runs on the pitch -- Pietersen is England's leading international run-scorer -- the 33-year-old has also been perceived to be a divisive figure in the dressing room at times during his career. Pietersen said in the ECB statement that it had been a "huge honor" to play for his country. "Every time I pulled on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and that is something that will live with me forever," Pietersen said. "Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years. "I feel extremely fortunate to have played at a time of great success for England cricket alongside some of the best cricketers the country has ever produced. "I want to thank everyone for their fantastic support and I wish the team the very best of success going forward. "I believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer. I will continue to play but deeply regret that it won't be for England." The news of Pietersen's departure from the international scene saddened and confused his former England captain Michael Vaughan who tweeted: "Sad way to end a mavericks England Career .@KP24 will be missed...Would love to know what he does that is unmanageable !!??"
The Teflon Don is dead and gone. The Mustache Petes of the Mafia's old guard are mostly behind bars. And the crime rackets have gone global. Think La Cosa Nostra is just a quaint throwback, the stuff of gangster movies? Fuggedaboudit. Although the Mafia may not be as strong as it once was, FBI agents say organized crime is far from dead. Not only is the traditional mob still at it, but new organized crime groups also are vying for a piece of the action. Weakened by two decades of prosecutions, the traditional Italian crime organizations plug away at what they know best: labor racketeering, infiltrating unions and construction industries, gambling and loan sharking. "What you see in the movies about honor and code is a fallacy. That doesn't exist. It's completely about the money," said Mike Gaeta, a veteran agent who heads the FBI squad in charge of investigating the Genovese family. "As the economy evolves, they evolve."  Watch how the FBI's tactics have changed over the years » The scams are growing in sophistication, focusing more than ever on the big money. Everyone pays the price, according to Gaeta. "There is a mob tax placed on everything from your garbage collection, food delivery, the rent that you pay," he said. "I don't know what the percentage is, but there is a premium that you pay because of the control that organized crime has on labor unions and on the contractors who are engaged in those job sites." There are more than 3,000 Mafia members and associates in the U.S., the FBI estimates on its Web site. The presence is most pronounced around New York, southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The FBI has about 100 agents and 11 squads investigating mob activities at the New York hub. The FBI touts its success against New York's five major Mafia families -- Gambino, Genovese, Bonanno, Colombo and Lucchese -- as one of the bureau's biggest accomplishments in its 100-year history. Major arrests and convictions in the 1980s and 1990s crippled the mob. If they didn't get whacked first, the top dogs of the five families faced multiple prosecutions and long prison terms. Among the big names to take the perp walk as a result: John Gotti, Vincent Gigante and Joseph Massino.  Learn more about mob bosses » The federal racketeering law passed in 1970 known as the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO, allowed agents to build stronger cases and secure stiffer sentences. It was added to the bureau's traditional crime-fighting arsenal of wiretaps, physical surveillance of targets and undercover agents. As the years rolled by, the FBI benefited from "flipping" mob insiders like Massino, who, facing life sentences for RICO convictions, decided to violate the Mafia's code of silence -- omerta. Massino talked to avoid the death penalty for murder, becoming the Mafia's highest-ranking turncoat, and is now serving a life sentence. Seamus McElearney, who spearheads FBI investigations against the Colombo crime family, has persuaded several mobsters to turn informant, and one case sticks out in his mind. "This individual was able to realize that he'd be going away for the rest of his life, and like anything in life, you build a rapport with someone, and you have to get over that trust factor. And he started to trust me and realize this was his best option," McElearney said, describing what it takes to persuade a witness to switch sides. The FBI also uses forensic accounting and other sophisticated tools to penetrate the mob. "Looking at these guys from a financial point of view, because that's one of the best ways to hurt them is in the pocketbook ... ultimately led to the devastation of the family," said Supervisory Special Agent Nora Conley, who investigates the Bonanno family. The mob adapted to investigations and convictions as layer upon layer of wiseguys-in-waiting stepped up. The Italians may still control the lion's share of illegal organized crime activity, but competitors are vying for a piece of the action. Law enforcement officials say Asians, Russians and Albanians have established their own crime organizations in the United States. These groups are smaller and more disorganized than their Italian counterparts but pose their own danger. Kevin Hallinan, an FBI supervisor who has worked organized crime for 18 years, said that groups of Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese nationals, for example, are heavily involved in immigrant-smuggling, gambling, prostitution, counterfeiting and extortion of legitimate businesses as well as other crimes. "Drugs are a serious problem," Hallinan said. "It's quick money. They have known transportation routes. A lot of the folks have international connections and know people at the ports, at the airports, and can get the drugs here." He continued, "the big challenge for Asian organized crime and Albanian organized crime is having the finances to pay for a load of heroin, to pay for a load of cocaine, and then have the facilitator get it into the country, and then have the means of distribution, which the Italians have had in the past." Russian and Albanian groups "are more like criminal enterprises than organized crime," observes agent Dennis Bolles, who heads the squad investigating them. "Whether it is insurance fraud, bank fraud, identity theft, Medicaid fraud, securities fraud, mortgage fraud [or] multimillion-dollar scams, the Russians are very sophisticated," Bolles said. "They are very educated people. Some are former KGB. Some are former government officials -- masters degrees, PhDs -- and now they find themselves in the U.S., and they are using those brains to commit scams." The FBI learned the hard way that foot-dragging on organized crime investigations can be costly. In the 1930s, as Genovese family leader Lucky Luciano rose to power and brought the five families into a unified commission, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover resisted going after the mob. His inaction allowed the Mafia to become fully entrenched into American society and business.  Watch how Hoover dropped the ball » It wasn't until the 1950s that the Mafia became a law enforcement priority. Sen. Estes Kefauver led congressional hearings on organized crime in May 1950, and the 1963 congressional testimony of Mafia turncoat Joseph Valachi brought attention to a problem that long had been ignored. "From there, the program skyrocketed and became a very material priority for the FBI as criminal programs," Assistant FBI Director Mark Mershon said. FBI officials credit that effort and the intelligence-gathering skills learned in mob investigations for giving today's agents a foundation for future investigations, including of terrorists. "You have to understand who are the players, who are the leaders, how are they financed, how do they recruit, how do they handle their memberships," FBI Director Robert Mueller recently said as the bureau approached the 100-year mark. CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.
Dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, whose artwork is shown in museums around the world, is taking a different direction with his latest project -- a heavy metal album. Ai wrote and sang each of the nine tracks on the debut album, which is called "Divina Commedia" after a poem by Italian poet Dante, and will be released next month. "The lyrics are about the current political situation," he told CNN by telephone from Beijing. One song is about Chen Guangcheng, the blind activist who fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing after escaping from house arrest last year. Another mentions Wang Lijun, the police chief who also sought shelter with U.S. officials last year, in Chengdu, a move which exposed the scandal engulfing disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai and his wife, now convicted murderer, Gu Kailai. Ai Weiwei: Despite flaws, America should be proud Outspoken and provocative, Ai is perhaps best known for his work on the famous "Bird's Nest" stadium built for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. His critical stance toward the Chinese government gained attention after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that left nearly 90,000 dead, including many children who died when their shoddily-constructed schools collapsed. A recent exhibition of his work at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC featured hundreds of children's backpacks lashed together in the shape of a snake, which Ai said represented the bags left behind by the students. While a departure from his acclaimed sculpture and installations, the album is not his first foray into the world of music -- last October he filmed a parody of "Gangnam Style," the surprise worldwide hit by Korean rapper Psy. In that clip, Ai limited his musical involvement to dancing, but other clips can be found on the Internet of the artist flexing his vocal cords. Ai told CNN the decision to branch out into music stemmed from his detention in 2011 when his guards would ask him to sing a tune to pass the time. Ai was taken into custody in April and detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists. He was accused of evading a huge amount of taxes, charges Ai has said were trumped up. Ai was released but with heavy restrictions on his movements and the Chinese government still holds his passport. While Ai describes the tracks as "heavy metal" or "hard rock", it was an encounter with pop star Elton John that encouraged him to finally complete the album. John dedicated his performance in Beijing in November to Ai, who at the time said he was deeply touched by the gesture. Ai cited few musical influences and said he knew little about Western popular music despite a stint living in New York in the 1980s: "When I grew up all the music we had was revolutionary stuff." Ai said he would try to release the album in China next month, along with a music video, but he was gloomy about its prospects. "I am completely censored," he said. "I will put it online so people can download it but I think the authorities will just delete it."
When Russia bid to host its first Winter Olympics back in 2007, the document quoted an expected cost of around $12 billion. However, as the extensive renovation of the city of Sochi has unfolded in the years since successfully winning the rights to stage the Games, that number has ballooned to around $50 billion -- more than four times over budget. It will be the most expensive Olympics yet, surpassing Beijing's 2008 Summer Games. The Russian government says that much of this has been sunk into infrastructure -- upgrading travel links such as airports and train stations, building new roads, houses, hotels and conference centers and providing the other necessary utilities to welcome thousands of visitors. According to both President Vladimir Putin and his predecessor, the present Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the "sports-related" costs have come to about $6.4 billion. This has largely come from building 10 competition venues, both down on the Black Sea coast in Sochi's Olympic area and up in the mountain cluster in Krasnaya Polyana -- which not long ago had just one ski lift. The Games will launch with the February 7 opening ceremony at the $600 million Fisht Stadium, which will not host any sporting events but will close the Olympics two and a half weeks later. The arena will then be used by Russia's national football team and will host matches at the 2018 World Cup with an expanded capacity of 45,000. Watch: Sochi by numbers
Uga VII, the University of Georgia mascot whose deeply furrowed face was a fixture at the school for more than a year, died early Thursday, the university said. He was 4 years old. The purebred English bulldog died of heart-related causes in Savannah, Georgia, according to its owner, Frank "Sonny" Seiler. Fans knew Uga VII had arrived when the white dog, sporting a spiked collar and red Georgia University jersey, made his short strides along the football field's sidelines. He made his first appearance at the August 30, 2008, season opener, when Georgia faced off against Georgia Southern, the university said. He was nearing the end of his second season with the team, the university said. He was preceded by his father, Uga VI, the university's winningest mascot, who died of congestive heart failure. "This is a very sad day for the Seiler family but also for all Georgia people," said Damon Evans, University of Georgia director of athletics in a university news release. "Just as his ancestors, he had captured the hearts of college football fans everywhere as the country's No. 1 mascot. He had been truly embraced by all those who follow the Georgia Bulldogs across the country. We will miss him dearly." Uga VII's given name was Loran's Best, the university said. His death was unexpected. "We are all in a state of shock," Seiler said in the release. "We had no warning whatsoever." A wreath will be placed on Uga VII's doghouse on the sideline, the university said. There won't be a live mascot to take his place at Saturday's game against Kentucky. Officials have not decided who will replace the white bulldog, but the decision is expected next year, Seiler said. Until then, fans and Seiler will mourn the loss of the school's favorite pooch. "He was 10-3 last year, which is not bad for a freshman," Seiler said. "Uga VII was not as active or mischievous as his father but more distinguished. He realized his role when he put his shirt on. He was well-behaved and always appreciated the significance of his role."
Throughout Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio's campaign for New York's top political act, his backup band seemed to overshadow the headliner. His son Dante, a sophomore at a public high school in Brooklyn, appeared prominently in campaign ads, his soaring Afro a topic of conversation in political circles. Daughter Chiara, a college freshman, out-danced the rest of the telegenic family at the West Indian Day Parade with a move they called "The Smackdown." Watch the de Blasios dance "The Smackdown" A virtual unknown nationally despite 25 years in New York politics, de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and, most recently, as public advocate -- a sort of civic watchdog -- sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton's first U.S. Senate campaign. But his biracial family's increasing visibility resonated with residents of a city coping with a 21% poverty rate and increasing racial divisiveness brought on by the controversial "stop-and-frisk" policy allowing police to search people in high-crime areas. "His family, just because of the racial mix, represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities," said Harold Ickes, a veteran Democratic Party operative who advised the campaign and has known de Blasio for two decades. "The family is very important to Bill... From the outside, this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government." The de Blasio clan was featured prominently in commercials and campaign events. Dante, then 15, appeared in his own ad over the summer that highlighted his father's stance against "stop-and-frisk." Dante and his hair immediately became a social media sensation -- and de Blasio began to surge in the polls. In addition, Chirlane McCray, a political activist who once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio, emerged as a top campaign strategist. 5 things to know about New York's new mayor DeBlasio, 52, portrayed himself as the "unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era," saying that the current mayor's polices favor the rich. He repeatedly used the Dickensian phrase "a tale of two cities" to describe New York City under billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The wealth inequality message appeared to have struck home with minority and low-income voters on Tuesday, giving de Blasio an advantage over Republican candidate Joe Lhota among black and Latino voters compared to white voters. "The city is much more racially mixed than when Bloomberg took office," Ickes said. "A lot of people having a hard time economically are black, Hispanic and Asian and Bill spoke elegantly to that." De Blasio's critics accused him of dividing the city along economic and racial lines, and credited "stop-and-frisk" with a sharp crime reduction during Bloomberg's tenure. Appearing on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper on Wednesday, Bloomberg said he had a meeting with de Blasio and vowed to help with the transition. "Keep in mind, I have a big vested interest in making Bill de Blasio an even better mayor than I was," Bloomberg said. "We built a lot. We've given them a lot to work with... But the bottom line is, I'm going to live in New York City and I want Bill de Blasio's administration to be successful and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we've been doing over." De Blasio, who has a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's in international and public affairs from Columbia University, met McCray while working in the administration of David Dinkins, the city's first black mayor. When de Blasio delivered his acceptance speech late on Election Day, he was surrounded, like most of the campaign, by his family. The strapping politician, the first Democratic mayor in the largely-Democratic city in two decades, hugged son and daughter and planted a firm kiss on the lips of his wife before going on to thank the many people behind his triumph. "The people I'm most grateful to and most grateful for are standing next to me," he said amid cheers and applause. "My partner in life, my best friend in the world: she is brilliant and every bit as compassionate as she is tough, the love of my life Chirlane McCray." He added, "Of everything I have to feel fortunate about, I am most lucky, most blessed to be the father of two extraordinary children: Chiara and Dante. They make me proud every single day. And, my fellow New Yorkers, they are very stylish." De Blasio greeted his supporters in both Spanish and Italian. McCray introduced him: "From our family to your family, I give you the next mayor of New York City."
A 6.0-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia on Saturday, days after a temblor left dozens dead in the nation. The quake struck off the island of Sumatra, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It had earlier stated it was a 6.4-magnitude quake, but revised the number. No tsunami alert was issued, officials said. Indonesia is still recovering from a 6.1-magnitude quake that killed 35 people and injured 275 others three days ago, the national disaster agency reported. In the last earthquake, the death and destruction were mainly in the province of Aceh on the island of Sumatra. Indonesia is on the Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake off the coast of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in 14 countries. The majority of the deaths were in Indonesia, with Aceh bearing the brunt.
I have vivid memories of childhood. The 5-year-old girl with endless questions; she wanted to discover the secrets of the entire world within minutes. She dreamed of being a doctor once, an engineer another time, and a mother of lovely kids. A dreamer, this is how I would describe the little girl Reem. Reem is a 22-year-old student living in Gaza City. Days passed fast. Reem couldn't remember a lot of them, but she had some moments left in her memory -- usually the happy moments of her life -- and those memories were the basis for today's Reem, the 22-year-old girl who is ME. I remember how happy I was when my teacher announced to the school that I was first in my class. I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet. I can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration. I can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth » Sometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place. But life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school. I was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media. All my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally. My ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian. Usually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be. It's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom. I found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States and whom I contact through the Global Citizen Corps. I have realized how similar Palestinian youth are to youth all over the world. Catherine likes some of the food I like, and she loves swimming just like I do. There are also lovely differences between us: I tried to cook what she taught me once, and she is learning Arabic now. Maybe our lifestyle is different. I focus on my own development; I spend most of my time working to become a more qualified person with more knowledge and skills. I do not work hard because I am super girl or I aspire to be one but because I always want to be ready for the worst situation. In Palestine where I live, surprises can happen at any time, and I don't want to be caught off guard. I want to make my future secure by being a really good person. I deserve to live. I enjoy my life as it is now, but I hope that when I find a scholarship and live in the West, I will not be obliged to take off my scarf and won't hear negative comments about me because I am Muslim. I consider religion a personal freedom that is related to your beliefs and what you feel in your heart. I love letting others live in peace. ... Why can't we enjoy peace, too? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.
Billy Wharton should be happy. "Socialized health care" is on its way. The "socialist agenda" is taking over America. And best of all, Barack Obama, a "committed socialist ideologue," is in the Oval Office. But Wharton, co-chair of the Socialist Party USA, sees no reason to celebrate. He's seen people with bumper stickers and placards that call Obama a socialist, and he has a message for them: Obama isn't a socialist. He's not even a liberal. "We didn't see a great victory with the election of Barack Obama," Wharton says, " and we certainly didn't see our agenda move from the streets to the White House." Are many Americans secret socialists? Obama's opponents have long described him as a socialist. But what do actual socialists think about Obama? Not much, says Wharton. "He's the president whose main goal is to protect the wealth of the richest 5 percent of Americans." He and others say the assertion that Obama is a socialist is absurd. "It makes no rational sense. It clearly means that people don't understand what socialism is." Definitions of socialism vary, but most socialists believe workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own or control them. Not all socialists, though, want to confiscate personal property. Democratic Socialists are more interested in protecting ordinary people from unregulated capitalism through regulation and progressive taxation. Some of the socialist agenda is already part of American life, according to Wharton and others. Social Security, Medicare, unemployment benefits -- all reflect socialistic values, says Van Gosse, an associate professor of history at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who has researched socialist movements in the United States and Latin America. The widely accepted notions of public education and Pell Grants for college students are socialistic in origin, Gosse says. They fit well with the socialistic premise that government should provide basic security from the cradle to the grave to all of its citizens, he says. "We assert that education should not be left up to the private market -- where those who can pay, get it and those who can't, don't get it," Gosse says. "It's a common good and in that sense it is a socialistic institution even if the U.S. remains a capitalist nation." Why socialists hate Obama's health care bill Those who call Obama a socialist, though, point to his policies. Big on their hit list: "Obamacare," which they call "socialized medicine." Socialists scoff at the notion. They don't applaud the passage of the recent health care bill either. They wanted a national "single-payer" health insurance plan with a government option. The bill that Obama championed didn't have any of those features. Wharton said the new health care bill only strengthens private health insurance companies. They get 32 million new customers and no incentive to change -- something a socialist wouldn't accept. "Most of it was authored by the health care industry," Wharton says. "I call it the corporate restructuring of health care." Other critics point to Obama's Wall Street bailout -- which actually had its roots in the Bush administration. Critics say it's socialistic for government to assume control of private industry. Frank Llewellyn, national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, says the bailout had nothing to do with socialism. Llewellyn says a socialist leader would have at least nationalized some of the troubled banks. "He gave them [the banks] too much with no strings attached," Llewellyn says. "Banks that were too big to fail are bigger, and they can still fail." How about Obama's bailout of the Detroit auto industry? During the bailout, the federal government assumed partial ownership of General Motors. "It's not socialism," Llewellyn says. "The mere fact that the government owns something or has a stake in it, doesn't make it socialist. If that was true, you would say that we have a socialist army. The government owns the army." Defining socialism is complex, Llewellyn says, but it starts with a simple goal: Socialists want to introduce democratic features into the economy to reduce inequality. The economy has "to be run for the overall benefit of the entire population, not for the benefits of a very few people." By that measure, Obama's economic policies are not socialist, he says. "He's trying to save capitalism from itself rather than a radical trying to change into a new system," Llewellyn says. This kind of name-calling is not new. Civil rights demonstrators and the politicians who passed Medicare were also called socialists and communists, Llewellyn says. "Every time an expansion of the public's right has been put forward, Republicans have called it extreme, communistic and socialistic. It's a repeated tactic because they can't defeat the idea." A Tea Party member explains why Obama is a socialist Those arguments don't sway Conrad Quagliaroli, a Tea Party member who says Obama is a socialist. He says that Obama's voting record as a senator was more to the left than the U.S. Senate's sole socialist, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He says Obama's association with radicals and his pledge to "spread the wealth" seal his socialistic credentials. "The role of government is to provide a safe environment to conduct business, not to take from one and give to the other," says Quagliaroli, a financial planner who lives in Woodstock, Georgia. Quagliaroli was not persuaded by the arguments of other socialist leaders who reject the idea that Obama is a socialist. "He's just not socialist enough for them." Quagliaroli says he doesn't like socialism because it breeds mediocrity and encourages people to "live on the dole." Capitalism "breeds excellence" because it encourages initiative, he says. Does that mean that Quagliaroli will refuse his Social Security checks, a government program that has been described as socialistic, and which he opposes? Not necessarily, says Quagliaroli. He says he'll accept his Social Security checks for two reasons. "They confiscated it from me to begin with, and the more money they give me, the less they'll have to waste," he says. "I can spend it better than they can. I don't pay $500 for a hammer." The argument over Obama's ideology may rage on, but at least one socialist says another prominent politician ought to be inserted into the debate. Llewellyn, the national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, says he was struck by one player in the 2008 presidential elections who displayed more socialistic leanings than Obama. This candidate raised taxes on the big oil companies, and sent the revenue to the people. If you want to learn something about spreading the wealth, Llewellyn says, don't look to Obama. "To be honest, the most socialist candidate in the 2008 election was Sarah Palin."
The captain of Southwest Flight 345, whose nose gear was broken while landing at LaGuardia Airport in New York last month, took control of the aircraft from his co-pilot when the plane was below 400 feet -- a critical phase of flight during which control is rarely changed between pilots, experts say. The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday updated its investigation into the July 22 incident, noting the last-minute cockpit switch but did not reveal the captain's explanation for the change. Other details released by the safety board, however, could provide an explanation, pilots contacted by CNN said. The Southwest pilots told investigators the wind changed direction as the plane was landing, shifting from an 11-knot tailwind below 1,000 feet to an 11-knot headwind on the runway. Passenger sues airline over LaGuardia nose landing The captain took control at a point roughly midway through that period, "at a point below 400 feet," the NTSB said. The wind shift, experts said, could have caused the plane to deviate from its glide path. "This wind shift will most likely be part of the focus of this investigation," said Capt. Kevin Hiatt of the Flight Safety Foundation. "The captain evidently saw something that concerned him enough that he elected to take control of the aircraft at that time," Hiatt said. "Does it happen? Not often. Does it happen sometimes? Yes, it does." While emphasizing that it is still early in the investigation, pilots consulted by CNN said it is unusual for a pilot to take control of an aircraft in the final moments of landing. Investigators likely are questioning the pilot about that decision, and, if there were problems with the approach, why he did not abort the landing. "That's a key question: why did the captain feel the need to take over?" said Mark Weiss, a former 737 pilot and civil aviation leader at The Spectrum Group in Washington. Commercial aircraft can manage abrupt changes in wind direction, experts say. But the changing wind direction would have tilted the plane nose-up, and the pilot may have responded by pushing the nose down to maintain the proper glide path, pilots contacted by CNN speculated. 'It was pretty chaotic' as landing gear collapses, passenger says The Boeing 737-700 aircraft went from a 2 degrees nose-up attitude, when the plane was about 32 feet off the ground, to a 3-degrees nose-down attitude upon landing seconds later, according to information previously released by the NTSB. The plane landed nose wheels first, instead of on the main landing gear as designed, and the nose gear collapsed, sending the plane on a lengthy skid down the runway. About 10 passengers were injured. The NTSB said it has thus far found no anomalies or mechanical malfunctions with the plane. It is continuing its investigation. Among the new details released Tuesday by the safety board: -- The captain of Southwest Flight 345 had flown for the airline for almost 13 years and had been a captain for six of those years. He had 12,000 total flight hours, including 2,600 hours as pilot-in-command of B-737s. This was the pilot's second flight into LaGuardia, and he was "pilot monitoring" in both instances. (Pilots tell CNN the captain's inexperience flying into LaGuardia was likely not a factor in the incident. Commercial pilots frequently fly into unfamiliar airports and study the approaches before landing. In addition, the pilots of Flight 345 were using an operational instrument landing system, which should have assisted in making the landing routine.) -- The first officer had been with Southwest for 18 months and had 5,200 total flight hours, with 4,000 as pilot-in-command. He had about 1,100 hours in B-737s, with none of those as pilot-in-command. The first officer had experience at LaGuardia, including six flights this year. -- This was the first trip the flight crew had flown together and was the second leg of the trip. -- The weather in the New York area caused the flight to enter a holding pattern for about 15 minutes. The crew reported that they saw the airport from about 5 to 10 miles out and that the airplane was on speed, course and glide slope down to about 200 to 400 feet. -- Investigators have five videos showing various aspects of the crash landing.
For Roland Emmerich, the easy choice would have been to join the family business. Roland Emmerich and his younger sister Ute as children in Germany. They now work together in Hollywood. His father had founded a thriving garden machinery company, but young Roland's interest in lawnmowers, and their like, was limited. "I knew very early that I didn't want to do that," Emmerich says. "But I also didn't know what I wanted to do, so I was dabbling in a lot of things. And then actually after a while, it slowly occurred to me that maybe film would be great." He entered film school with the intention of becoming a production designer but came out a director. "In film school, I had to make movies, so I made movies and was quite successful and all of a sudden I was a director." The way he tells it makes it sound simple. And maybe it was. He went to one of Germany's leading film schools, The University of Television and Film Munich, which boasts an impressive alumni of respected directors: Wim Wenders, Bernd Eichinger, Uli Edel and Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, among others. He had the backing of a loving family; according to his sister Ute his "very, very supportive" father lent him office space in his factory and helped finance his early films.  Ute shows Revealed the family album » Nor was he the first German director to make it big in Hollywood; Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder had well and truly paved the way. What made Roland Emmerich different, and his Hollywood assent difficult, was his near obsession with special effects and monumental disasters; explosions, floods, tidal waves, and general destruction, both alien and earthly. Not only were his films expensive to make, but gallingly for German critics they weren't, well, very German. "I was making movies like I'm doing now, but it was like a whole different world at that time in Germany," Emmerich says. "They did Wim Wenders movies and all these kind of German movies and I just couldn't make movies like that. I wanted to make movies like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. I just did it and they were relatively successful, but critically more and more hated. They said: 'Why is he making movies like this here?'" So now he's making films in Los Angeles, where he has a home just a few minutes drive from Hollywood, and his younger sister Ute.  Roland gives Revealed a tour of his home » "Ute was like me," Roland says. "She didn't want to work in the family company and it was a good opportunity to work for me, it was more exciting." The siblings set up their own production company, Centroplis Entertainment,  through which they've made 14 feature films. The move to Hollywood came after Roland directed "Moon 44", released in 1990; a science fiction action film set in 2038 about robots, convicts and companies fighting over mining rights in outer space. It earned him an invitation to Los Angeles and a job directing "Universal Soldier." Ute remembers, "It was decided that we close our office [in Germany] and just try and see how it would work out for a year. Our parents, I think, were hoping that we would come back within a year, but eighteen years later, and so many movies and successes later, we are still here," she says. Roland has made himself very much at home in Los Angeles. Ten years ago he bought a house -- his own slice of Hollywood history -- a three bedroom mansion built in 1919 by Jesse Lasky, who, with Cecil B. DeMille, produced "The Squaw Man," Hollywood's first feature film. "I told Constance, my real estate broker, 'Look, don't come to me with something which doesn't have either Hollywood history or a really, really big garden'. I just wanted to have a big garden because I grew up in a house with a big garden." In the end, he got both. The garden is an impressive oasis of towering palms, tangled vines and lush ferns, all lining an imposing staircase that leads to a pool where the director hosts parties for friends and colleagues. While Hollywood has embraced Roland Emmerich's action-packed, effect-laden style of epic story-telling, the director is less than enamored with its lifeblood, the film industry. "I don't really like the movie business, I have to say. It's a very cold, brutal business. It's not a cozy living. But, on the other hand, I really like making movies," he says. "I'm constantly torn between, should I keep going or not. And then I always want to make another movie and then I have to deal with it. But every time I come into a situation, I'm always talking about early retirement, which makes all my friends laugh out loud." They might laugh out louder if he ever contemplated a return to the family business.
Perhaps Tim Meadows' invitation back to "Saturday Night Live" got lost in the mail. The actor, who appeared on "SNL" from 1991 to 2000, initially seemed upset to see the show bring back its Bill Brasky sketch without him on Saturday. Written by "SNL" alums Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, the sketch revolved around guys recalling the daring feats of legendary businessman Bill Brasky. At the heart of it was Ferrell who, with teeth too large and a drunken slur, would join his compatriots in toasting Brasky's awesomeness. With Ferrell back on the show Saturday, "SNL" resurrected the sketch and tapped his "Anchorman 2" co-stars David Koechner and Paul Rudd, host of the night's episode, to join him. Most viewers were probably thrilled to see the sketch return, but Meadows apparently was shocked. "They did Brasky without me ... ," he posted on his Facebook page. "Not even a 'hey would you want to come to do one line and bring your kids to see (One Direction)...?' Nothing ... Wow ... I guess I know my place." Meadows said he's "grateful for what they did for me" but it "stings a little to not even be considered as someone they would like to come back around. ... Sorry ('The Ladies Man') bombed. ... (I)f it would have done better they wouldn't treat me like a red-headed stepchild." Other Brasky sketch regulars from the old days, such as Alec Baldwin and John Goodman, were also missing in action, and Meadows suggested the bit appeared to double as an "Anchorman 2" promo. "I'm sure it's economics and budget," he said Sunday morning. "I'm not in 'Anchorman' and I'm not promoting a show so who would want to pay for me to fly to NYC. I'm nobody." Later, after encouraging words from fans ("The Ladies Man" may not have done well at the box office, but at least one person considers the 2000 movie a classic) and learning the sketch was a last-minute deal, Meadows seemed to have made peace with being left out. "Thanks everyone for all your kind comments. I'm not mad at the show," he shared. "I know what it takes to produce those sketches in a short amount of time. I talked to a friend on the show who said it WAS a last-minute sketch. I acted like a baby. I'm happy for all of my friends' success and will always be grateful and proud to have been a part of 'SNL.' That being said don't forget to see 'Anchorman 2' coming soon to a (theater) near you." CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.
After 10 days stranded far from home, all 52 passengers from a ship stuck in Antarctic ice have now been transferred by helicopter to an Australian icebreaker. "It's 100% we're off! A huge thanks to all," tweeted Chris Turney, an Australian professor among the group of scientists, journalists and tourists marooned on the ship. A helicopter from a nearby Chinese icebreaker ferried passengers Thursday to the Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis. The rescue is the latest chapter in a saga that began Christmas Eve after the Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy got stuck in unusually thick ice. Officials abandoned a succession of other rescue attempts in recent days because of the treacherous conditions in the region. Earlier Thursday, Australian authorities had said a plan involving the helicopter and a barge was put on hold because of shifting ice conditions. But the new approach, which skipped the use of the barge, got under way later in the day. Turney posted videos showing the helicopter arriving on a makeshift helipad on the ice near the trapped ship and taking off into the crisp blue sky. Robert Darvill, chief mate on the Aurora Australis, told CNN that the 52 new passengers on board were very happy to be there and kept thanking the icebreaker's crew for their efforts. "They are on their second dinner of the night right now," he said. Long journey ahead It will still be weeks before the research team makes it to the Australian port of Hobart, said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. "Mid-January is our best guess," Young told reporters on a conference call. The Aurora Australis is still expected to complete a resupply mission to Casey Station, an Australian base in Antarctica, before making its way to Hobart. Darvill said that now all the passengers are on the Aurora Australis, the vessel will try to move out of the heavy pack ice and into more open water. But, he said, they will not set off toward Casey Station until the Rescue Coordination Center of Australia gives them the green light. Darvill also thanked the captain of the Chinese icebreaker whose help made the rescue possible. "Thank you very much for your cooperation. Your crew has done the lion's share of the work and made Australia and much of the world proud," he said. Meanwhile, the master of the Akademik Shokalskiy has decided to keep the 22 Russian crew members on board the stranded ship until the pack ice eventually breaks up and allows it to move again, Young said. The vessel has enough supplies to keep the crew going for "a very long time," he said. The helicopter rescue followed a failed attempt by the Chinese icebreaker, the Xue Long, which made it 6 nautical miles from the trapped vessel before being stopped by especially thick ice. That was followed by an effort by the Australian icebreaker, which was forced Monday to suspend efforts to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The Aurora Australis got within 10 nautical miles of the ship before it turned back. Over the weekend, the maritime agency called off an effort by the French icebreaker Astrolabe. Viral sensations The exploits of the research crew have gone viral, thanks in large part to Twitter and YouTube posts by those aboard the stranded vessel. Turney, the leader of a research expedition on the Akademik Shokalskiy, has tweeted photos of the stranded ship, the crew and penguins, which have stopped by to check out their new neighbors. The group even managed to ring in 2014 with good cheer. "We're the A, A, E who have traveled far, having fun doing science in Antarctica!" a dozen or so of them sang in a video posted on YouTube. "Lots of snow and lots of ice, lots of penguins, which are very, very nice! "Really good food and company, but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here! Ice core, cha cha cha! Ice core, cha cha cha!" The expedition Turney's expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started on December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on Saturday. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turney, a climate change professor at the University of New South Wales, has said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick.
English club Birmingham City have released a statement to explain why co-owner and managing director were interviewed by police in a corruption probe. Birmingham co-owner David Sullivan was interviewed by police on Wednesday night. The Premier League outfit temporarily suspended share trading on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday morning after David Sullivan -- who owns the club with David and Ralph Gold -- was questioned and bailed by officers from City of London's economic crime unit along with MD Karren Brady. The club released a statement on Thursday afternoon to "clarify the situation" before trading resumed at 1300 GMT. "The City of London Police investigation is focusing on payments to a football agent and two players dating back to 2002-03," it said. "There is absolutely no allegation that any director of the company or the club itself has benefited financially from any of this activity. "In so far as there may be any implications for the company, these are not considered material to its financial affairs and they are in relation to the payment, or possible non payment of PAYE and National Insurance contributions.  The club and its directors are co-operating fully with the police in this investigation and will continue to do so." Birmingham was raided by the unit last month as part of an ongoing investigation into corruption in English football. The club said at the time that the inquiries related to an unrelated third party. Birmingham released a statement on Wednesday night confirming that Sullivan and Brady "willingly attended" the interviews "by long-standing appointment." "Birmingham City Football Club is fully committed to helping the police with their inquiries," read a statement on the club's Web site. Police confirmed that they questioned a 59-year-old man and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting and that they were released on bail, the UK Press Association reported on Thursday. A London Stock Exchange statement read: "At the request of the company trading on Aim for the under-mentioned securities has been temporarily suspended from 7.30 a.m., pending an announcement." Shares in the company had been selling for 35.5p until the announcement half an hour before the start of trading, PA reported. Sullivan, 59, was in 2004 named Britain's 68th richest man by the Sunday Times, with assets of more than $1 billion. He made his fortune through pornography and newspapers. Brady, 39, became Britain's youngest managing director when Birmingham floated on the stock market in 1997 and is married to professional footballer Paul Peschisolido. She is also non-executive director of Channel 4, Mothercare and Sport England. PA reported that she made no comment as she left her home in Knowle, Solihull, shortly before 8 a.m. today. Dressed in a dark suit, Brady left the gated property at the wheel of a black 4x4 Porsche.  E-mail to a friend
My son had barely taken his first breath when the people in the hospital started telling me how lucky I was. Not because he was healthy, mind you, but because he was a he. "It's easier to raise boys," I was told. And for a while I actually believed them. Then I started paying attention. Did you know boys are more likely to drop out of high school than girls? Or that there are more female college students than male? And did you know the imprisonment rate for men is roughly 15 times higher than the rate for women? If this is what boys being easier to raise than girls looks like, coul`d you imagine how many men would be in jail if raising girls got any harder? We worry so much about girls getting hurt -- and justifiably so -- but interestingly enough, the stats show it's our boys who are more likely to get robbed, attacked or even murdered. We see girls as fragile orchids and boys as plastic plants. But let's face it: At the core of this line of thinking isn't safety -- it's sex. When someone offers this piece of advice, it's with the thinking that girls have to be protected from boys who will say and do just about anything to get in their pants. What's typically missing from this discussion is the challenge to parents -- particularly fathers -- not to raise a liar and a cheat. True, parents of boys do not  have to worry about them coming home pregnant, but does that mean an unplanned pregnancy can be considered "the girl's problem"? After all, a boy's girlfriend did not get pregnant asexually. That's why I'm Tebowing day and night, hoping my 15-year-old has the will to stay away from sex -- even though the world all around him tells him there's something wrong with him if he does. Easier? Ha. Try different. A little girl who likes to play sports is called a tomboy. A little boy who doesn't like to play sports is called weird. A teen girl who says "no" is called a good girl. A teen boy who says "no" is called a sissy. A lot of words describe what it's like for parents who are trying to teach their teenage son how to be his own man in a high school setting that demands conformity, but "easy" is not one of them. I know, I know, "boys will be boys" is the accepted rule of thumb. But given that we have a federal department that hunts down and sometimes arrests deadbeat fathers, doesn't that raise the question: What kind of boys are we raising? And if they're dropping out of high school at a faster clip than girls, why do we think raising them is easier? Last year, I wrote a piece with the headline "Parents, don't dress your girls like tramps." I received a lot of e-mails from offended readers who told me I had no idea how hard it was to avoid buying sexy clothing for their little princesses. I usually responded by reminding them I never said it wasn't hard. And then I asked if they've ever seen the words on many of the T-shirts aimed at young men. They may not be blatantly inappropriate, like a cut-off shirt that reveals their bellybuttons, but if I had a dollar for every T-shirt I've read that sexualizes the words "balls," "sticks" or "size," I could retire. I guess if parents don't care if their son thinks being a man begins and ends with his penis, then yes, I can see how some would think raising a boy is easier. But if you're actually trying to raise a gentleman, and you hear LMFAO rap "I'm running through these hos like Drano" -- as they do in "Party Rock Anthem," the second most popular song of 2011 -- then you're not breathing a sigh of relief because it's so much easier to raise a boy. Instead you're wondering how much of what you're trying to teach him soaks in, versus what our culture says is OK. We've made so many advances as a society in terms of gender equity, and yet we still hold on to this nonsensical double standard that celebrates sexually active boys while demonizing their female counterparts, as if we can have a lot of one without the other. This kind of thinking is handed down from generation to generation almost as soon as the umbilical cord is cut. But how can we continue to believe boys are easier to raise than girls, when only 42% of custodial moms received all of their child support payments in 2009? Some see loose women in that statistic. I see some men who are punks. Perhaps if we stopped viewing raising our boys as easier, we wouldn't have to deal with so many men who still behave like boys later in life.

The International Olympic Committee has suspended India's Olympic Association over an election for planning to stage an election that was to be contested by just one official who had been accused of corruption. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was due to hold elections on Wednesday in which Lalit Bhanot, who spent 11 months in custody on corruption charges linked to the 2010 Commonwealth Games, but has since been released on bail, had been set to be appointed. Until the suspension is lifted, Indian athletes will not be able to participate in Game events, with the IOA also losing its IOC funding. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) took the decision because of the IOA's "failure to comply with the Olympic Charter and its statures, failure to inform the IOC in a timely matter, and as a protective measure against government interference in the IOA's election process," said the Olympic governing body in a statement. "With this decision, the IOA is no longer entitled to exercise any activity or right, including financial support, conferred upon it by the Olympic Charter or the IOC until the suspension is lifted by the IOC executive board. "In particular, the executive board confirms that the IOA is not entitled to hold any elections until all pending issues are resolved and the EB decides to lift the suspension." The IOA was due to hold elections on Wednesday in which an official accused of corruption relating to the 2010 Commonwealth Games had been set to be appointed. Root and branch reform Indian shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won the country's only individual Olympic gold medalist after his success in the 10m air rifle in Beijing four years ago, called on the IOA to get its "act together". "I think we should take it as an opportunity to try and clean up the system and build an Olympics association that we all can be proud of," Bindra told CNN. "So far the association has not done anything for the development of Olympic sports in India." And sports lawyer Rahul Mehra, who has been campaigning to improve governance within the IOA, welcomed the IOC's action. "I am glad what our government could not do, the IOC has done," said Mehra. "It should have been done two and half years when the Commonwealth Games happened which was the biggest scam this country has ever seen. That was the first wake up call." Mehra also called for root and branch reform of the IOA. "Yes its embarrassing for India, but we need a shakeup, we need a revolution of sorts. Its about transformation in Indian sports, we need new blood, we need new vigor in Indian sports."
(CNN)The flu season is at the midway point, and it's shaping up to be a difficult one, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At a press conference Friday in Atlanta, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the season has been particularly bad for people 65 and older. Frieden also said that five more children have died since the CDC last reported figures, bringing the number of pediatric deaths up to 26 since the flu season began in the fall. The deaths, however, are believed to be higher due to delays in reporting. Adult deaths are not tracked, but the CDC said that the elderly and people with underlying health conditions are vulnerable to this strain of the flu. Frieden advises doctors to treat people who are sick with the flu with anti-viral medications.  Anti-viral medications are dramatically under prescribed and could prevent thousands of hospitalizations and may even save people from death, he said. But pediatrician Lisa Thebner cautions that "not everyone needs antivirals." She said, "They are mostly recommended for those who are most at risk for complications," meaning the very young or old. Frieden said some doctors don't think the medications work, but if given early, they help ease some of the symptoms of the flu. The CDC had predicted the season would be a bad one after most of the samples taken from people with the flu tested positive for the H3N2 strain.  That strain of virus is "nastier," according to Frieden, and generally makes people sicker and results in more hospitalizations and deaths. The CDC reports that most states are seeing widespread cases of flu. In states where the flu season started earlier, it may be slowing down, but there are still weeks of flu left. The flu season usually lasts into the spring. With that in mind, Frieden suggests to go get a flu shot if you haven't been vaccinated. The flu shot this year is not a perfect match for the virus that mutated, but it is the best protection available for people and can lessen the severity of the illness.
Larry Smith's desire to make sure he's alive to watch his grandchildren grow up was his light bulb moment. "I was on the path to not living old and this bothered me," he said. "I want to live long enough to see my young grandkids reach big milestones like graduate from school and get married, or even enjoy simple activities like playing in the yard with them. My grandkids mean the world to me." The 63-year-old epidemiologist from Jackson, Mississippi, recently dropped 58 pounds in a 12-week fitness challenge involving 200 people from the Mississippi governor's office, state legislature workers and civilians. "When they announced I was the winner of the challenge, it was a very emotional experience for me," Smith said. "I've never won any kind of athletic event, and it felt like a huge achievement to do it," he said. Smith, who is 5-foot-10, started the boot camp at 261 pounds and with much hesitation. "During the first day of the program I thought I wouldn't be able to keep up with it because it felt very intimidating and I worried about my weak knees," he said. Smith has struggled with his weight most of his adult life. Before the fitness program, he led a very sedentary lifestyle. He often felt sluggish, lacked energy and felt "miserable." He always dreamed of losing weight, but kept putting it off. "By nature, I think many people are procrastinators, and losing weight was something I always wanted to do but was on my procrastination list," he said. The grandfather of three said an e-mail in his work inbox announcing the "Fit 4 Change Mississippi Fitness Challenge" was the final push he needed to jumpstart his journey toward a healthier lifestyle. "I had known people who participated in the challenge last year and were successful at it, so I thought I'd give it a try," he said. "I thought it would be worth it for both me and my grandkids." The program was led by Mississippian Paul Lacoste, a former pro football player turned fitness coach, with a vision to help slim down the Magnolia State, which has an adult obesity rate of 33% - the highest in the United States. Participants shed a collective 3,043 pounds and 714 inches from their waists by the end of this year's challenge. "The fitness event was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life," Smith said. "Paul worked us really hard during our early morning workout sessions and pushed us to our limits," he said. Weight lifting and various cardiovascular exercises were a major part of the fitness plan. Smith and other participants met four days a week for intense one-hour workouts. Before the challenge started, Smith had high blood pressure, high sugar glucose levels and did not eat well-balanced meals. After he started the fitness challenge, he added healthy food to his diet, such as fruits, vegetables, fish and chicken, and he eliminated fatty foods and red meats. "One of my favorite things to add to food is mayonnaise, but I substituted it with Greek yogurt during the program and this helped me reduce calories," he said. "I'm still eating the yogurt, and enjoy it." Smith said the first few weeks of the program were the most challenging, but after a while he adjusted to his new routine and diet and appreciated the opportunity to get fit. "It took a lot of effort for me to change my lifestyle, but once I started seeing the pounds shed away, it gave me the motivation I needed to keep going," Smith said. Smith said his goal was simply to get in shape, and he never aspired to win the fitness challenge. He was pleasantly surprised when he did. His blood pressure and sugar glucose levels are normal now, and he feels much better since dropping his weight. Since the program has ended, he continues to work out and has dropped eight more pounds. "I just joined the 'Y,' signed up for kick boxing, step and Pilates classes and continue to both walk and run every day," he said. "Paul's program was the jumpstart I needed, and now I am continuing my weight loss journey on my own," he said. Smith said everyone needs to find their own way to a healthy lifestyle and says his best advice is to "just do it," find something you like and don't procrastinate or "wait for tomorrow" like he once did. "I look forward to spending many healthy years into the future with my grandkids, and am glad I am taking the necessary steps to do it," he said.
Oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico further east than previously suspected and at levels toxic to marine life, researchers reported Monday. Initial findings from a new survey of the Gulf conclude that dispersants may have sent the oil to the ocean floor, where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the Florida Panhandle. Plankton and other organisms showed a "strong toxic response" to the crude, according to researchers from the University of South Florida. "The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life," said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at USF. Results of the latest survey are scheduled to be released Tuesday, but CNN obtained a summary of the initial conclusions Monday night. Tests conducted offshore indicate the oil matches the 205-million-gallon Deepwater Horizon spill, which has been temporarily capped for a month, the summary states. Some of it has spread into the DeSoto Canyon, a channel on the ocean floor east of the ruptured well. That canyon comprises part of the spawning grounds for much of the Gulf's commercial fish. "To date, this is the easternmost location for the occurrence of subsurface oils," the report states. The oil is not "draping" across the bottom, but is spread out in "small, unevenly distributed droplets," the report states. USF chemical oceanographer David Hollander said that when an ultraviolet light used to detect oil was turned onto the sea floor, "All of a sudden, it turns out to be a constellation of little dots." And the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later, Paul said. Or it could be eaten by fish and other animals and accumulate in the food chain, Hollander said. "It's in such small droplets that you can see it -- you can filter it and see it," he said. "But if you look at it, it's transparent, and small larval fish see these droplets as food so they're ingesting pure oil." The Environmental Protection Agency has previously reported some oil turning up in the sediment at the bottom of the Gulf, but has not determined whether it came from the Deepwater Horizon spill that erupted in April or whether it was already present. And on August 4, the head of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration warned that oil could persist in the water even though the well has been temporarily capped. The oil company BP used more than 1.8 million gallons of chemical dispersants on the Deepwater Horizon spill between its eruption in late April and the time the well was capped in mid-July. BP says the chemicals allowed the oil to be broken up into droplets small enough that microbes can digest it, and the Environmental Protection Agency has said the dispersants were no more toxic than the oil itself. Critics warned the full effect of the dispersants on the food chain was not known and that their use in deep water effectively concealed the full extent of the spill. NOAA spokeswoman Mary Jane Schramm said on Monday that she had not seen the latest study and couldn't comment on it. BP spokesman John Curry, meanwhile, said the company wants "to know everything everyone wants to know." The company is responsible for capping, cleaning up and compensating victims of the oil spill, and it has committed to spending $500 million to research the spill's impact over the next 10 years. The latest study will "add another piece to the puzzle," Curry said. "There will be others that'll want to look at this study and want to look at doing some additional research," he said. "There's been extensive testing up to this point, and I'm sure there will be much more going forward." CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.
The million-plus U.S. adults who take medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) do not appear to be increasing their risk of heart attack or stroke, as some experts have feared, according to a new study published today on the website of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Stimulant medications -- a class that includes Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta, and their generic versions -- and the non-stimulant drug Strattera have all been shown to slightly raise blood pressure and heart rate, which can contribute to heart problems. Researchers haven't conclusively linked these side effects to heart attacks, strokes, or sudden death from heart-related causes, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received numerous reports of these and other heart problems in people taking stimulants for ADHD. In 2006, the FDA ordered stimulant manufacturers to add warnings about potential heart risks to their product labels, although the agency stopped short of requiring the so-called black box warning an advisory panel had recommended. Health.com: 15 signs you may have adult ADHD The new study, which was funded and partly overseen by the FDA and other federal health agencies, is the largest of its kind to date and seems to bear out the FDA's decision to opt for a milder label warning. Researchers at several large health insurers across the nation analyzed the medical and pharmacy records of 443,198 people between the ages of 25 and 64, roughly one-third of whom had filled prescriptions for stimulants or Strattera. After controlling for other factors that can increase cardiovascular risk (such as smoking), the authors found no increase in heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac death rates among people who were currently using an ADHD drug. Nor did they find any differences in cardiovascular risk among people who had taken ADHD medications in the past and those taking them currently. Health.com: The worst habits for your heart Although the findings should allay the fears of people taking these medications, the study doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of small increases in heart risk, says lead author Laurel Habel, Ph.D., a research scientist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, in Oakland, Calif. "Our study suggests that these drugs are not associated with a markedly elevated risk, but we can't say that they're completely safe," Habel says. "It makes sense for patients and doctors to talk about the potential risks." The study had several limitations that prevent firmer conclusions about the drugs' safety. The researchers couldn't confirm that the participants actually consumed the prescriptions they filled, for instance, and they followed the participants for an average of just 16 months. "That's not a very long time for looking at cardiovascular risk, because cardiovascular risk extends over many years," says Robert Myerburg, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks And despite being very large, the study may not have been big enough to detect small increases in risk, since heart attacks and other serious cardiovascular problems are relatively rare, says Philip Shaw, M.D., an ADHD researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Indeed, only 2,228 of the study participants -- one-half of 1% -- experienced a heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac death. More than 1.5 million adults in the United States take stimulants, according to the study. Most take the drugs for ADHD, although doctors sometimes prescribe stimulants off-label for depression-related fatigue, narcolepsy, and other conditions. Health.com: Adult ADHD? Tips for increasing your focus Although children with ADHD have received the lion's share of attention from researchers and public-health officials, adults accounted for one-third of all prescriptions for ADHD medications in 2005. A previous study by the same group of researchers found no link between ADHD drugs and serious cardiovascular events in children and young adults, Shaw notes in his editorial. People who take ADHD medications should continue to be aware of less serious side effects, such as insomnia and loss of appetite, Shaw says. But, he says, the study is "very reassuring" regarding cardiovascular risk. Copyright Health Magazine 2011
(CNN)Sorry, ladies, but he put a ring on it. The trailer for "Ted 2" came out Thursday, and it's everything you probably imagined. The film is the sequel to Seth MacFarlane's very successful 2012 film about a foul-mouthed teddy bear. "The Family Guy" creator once again wrote and directed. This time around, the stuffed animal is getting married, trying to legally prove that he's human and attempting to have a baby via a sperm donation from his best friend, played by Mark Wahlberg. Yes, that's a lot, we know. The trailer is deemed appropriate for "approved audiences" and is definitely not for those who are adverse to butt crack humor. In addition to Wahlberg and MacFarlane (who voices Ted), the film stars Amanda Seyfried and Morgan Freeman. "Ted 2" will be in theaters June 26.
African-American workers at a Texas pipe factory endured a string of racial slurs and harassment and were targeted by their managers when they complained, federal investigators have determined. Black employees at the Turner Industries plant in Paris, Texas, regularly "were subjected to unwelcome racial slurs, comments and intimidation, racial graffiti, nooses in the workplace and other symbols of discrimination," the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported. Black workers also were denied promotions and disciplined more harshly than whites, the agency concluded in a three-page letter in late March. Managers at the plant not only were aware of a "hostile environment," they also targeted workers who complained and disciplined white employees who opposed the harassment, the EEOC found. The EEOC has called on Turner Industries, based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to join talks aimed at producing a "just resolution" to the problems. The company said its plant "is free from any form of discrimination, retaliation, or any other workplace conduct that violates the law." "We are disappointed that the EEOC has issued this determination and strongly disagree with the EEOC's findings," Michael Phelps, Turner Industries' vice president for human resources, said in a written statement. Lawyers for the seven Turner employees who went to the EEOC displayed photographs of the slurs, of hanging nooses and threatening notes left for employees at the Paris plant during a news conference Wednesday. One of those employees, Dontrail Mathis, told reporters that he was frequently called racially inflammatory names and that most African-American employees were relegated to the paint shop. Mathis, a painter's helper, said one co-worker who found out he was married to a white woman told him, "In the Bible, it says that white women shouldn't mix with monkeys." When he called Turner's corporate office to complain about that incident, he heard nothing back, Mathis said. "I tried to back away from it. It kept going and going and coming and coming," he said. Jason Milligan, a former night foreman at the plant, said his bosses "more or less wanted me to do their dirty work." "I watched certain people more than I did the others, to see if I could get anything on them that could be used against them," he said. But he said he was fired after he refused to sign an affidavit accusing a Turner employee of theft -- a man he believed had been "set up." "I'm not going to lie for anyone," Milligan said. "He was a man just like me. He has a family to take care of. I'm not going to do it. And from then on, that was my down-slide." Milligan worked at the plant for nine months before he was fired. Company officials told him he was sacked for failing a drug test, he said. But a lawyer for the employees, Jay Ellwanger, said Milligan warned testers that he was taking a diet medication that could show up as a stimulant. Milligan said managers were told to document and clean off any racist graffiti immediately, but he said one such case he handled in his nine months at the plant was "swept under the rug" when the person behind it turned out to be a relative of another manager. In the year since workers in the Paris plant went to the EEOC, similar complaints have emerged at other Turner factories in Texas, Ellwanger said. Paris is about 110 miles northeast of Dallas. The Rev. Peter Johnson, a state civil rights leader, said the problems reported at the Turner plant reflect a "culture of discrimination" that lingers in East Texas. "East Texas is Mississippi 50 years ago. This case will begin to help us unravel the history of discrimination and bigotry throughout East Texas," he said. CNN's Tracy Sabo and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.
For actress Kyra Sedgwick, it's the public's approval that makes it worth being away from her family for six months to tape her critically acclaimed series "The Closer." Kyra Sedgwick and her husband, Kevin Bacon, at the 66th annual Golden Globe Awards this month. But she may be getting more approval from her peers, too. Sedgwick will walk the red carpet again Sunday night at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where she is nominated for a fourth consecutive year for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for her role as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. She's also won a Golden Globe for her performance, in 2007. The TNT series resumes Monday night where it left off in September with what Sedgwick called "a fantastic five episodes." (TNT is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) "I said to the writers, 'I really want a lot of personal stuff for Brenda,' " Sedgwick said. "I feel like there's some of those personal quiet moments with her alone, is something that I've been missing as an actor, and I feel like the audience has been missing, too. "She is such a complicated, fascinating character, and watching her growth and lack of growth is something that is really interesting," she said. When CNN asked whether the new episodes might include a wedding for her character, Sedgwick laughed. "That might very well happen," she said. "That's pretty insightful of you. I'm just going to just say that." A marriage for Brenda Johnson would be "a complicated, difficult situation," she said, because "she's basically married to her work." Sedgwick's job also complicates her real-life marriage to Bacon, since the show is produced in Los Angeles and the couple lives in Connecticut with their two children. That's where the approval -- whether on the street from fans or at award shows -- has "been a wonderful phenomenon for me," she said. "On a personal level, that's really good for me, because I really miss my family when I'm working on the show six months in L.A.," she said. "As much as I try to get my kids to move to L.A. and my husband, they just wouldn't have it. "It's challenging, and I'm glad that people are watching, because otherwise it would be kind of hard to go to work," Sedgwick said. Sedgwick has moved into an executive producer's role on the show, which she said she expects to continue for at least two more years. "I love being with a group where there's not a power struggle," she said. "I have a lot of say, and I always have. And that feels really good." CNN Radio's Jackie Howard contributed to this report
Pan Am families with TWA families. A few months later, ACCESS was born. ACCESS, short for AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services, is a nonprofit bereavement support program for people who have lost loved ones in aviation disasters. "We have 250 grief mentors from air disasters dating back to 1958 -- private, military and commercial air disasters," Snow said. "This gives people an opportunity to share what they went through with somebody else and also provide hope for them." Most of the trained grief mentors have called in for help in the past, Snow said. Rachel Courtney is one of them. Courtney lost her father, James Courtney, along with his legal assistant in a private plane crash in 1998. "For a period of three weeks, we were searching for him in the woods," Courtney said. "The first night I was home, we were all in a small airport...I thought he's probably cold and in the woods and that nobody's helping him. And I was completely panicked." A year later, Courtney was still grappling with the loss. "I realized that the world was moving on but in a lot of respects, I wasn't," she said. "Heidi ended up pairing me up with another woman who was a mentor, who had lost her father in an aircraft disaster." Courtney's experience inspired her to help others. "To me, it was 'I got through this,'" she said. "I wanted to be there to help other people see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel." When planes go down, like AirAsia Flight 8501, which left 162 people dead in December, Snow and her team of grief mentors stand by ready to help. "Every time we have the opportunity to speak about ACCESS on the news...We get calls for help from people who have lost loved ones who didn't know we were there," she said. Snow appeared on several CNN shows after the AirAsia crash. "Every time these incidents occur we are walking with them, we remember, we are grieving with them," Snow told Michaela Pereira on CNN's "New Day." In addition to providing one-on-one support, the organization shares information with airlines and organizations to help them offer more effective emotional support after these types of losses. Snow also wrote the book "Surviving Sudden Loss: Stories from those who have lived it" as another tool families could use to deal with their grief. "This is a lifelong journey. ... I feel so blessed that I've been given the opportunity to be with these incredible people who come forward and volunteer their time," Snow said. "They really look at life differently because they start to realize how precious it is and how life can change in an instant."
Graeme Le Saux played more than 400 matches for Blackburn, Chelsea and Southampton, winning a Premier League title and 36 international caps. CNN's Don Riddell talks to the former England star about homophobia and racism in the game. Graeme Le Saux, pictured here playing for Chelsea, endured homophobic abuse throughout his career due to false rumors he was gay. Don Riddell: Graeme, you're happily married with two children but during your football career everyone thought you were gay and the experience was pretty miserable. Graeme Le Saux: The culture of football back in the 80s was very different, something I found very hard to relate to and subsequently I found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people. That eventually led to rumors being spread that I was gay. In the context of modern life that's not defamatory but in terms of the dressing room culture that existed then -- and to an extent now -- it was very difficult for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career. I think that the joke very quickly got out of hand. And I think where I was at fault was that I was probably a little sensitive about it, because I could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control. And it did. We played in a game at West Ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and I remember being, you know, really, really shocked that it got to that level so quickly. DR: And that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving Robbie Fowler. Tell me about that? GS: It all culminated in a game that we played at Stamford Bridge against Liverpool and Robbie Fowler, he stood in front of 40,000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him... That's the politest way I can put it! That really was the point at which it couldn't get any worse. It wasn't just people singing on the terrace, it was a colleague -- an international colleague -- humiliating you in front of all those people, an international audience. He will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point. If you look at anything like this, whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever, as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue. I'm all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you can't hide behind that as an excuse. DR: It's thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay. That was the Englishman Justin Fashanu and he committed suicide a decade ago. John Amaechi became the first gay player to be associated with the NBA last year, but such declarations are extremely rare. In many cases homosexuality remains pro sport's last taboo. GS: It's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport. If you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics, across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still isn't and I find that disappointing. There may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment. DR: Football's obviously made great strides, certainly in Britain, in the last 10 years with regards to racism, but how much prejudice is there generally in the game? Do you think we'll ever be free of it? GS: I think there's always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice. But ultimately I think it's important for any business really to be responsible, inclusive and representative of its employees. And football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example. And so I hope that, you know, the people in authority really make some serious attempts, I suppose to create parity between all walks of life. DR: We've come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse aren't really racist, they are just trying to put us off our game. How much do you buy into that approach? GS: Well, I can't speak for individual black players! But sometimes I think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual. It used to baffle me when I first started playing that you'd have Chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the Chelsea's team. And if you spoke to them or confronted them about it, they would be like, "Oh yeah, but we know them... they are, you know, they are fine." And it's like, well how do you pick the bones out of that? Because there is just no logic. But then you know prejudice is built on ignorance. You know it really is. I think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say, "Well, would I like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse?"
Thirty-four vehicles, including four semi-trailer trucks, were involved in a chain-reaction pile-up Monday morning in Colorado that temporarily shut down a major highway and sent 12 people to area hospitals, state police said. The massive accident occurred on Interstate 25 northbound in Larkspur, about 40 miles south of Denver and 30 miles north of Colorado Springs, Colorado, State Patrol Trooper Nate Reid told CNN. None of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening, according to Reid. He added that road conditions were icy and wet at the time of the accident. Motorist Brad Simpson told CNN affiliate KOAA, "It was just really bad snow, it was something where a lot of people were driving way too fast for the conditions." Authorities used school buses to move people who were not injured but were stuck on the highway. They were taken to a shelter at the New Covenant Church in Larkspur, authorities told CNN affiliate KUSA. The accident prompted police to close the highway northbound. Several CNN affiliates, including KMGH and KWGN, reported that one lane reopened around noon and traffic was moving through all lanes by 12:45 p.m. -- about four hours after the accident happened. CNN's Frances Causey contributed to this report.
For Angel Rojas, the daily bus ride through the streets of Brooklyn provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low-paying jobs. "It was his time to relax," his wife's cousin, Josie Guerrero, said Saturday. "His time to take the load off. He usually listened to music or talked on the phone. It was a few minutes of calmness." That peace was shattered Thursday evening as Rojas shuttled between jobs, hoping to make a quick stop at home to see his wife and two children. It was his final bus trip. A young man boarded the bus, police said. In the rear, a 14-year-old boy police described as a member of a street gang called the Stack Money Goons allegedly spotted a member of a rival gang and pulled out a .357-caliber revolver. Shots were fired, the bullets missing the intended target, police said. Rojas, 39, was hit in the head and declared dead later at a hospital near where his bus trip began. "Pretty big gun for a pretty small man," Police Commissioner William Bratton said of the suspected gunman. On Friday, Kathon Anderson was charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon, according to the Brooklyn district attorney's office. He is to be tried as an adult. "Just as everyone in New York probably feels terrible about it, we feel terrible about it too," Anderson's lawyer, Frederic Pratt, told reporters, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. "I'm just going to ask everyone not to rush to judgment." Anderson allegedly belonged to Stack Money Goons and targeted a rival from another group known as TWAN Family, police said. "The stupidity of those gangs that basically, over nothing, are trying to kill each other and, unfortunately, in the process, kill innocents as they did with this hard working young man trying to raise his family," Bratton said. "A life needlessly lost, taken by a 14-year-old who felt it necessary to carry a gun on a city bus and shoot it." On Saturday, Rojas' wife was raising money for a wake and to fly her husband's body home to his native Dominican Republic. "He was the sole provider," Guerrero said. "She never thought she would have to bury her husband and raise the children alone." The couple has two children: a 12-year-old son, Saury, and 8-year-old daughter, April. "Why he did that to my dad?" Saury asked, according to WCBS. Guerrero said, "He was just sitting on a bus. He had nothing to do with this." Angel Rojas and his wife came to New York from the Dominican Republic about five years ago, Guerrero said. She held occasional part-time jobs; he stocked shelves at two Brooklyn bodegas. "He was a hard worker and a family man devoted to giving his family a better life," Guerrero said. "He was the funniest man you would ever meet. Everyone loved him. His laughter and his presence stayed with you." Mother loses both children in same month New Testament stops bullets, saves man
Will you be any worse off the moment humans cease to speak in Aragonese? How about Navajo, or Ojibwa? Or Koro, a language only just discovered in a tiny corner of northeast India? No, you probably wouldn't, not in that moment. But humanity would be. Science, art and culture would be. If, as the phrase goes, another language equals another soul, then some 3,054 souls -- 50% of the world's total languages -- are set to die out by 2100. Mashable.com: Kindle Espanol: Amazon launches Spanish-language ebook store If there is hope, it lies in the world's centers of information -- such as Google.

The young seamstress who survived 17 days in the rubble of a collapsed factory building got a new job Thursday -- a five-star hotel said it had hired her as its "public area ambassador." "We are proud to have her on board with us. I hope we can together create a good future and career for this young woman," Westin Dhaka Hotel General Manager Azeem Shah said of 19-year-old Reshma. Like many women in Bangladesh, she goes goes by one name. Reshma had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since her rescue on May 10, and she accepted the new job in the housekeeping department of the Starwood Hotels and Resorts facility when she was released Thursday. "I am really happy to join here," Reshma told reporters at the hotel, where she met with media. Reshma surprised searchers and workers clearing rubble at the collapsed Rana Plaza building when she cried out for help in a faint voice more than two weeks after the nine-story structure fell, killing 1,130 people and injuring more than 2,400. Rescuers pulled her from a dark chamber under remnants of the factory where she had worked as a sewing-machine operator. She said she survived on some water in a bottle she found and four crackers. "The people who were with me under the rubble died. I heard people screaming. 'Save me, save me,' they screamed. But I couldn't find them. I tried," Reshma said after her rescue. Five apparel factories at Rana Plaza made clothes for various brands, including British discount fashion retailer Primark and Canada's Loblaw Cos Ltd as well as Spanish retailer Mango.
"The people who survived the Great Depression were the ones who had money to buy when everybody else was selling." -- My grandfather I learned a lot from my grandfather, but that might have been the greatest lesson he ever taught me. He wasn't just talking about managing money, he was talking about managing life -- and his words have stuck with me since I was a child. A few years back, I was taking a theology course and the professor recommended only the books whose authors he agreed with. I read those books, but I also asked that professor which books he thought had it completely wrong -- and I read those too. Then I made up my own mind. After all, following the herd is fine until they all run off the side of a cliff together. Less than a year ago, a recession was the last thing on anyone's mind. In fact, over the summer, as I was questioning the conventional wisdom, I read an article on my television show that quoted a financial expert as saying, "It is the strongest global market that we've seen in the history of measuring these things." That's when I realized how fast the herd was approaching the cliff. But with predictions of a recession now more common than Fed rate cuts -- and that's saying something -- maybe now it's time to look at a worst-case scenario. After all, considering all sides of an issue, no matter how extreme they may be, doesn't make you a crazy person; it makes you an educated one. So to understand what a real meltdown could look like, I turned to Nouriel Roubini, chairman of RGE Monitor and professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business. He's also a former adviser to the U.S. Treasury Department. Professor Roubini recently laid out what he called the "12 steps to financial disaster." Unfortunately, they were really complicated, and I have severe ADD, so I've boiled them down into five phases that even a rodeo clown like me can understand. I think of these like our military's "DEFCON" -- or defense readiness condition -- scale, except that this countdown could end in the meltdown of your bank account: • DEFCONOMY FIVE How you'll know we're here: The housing downturn turns into a free fall, making it the worst collapse in our country's history. That not only triggers massive numbers of foreclosures and lost household wealth, but it also sets off another large wave of bank write-downs. Odds we get here:  Roubini told me that it's "extremely likely, even unavoidable" that we hit this stage because "the excess supply of new homes in the market is like we've never seen before." Prices, he believes, "need to fall another 10 to 20 percent before that clears." • DEFCONOMY FOUR How you'll know we're here: Americans upside-down on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt, like credit cards, car loans and student loans. In addition, bond insurance companies lose their perfect credit ratings, forcing already troubled banks to write down another $150 billion. Odds we get here: High. Roubini says that 8 million households are already upside-down on their mortgages and he thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million  and 24 million by the end of 2009. A lot of those people, he believes, will simply walk away from their homes and send their keys back to the bank. • DEFCONOMY THREE How you'll know we're here:  Some banks begin to crack under the pressure of continuing write-downs and mounting defaults by consumers. A national or large regional bank finally collapses, triggering hedge fund failures and general chaos on Wall Street, potentially leading to a 1987-style market crash. Odds we get here:  Very good. Roubini says that we'll likely socialize the losses, "effectively nationalizing the mortgages or the banks." It would be, he told me, "like Northern Rock (the large bank in England that was recently taken over by the British government) times three." He thinks the stock market will head south throughout the year as fears about a severe recession are confirmed. • DEFCONOMY TWO How you'll know we're here:  Most forms of credit (both to consumers and businesses) become virtually nonexistent. That results in a "vicious circle" of additional write-downs, stock market losses, and bank collapses, which leads to even less credit being available. Odds we get here:  Good. Roubini says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and won't be getting better anytime soon. Without extra credit available, people might have to actually (gasp!) live within their means. • DEFCONOMY ONE How you'll know we're here:  Welcome back to 1929. A full economic meltdown results in a complete failure of the underlying financial system. What will be known to future generations as "The Greater Depression" has arrived. Odds we get here: Not likely. Roubini believes that this will be a "very painful and severe recession" that could last for 18 months or more, but it will be more like 1981 than 1929. Families may be eating soup again, but at least it'll be in their own kitchens. Now, do I think any of what you just read will happen? I have no idea, and that's exactly the problem. I'm not an economist or a stockbroker; I'm just a guy trying to make the best decisions I can, and picking the brains of real experts helps me do that. But I do know one thing for sure: Depressions aren't advertised in advance. Last time around we went from the Roaring '20s to bread lines in a matter of just a few years. Anyone who says that can't happen again either doesn't know history, doesn't understand how interconnected the world's economies have become, or is lying to you. While that doesn't mean you should panic, it does mean you should prepare -- something my grandfather would've done a long time ago. E-mail to a friend
The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs. Quick sailor: French trimaran l'Hydroptere is one of the boats battling for the outright world sailing speed record. The outright world sailing speed record -- which did not change hands for 11 years after 1993 -- has been bettered four times this year alone. The new holder of the record, Alexandre Caizergues, of France, claimed it with an average speed of 50.57 knots (almost 60 miles per hour) over 500 meters on his kite board off the coast of Namibia last month. Caizergues' attempt was eventually ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) this month, when it was decided that kite boards would be eligible for the outright record. Meanwhile, another Frenchman, Alain Thebault, has also been closely challenging for the record on his vessel l'Hydroptere. Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category. Then there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French . Paul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots. Larsen achieved the speed in 22 knot winds, and shortly before his unusual "boat" became airborne and flipped. Larsen's speed is just awaiting formal approval from the WSSRC. Thebault held the record with a speed of 46.88 knots. Even the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race has had a speed record of its own with current leader Ericsson 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24-hour period during the event's first leg. According to a spokesman from the WSSRC, interest in speed sailing is steadily building, and the close competition has been giving it a boost. "Certainly towards the end of the year it's been very hectic. I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues. The development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records. "The fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records," the spokesman said. He said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work. "It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right," he said. The spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008. He said the council's job was not to promote the attempts but simply to oversee them in a fair and independent manner and ratify successful efforts. The WSSRC had a number of commissioners based around the world, he said.
The sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, lashed out Thursday at Justice Department officials, calling their civil lawsuit alleging civil rights violations against him and his county politically motivated. "They're using me for the Latino vote, showing that they're doing something, taking on the sheriff over an alleged racial profiling," Joe Arpaio told reporters in Phoenix. He vowed to defend himself, not for selfish purposes, but to help the thousands of other sheriffs in the country avoid finding themselves in similar situations. "I'm not going to surrender my office to the federal government," he said. "I will fight this to the bitter end." Arpaio rejected the Department of Justice's call for monitors to oversee the workings of his department. "That shows you they want to take over this office," he said. "Under this agreement with the so-called monitor, I'd probably have to clear every press release before I go public, especially having to do with illegal immigration, with the Department of Justice." Arpaio's remarks came hours after the Justice Department filed the civil lawsuit. "At its core, this is an abuse-of-power case involving a sheriff and sheriff's office that disregarded the Constitution, ignored sound police practices, compromised public safety, and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez. The Justice Department had delivered in December a report with findings of civil rights violations and sought to fix them through a negotiated settlement with Maricopa County and its sheriff's office. Those talks broke down in February over Maricopa's refusal to consider any agreement that involved an independent monitor, Perez said. "Attempts to forge solutions to address the serious civil rights and public safety concerns have proven elusive," Perez said. According to the civil complaint, the sheriff's office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against Latinos, which includes racial profiling, unlawful detention and searches, and unlawful targeting of Latinos during raids. The complaint also alleges that Maricopa detention officers discriminated against Latino prisoners in the jail. The targets were often prisoners who don't speak English well, Perez said. The jailers would give orders only in English, and when the prisoners didn't understand, they would place an entire area of the jail on lockdown for disobedience. "This incites obvious and unwarranted hostility toward the inmates, potentially placing prisoners and officers alike in harm's way," Perez said. Finally, the complaint recounts a number of cases in which Arpaio and his office allegedly retaliated against perceived enemies. These included judges, lawyers and community leaders who were critical, or perceived to be critical of Maricopa policies. "Nobody is above the law, and nobody can misuse the legal process to silence those with different opinions," Perez said. "Leadership starts at the top, and all of the alleged violations outlined in the complaint are the product of a culture of disregard for basic rights within MCSO that starts at the top and pervades the organization." The December letter said detention officers in Arpaio's jail invoked slurs and profanities against Latinos, calling them "wetbacks," "Mexican bitches" and "stupid Mexicans." Arpaio has denied any discrimination, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a "witch hunt."
As residents of Toledo, Ohio, waited for word on when their water will be safe to drink, Mayor D. Michael Collins said Sunday morning that tests of the water supply were going to take longer than expected. He said results would likely be available Sunday afternoon but would not provide a specific timeline. As many as 400,000 people were told not to consume, cook with or even boil the tap water, after a toxin called microcystin was found in the water supply late Friday. Collins told reporters the advisories will remain in effect until at least Sunday evening. He said test results so far are "trending in a very positive direction." The tests are being done by the Environmental Protection Agency. Toledo's drinking water comes from Lake Erie, where a harmful algae bloom that causes microcystin has been growing, according to a city spokeswoman. Several locations around the city have been designated as distribution centers for potable water, where members of the Ohio National Guard, fire officials and other first responders are giving out safe water. About 350 Ohio National Guardsmen have been activated by the governor, according to a U.S. Defense Department official, adding that they have set up three Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit sites at two high schools and a police facility. The guardsmen have also delivered ready-to-eat meals, the official said. Lining up for water On Sunday, at least one Toledo restaurant was open, despite the water issues. The Claddagh Irish Pub brought in about 400 gallons of water from Michigan, according to Janeil Mesteller, the area director for Northwest Ohio Claddagh Irish Pubs. According to Mesteller, the 400 gallons are for cleaning and the pub now has cases of bottled water also. The pub will do whatever it takes to stay open and serve customers, she said. They're using disposable plastic plates and are "feeding anyone who wants to be fed," Mesteller said. Saturday morning, a line formed outside Walt Churchill's Market & Pharmacy in Perrysburg, Ohio, before the business even opened. Toledo-area residents, desperate for clean water, bought all the bottled water inside, market co-owner Bob Carpenter said. Then, hearing that a water tank truck full of about 8,000 gallons had set up outside the store, more people descended on the oasis with empty jugs they could fill for $1 a gallon. About two-thirds of the Toledo area population is affected by the water warning. Ohio Gov. John Kasich issued a state of emergency for Fulton, Lucas and Wood counties. The potential contamination also affects four municipalities in Michigan, CNN affiliate WXYZ reported. There are no reports of anyone getting sick from the water, officials said. Harmful algal blooms When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, algae can reproduce rapidly, forming a dense population known as a "bloom," according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Testing is crucial because NOAA says it can't determine just from images whether blooms are toxic. Ingestion of the toxin can affect the liver and cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and even acute liver failure, according to NOAA. But the Ohio state emergency management agency said it is safe for adults to shower and for everyone to wash their hands. CNN's David Shortell, Ryan Sloane, Barbara Starr, Marisa Marcellino, Donovan Long and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.
Former Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase was placed on three years of probation Friday in a corruption case that had been under investigation for more than six years. Romania's Supreme Court found Nastase guilty of committing blackmail while he was prime minister, from 2000 to 2004. He also had been accused of bribery, but the court found him innocent on that charge. Nastase had denied all the charges in the case and said the trial was a political one, ordered by Romania's current president, Traian Basescu, who defeated Nastase when the two ran for president in 2004. Nastase's lawyer, Ion Cazacu, said he might appeal the decision. Nastase's wife also was placed on three years of probation for using false documents. She was found innocent on other charges, including bribery. The trial of Nastase and his wife started in 2010 after Romania's Anti-corruption Agency accused them of bribery and blackmail. Another main figure in the case was Irina Jianu, former head of a state construction agency, who was found innocent on charges of money laundry and bribery. However, the court found her guilty of using false documents, and she was sentenced to three years in prison. During the trial, the Anti-corruption Agency stated that Nastase received directly or through his wife â‚¬630,000 ($840,000) from Jianu while he was a prime minister. In return, the agency said, Nastase named Jianu as head of the construction agency. According to the prosecutors, the money was used by Nastase to buy objects and goods from China and to cover the cost of some work done at two of his houses, in Bucharest and Cornu. The Supreme Court found Nastase and his wife innocent regarding these accusations. The anti-corruption agency also said Nastase sent almost â‚¬90,000 ($120,000) to Ioan Paun, who was then a Romanian consul-general in China. The agency said the money was meant to be used in China for the purchase of various goods and objects for the Nastase family. This was the second conviction for Nastase this year. In January, he was sentenced to two years of prison in what was known as the Quality Trophy corruption case. He has appealed that decision. In that case, the Romanian Supreme Court found Nastase guilty of illegally raising â‚¬1.6 million ($2.1 million) during his 2004 campaign for president as the candidate of the Social Democrat Party. Nastase was also involved in another case, known as the Aunt Tamara case, in which he was accused of paying a $400,000 bribe to the former head of the country's anti-money-laundering agency to delete some documents related to his wife's bank account. Nastase was found innocent in that case. Nastase was the first former prime minister and the highest official to get a jail sentence in Romania since the fall of communism. The European Union has repeatedly called on Romania to put more effort into tackling corruption by top-level officials and politicians.
The cast of the upcoming film "X-Men: Days of Future Past" made a surprise appearance at Comic-Con this afternoon along with director Bryan Singer. The cast members who appeared include those from the original "X-Men" movie franchise and those from 2011's X-Men reboot "X:Men: First Class." Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James McEvoy, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Jackman, Evan Peters, Shawn Ashmore and Omar Sy assembled in Hall H to debut footage from the film. Dinklage has been rumored to be playing the villain in the film since photos from the set leaked earlier this summer, but at first the "Game of Thrones" actor wouldn't confirm his role. "I'm playing Mystique," he joked. He later officially confirmed his participation by saying, "I get to play Bolivar Trask." Singer directed 2000's "X-Men" and 2003's "X2," and produced 2009's "X-Men Origins: Wolverine." The director set up this new film in the series, which will be released in theaters on May 23, 2014, explaining the character of Wolverine (Jackman) will be the central figure bringing the story together. The upcoming "Wolverine" film out next week will act as a bridge for the character, Jackman said. Another can of "Kick-Ass" "The goal was to try and make a film that would bring this cast together by time travel or time displacement of some kind," Singer said. "Basically, the notion is that consciousness of Wolverine of the future is sent into his past self. And it was nice because Hugh was able to play both parts because the character of Wolverine is ageless. And it was great to be able to place him as a character in both these worlds. For me, it was great to reunite the old cast and get to work as a director with the new cast." Singer also addressed rumors that this new film will rewrite the movie universe he's set up in prior films, specifically changing some of the events from "X2." "Whenever you're going back in time -- and this is every bit as much a time travel movie as it is an X-Men movie -- there is those risks," Singer said. "I'm not the audience, I'm just the filmmaker, but I do believe in certain continuity that we'll maintain and some things we'll change. When you go back and mess about, things happen. So some of those rumors are probably somewhat true." Superman vs. Batman, friends or foes? There will be some interaction between the older and younger versions of the characters, according to Singer. The director screened a reel of film footage that included a teaser of that. "Wolverine is the journeyman," Singer said. "His interaction with the younger cast is primary. There is a moment, which you'll see in this reel, where these characters come face to face, older self with younger self. And we tried to do it in a unique way. It's been done before, but with my first opportunity to make a time travel film I want to create this set of rules and stay with them." One of the big surprises is that Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) is still alive after the events of 2006's "X-Men: The Last Stand." In that film, the character of Jean Grey killed Xavier -- mostly. Metallica promotes new film "My assumption was that it was going to be Ian and Halle and Hugh and everybody back, but it won't be me," Stewart said. "But something happened, which I'm not allowed to talk about -- am I?" In my own mind I understand how Xavier is alive at the end of 'X-Men 3,'" Singer responded. "At the end of 'X-Men 3' after the credits when his consciousness is inside of this woman in a hospital and you take that and mix it with some powerful mutants -- mutants can do a lot of cool stuff -- you can imagine that anything is possible." The film takes place during several time periods, including the 1970s, which allowed for some interesting costume choices beyond the X-Men suits. "I personally love the moments when I get to wear the '70s clothes," said Lawrence, who (really) plays Mystique. "I really enjoy them because I love that time and I like wearing clothes when I can. Some of the Mystique stuff, some of the look is a little bit different. We're still using the same paint. When we left the (last) movie, she was mutant and proud. She was kind of struggling with the problem that a lot of normal human people struggle with, which is how they look. So she was very covered up in the first movie, but this time she is mutant and proud." "It's a very collaborative thing," Fassbender added. "That's a thing that I've found as a whole: The clothes we wear, the Magneto outfit, being on set." "The best thing about playing the older Magneto this time -- no helmet," McKellen said, telling Fassbender, "We'll talk about helmets later." The cast members also discussed their ongoing friendships. One of the benefits of the film was bringing the original cast members back together and for Berry, who plays Storm, this film was a chance to reunite with old friends. "We all love the films, but what's nice for me is that in the first movie we all became such good friends," Berry said. "And we really like each other and we like being around each other so to have a chance to do the work and hang out with the people we really respect, admire and like to be around is the joy of coming back to do these movies. The beauty is we pick up as if we just saw each other yesterday. I was really happy to see everybody and meet the new cast."
Jury selection begins Thursday for an Army sergeant charged in what military authorities say was a conspiracy by a group of soldiers to kill Afghan civilians for sport and then cover it up. Sgt. Darren Jones is one of 12 soldiers, all members of the Washington-based 5th Stryker Combat Brigade, accused in a case that strained U.S. relations with Afghanistan after details emerged that some of the soldiers allegedly posed with dead Afghans and collected souvenirs from the killings. Jones is one of six soldiers facing trial and the only one not charged with killing Afghans. Six other soldiers, including one who posed for photos with a dead Afghan, have accepted plea deals. Jones, who faces courts-martial at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and conspiracy to commit assault and battery. The government maintains that sometime in March 2010, Jones along with other soldiers opened fire on three Afghan men near Forward Operating Base Ramrod, in the volatile Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan. The Army charge sheet, which spells out the allegations against Jones, does not provide the date of the shooting, the identities of the victims or whether they were wounded. There is no evidence Jones killed or wounded any Afghan civilians, his lawyer, Kevin McDermott, told CNN late Wednesday "They're calling it aggravated assault, even though he didn't hit anybody," McDermott said. "There is no forensic evidence, no ballistic, no bodies, no identities." A telephone call by CNN late Wednesday to the prosecutor's office at Joint Base Lewis-McChord went unanswered. The military also alleges that Jones, 30, of Brea, California, joined others in his unit in the May 2010 beating of a fellow soldier to prevent him from talking to investigators about the killings and other misconduct at the base in southern Afghanistan. McDermott said Jones was never interviewed by military investigators about his alleged role. The government alleges the killing-for-sport plan was hatched by Staff Sgt. Calvin R. Gibbs, 25, of Billings, Montana, and that the group began killing civilians in January 2010. The case drew international outrage in March when Der Spiegel, a German news magazine, published photos that showed two of the accused -- Spec. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes -- posing over dead bodies of Afghans. The U.S. Army apologized for any distress caused by the photos, calling the photographs "repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards and values of the United States Army." Army officials asserted in the statement that ongoing court-martial proceedings related to the alleged atrocities "speak for themselves. The photos appear in stark contrast to the discipline, professionalism and respect that have characterized our soldiers' performance during nearly 10 years of sustained operations." In March 2011, Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska, pleaded guilty to killing Afghan civilians in a deal that sentenced him to 24 years in prison and positioned him to be the prosecution's key witness against the other soldiers still facing trial. Among those facing murder charges are Holmes of Boise, Idaho; Spec. Adam Winfield of Cape Coral, Florida; Spec. Michael Wagnon of Las Vegas and Gibbs. Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties and smoking hashish. He is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. Wagnon allegedly kept a skull from a corpse, according to charging documents. All five accused in the killings have pleaded not guilty.
Bloody clashes between pro- and anti-Syrian regime fighters raged on early Sunday in Tripoli, Lebanon, a day after the deadliest outburst of violence there in recent weeks indicated Syria's turmoil continues spilling across borders. Twelve people were killed and about 50 were wounded in fighting on Saturday, the state-run National News Agency reported. The clashes continued early Sunday morning, killing at least one person, NNA said. But government intervention appears to have calmed the situation. Syrian president condemns Houla massacre, rejects accusations After meeting with leaders from the different factions involved in the clashes, Interior Minister Marwan Charbel announced that national security forces would enter the area to enforce a cease-fire Sunday morning. Tripoli residents and the NNA news agency said Sunday that Tripoli was quiet after the morning clashes, suggesting fighters apparently adhered to the cease-fire. At one point on Saturday, a continuous stream of rockets hindered national security forces' attempts to secure the area, the news agency said. One rocket exploded over a well-known castle in the city, while another landed some distance away. Prime Minister Najib Mikati went to Tripoli to assess the security situation, state news reported. The sectarian violence in Tripoli -- which is on the Mediterranean coast, about 50 miles from Homs, Syria -- mirrors the tensions in its neighboring nation. Clashes in both nations pit Sunnis, who make up the majority of the Syrian opposition and population, against Alawites and other Shiites, who are dominant in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. Sunnis are the majority in northern Lebanon, where Tripoli is located and where anti-Assad factions are relatively strong. The Syrian president, meanwhile, has more support in southern Lebanon and among members of the powerful Shiite militant and political group Hezbollah, which is considered a terrorist organization by U.S. authorities. The recent fighting is not the first time tensions have simmered over, including in Tripoli. Last month, violence flared after Lebanese authorities arrested Chadi Mawlawi, an Islamist activist who was helping Syrian refugees by providing food and shelter, his cousin said. Lebanon had accused Mawlawi of being an operative in an al Qaeda-inspired group -- something his relatives deny. The activist was eventually released, but not before his arrest sparked fighting that killed seven people and left dozens wounded. Elsewhere in Lebanon, the kidnapping of a group of Shiite Muslim pilgrims in Syria prompted angry protests last month in Beirut, the capital. Also last month, gun battles in Beirut between rival Sunni political parties -- one supporting Syria's al-Assad and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded. That was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where the powerful Hezbollah militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008. That bloodshed came hours after Lebanese troops killed two Sunni Muslim clerics -- both opposed to the embattled Syrian regime -- at a checkpoint in northern Lebanon. Syria has long been a major influence in Lebanon, and not just because of the extensive border the two nations share. Lebanon was considered part of "greater Syria" until the end of World War I. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop Lebanon's long civil war, though they stayed long after the fighting stopped in 1990. The Syrian forces' 2005 withdrawal followed the car-bomb killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut, which some blamed on elements of al-Assad's regime. Since then, Lebanon's most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided -- the ruling pro-Syria alliance led by Prime Minister Mikati on one side and anti-Syrian factions led by Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated former prime minister, on the other. The unrest in Syria that began 15 months ago with peaceful anti-government protests, followed by a government crackdown, has meant further complications for Lebanon. Thousands of refugees have poured across the border. And in April the Lebanese army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for Tripoli that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in Syria. CNN's Saad Abedine, Hamdi Alkhshali and Nick Thompson contributed to this report.
Scientists are more convinced that human activity is behind the increase in global temperatures since the 1950s, which has boosted sea levels and the odds of extreme storms, according to a leaked draft of an upcoming U.N. report. "It is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010," according to a summary of the draft obtained by CNN. "There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century." Those conclusions come from the upcoming report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the fifth in a series of multiyear reports seen as a benchmark on the subject. The panel's last report, in 2007, concluded that it was 90% certain that rising temperatures were due to human activity; the new draft raises that figure to 95%. Climate change may increase violence, study shows The panel's report is slated for release in sections, starting in September, and could be revised. But Marshall Shepherd, a research meteorologist at the University of Georgia and the president of the American Meteorological Society, said the report is expected "to strongly identify the significant human impact on the climate system." "There are certainly some uncertainties that should be acknowledged, but the consensus is very clear that humans are playing a significant role," said Shepherd, who contributed to the 2007 report but was not involved in compiling the upcoming document. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other emissions have driven up global average temperatures by about 0.6 degrees C (1 degree F) since 1950, the report states. That's likely to go up by between 1 and 3.7 degrees C (1.8 to 6.6 F) by 2100, the draft states. Climate change sticker shock: Arctic thaw could cost $60 trillion Meanwhile, the rise of sea levels, currently about 3 mm (1/8 inch) per year, is "very likely" to speed up. Global average sea levels are expected to go up between 50 and 97 cm -- 20 inches to more than 3 feet -- by 2100, according to the draft. "Emissions at or above current rates would induce changes in all components in the climate system, some of which would very likely be unprecedented in hundreds to thousands of years," it states. Those changes are likely to occur "in all regions of the globe" and affect the water cycle, rising ocean acidity and changes in the water cycle. "Many of these changes would persist for many centuries," it added. Opinion: Obama is right on climate change The effect has already been seen in shrinking summer icepacks in the Arctic Ocean and warming permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere, it states. "It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that Northern Hemisphere snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global temperature rises," the draft states. The science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers, who point to heat-trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause. A May study of research papers published between 1991 and 2011 found that more than 97% of those that expressed an opinion on the cause of increasing temperatures supported that consensus. Skeptics point to the fact that the rate of warming has slowed since 1998, a record warm year. But two more years, 2005 and 2010, have topped that record -- and the report notes that each of the last three decades have been warmer than the last. Meanwhile, the insurance industry and urban planners are treating sea-level rise as a real threat. A study published over the weekend in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change warned that the world's largest coastal cities will face tens of billions in flood losses a year even with improved defenses. The most vulnerable city on the list was the Chinese city of Guangzhou, with Miami, New York, New Orleans and Mumbai rounding out the top five. New York and much of New Jersey are still rebuilding from 2012's catastrophic Superstorm Sandy, and a federal government report released Monday said reconstruction should take into account "the existing and future threats exacerbated by climate change." "More than ever, it is critical that when we build for the future, we do so in a way that makes communities more resilient to emerging challenges such as rising sea levels, extreme heat and more frequent and intense storms," Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan wrote in the report's preface. CNN's Tristan Smith, Dave Hennen and Brandon Miller contributed to this report.
Henry V rallies his troops in William Shakespeare's play of the same name before the Battle of Agincourt with these words: "Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more... When the blast of war blows in our ears then initiate the action of the tiger. Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood." King Henry's call to action is cited as one of the most motivational speeches in history, and the British Army would no doubt have hoped for similarly inspiring words and good PR from his namesake descendant, Prince Harry, in interviews timed to coincide with his departure from Afghanistan. But as the prince recalled the "taste of blood" in his mouth as he waited to attack Taliban insurgents from his helicopter gunship, his comments appear to have stirred up as much mockery and controversy as sympathy. Prince Harry on Afghan mission: 'Take a life to save a life' The third-in-line to the British throne, known in the military as Captain Wales, also compared having his finger on the trigger of rockets, missiles and a 30mm cannon to playing video games. "It's a joy for me. I am one of those people who loves playing Playstation and XBox and so I am good with my thumbs, I like to think that I am quite useful." In Afghanistan, the media-savvy Taliban seized on the remarks and called Harry a "coward" for only speaking when he was out of danger. "This prince comes and compares this war with his games, PlayStation or whatever he calls it," Zabihullah Mujahid told the Daily Telegraph. "To describe the war in Afghanistan as a game demeans anyone -- especially a prince, who is supposed to be made of better things." Even an Afghan parliamentarian admitted Harry's comments could risk damaging relations. Sharifullah Kamawal told the newspaper: "This makes the withdrawal process much faster, because for now half of the people say the foreign forces must stay for longer, but if they say these kind of things then more people will want them to go home." Prince Harry also appeared to acknowledge that he killed insurgents on his four-month tour of duty in Helmand Province. He said it was sometimes justified to "take a life to save a life. That's what we revolve around, I suppose." "Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground and if that means shooting someone who is shooting at them, then we will do it." The comments set social media alight, with comments both in favour and critical of the prince. The British tabloids also splashed the story about him across their front pages: The Sun's headline was: "Harry kills Taliban chief: Hero prince in missile strike on commander" In Britain, the Stop the War Coalition criticized the 28-year-old's comments as "crass" and questioned how he knew those he'd killed were actually members of the Taliban. "In recent months many civilians have been killed by air strikes. This arrogant and insensitive attitude to killing Afghans, whoever they are, is hardly likely to win hearts and minds -- a supposed aim of the war," said the group's convener Lindsey German. In the Guardian, one commentator mocked Harry's language. "This is Captain Wales's new incarnation: Killer Captain!" wrote Hadley Freeman. Referring to the occasion when Harry was photographed naked in a Las Vegas hotel room, Freeman added: "During his deployment in 2007-08, Captain Wales spoke of his frustration at not being able to partake in actual action. No more! Now he drops gung-ho aphorisms like Dick Cheney ("Take a life to save a life") and the young chap who only months before was photographed with his fingers in the most curious of places during a game of "strip billiards" in Las Vegas has since placed those same fingers "on the triggers of deadly rockets, missiles and a 30mm cannon." While many analysts in Britain praised Harry for risking his life to support ground troops in Helmand, one politician questioned the tone of his remarks. Opposition defense spokesman Jim Murphy said: "I'm not going to second guess whether he should or shouldn't have said it. "He's obviously a young and brave man. He was candid. Perhaps he may have been more candid than the Palace may have wished." In the interviews, Harry said he relished the relative freedom -- largely away from the scrutiny of the world's media -- that serving in the military offered him. "It's very easy to completely forget about who I am when I am in the army," he told reporters. But he added that he would prefer to have been serving on the ground than as an airman based at Camp Bastion along with 4,000 other British service personnel. "My choice would have been back out on the ground with my regiment," he said. "For me it's not that normal because I go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp, and that's one thing that I dislike about being here. Which is probably another reason why I'd love to be out in the PBs [patrol bases], away from it all." In his interviews the prince makes little attempt at all to hide his antipathy towards the media and the tabloids in particular. "Everyone's guilty for buying the papers...though hopefully no one believes what they read." But after reading the criticism of his own comments, he may want to reflect on another famous line from Shakespeare's "Henry V": "Men of few words are the best men."
As fellow family members challenge claims that the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States lied about his exposure to the virus, the man's mother rallied around him Friday in describing him as a good person who she just wants to hug again. "Everyone (in the family) loves him because (if) anything happens to us, he's always there for us," Nowah Gartay, Thomas Eric Duncan's mother, told CNN. Duncan arrived in Texas from Liberia on Saturday, September 20. He started feeling sick a few days later, before being admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital -- where he'd gone and been sent home previously -- on Sunday, September 28. Two days later, a blood test confirmed he had Ebola. Duncan is currently in isolation in serious condition at the same Dallas hospital. How the Liberian national left Africa, and whether he should have been allowed to, has become a hot topic in recent days. Hazmat crews clean up, quarantined quartet moved out Before flying out, Duncan allegedly answered "no" to questions on a health screening questionnaire about whether he'd cared for anyone with Ebola, touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease. But Tugbeh Chief Tugbeh, a community leader in Liberia, has said that Duncan was "a caretaker" for a woman who died from Ebola at a residence outside the capital of Monrovia. Because of these and other claims, Liberia Airport Authority officials say they may prosecute Duncan if he lied before leaving that West African nation. The Dallas County District Attorney's office said Friday that it is "looking into whether or not Thomas Eric Duncan knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter." Discussing this case, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told Canadian public broadcaster CBC, "The fact that he knew (he was exposed to the virus) and he left the country is unpardonable, quite frankly." "With the U.S. doing so much to help us fight Ebola, and again one of our compatriots didn't take due care, and so, he's gone there and ... put some Americans in a state of fear, and put them at some risk, and so I feel very saddened by that and very angry with him, to tell you the truth." Duncan's nephew on Friday strongly rejected such allegations, much like other relatives have in recent days. Sitting alongside Gartay in Charlotte, North Carolina, Josephus Weeks told CNN's Jim Sciutto that Duncan told him "he had moved a long time ago" from an area hit hard by Ebola. "He said, 'Well, I wasn't even in that area,'" said Weeks in direct response to Tugbeh's claim. "... He wasn't a part of that whole scenario that has been populating the news all these many days. So that's inaccurate." Weeks proceeded to take a shot at some Liberian citizens and "so many ignorant government officials," saying it's not fair that such claims can be made public without being vetted first. "Any time they see a camera, they just jump right in front of it and make a statement," Weeks said. "Unfortunately, most of them are ignorant, and they are all lies." As to what's happened in the United States, Weeks criticized Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital for not connecting the dots and passing on relevant information that Duncan had come from Liberia. This should have tipped off the possibility he had Ebola, given his symptoms; instead he was let go from the hospital after about four hours, according to his partner, who identified herself to CNN only as Louise. U.S. health officials have said that the failure to pass on this information was a mistake. "It was upsetting to find that he was possibly infected with that deadly disease, and the hospital was not showing me any signs that they were equipped to handle that particular situation," said Weeks, who added that he called the U.S. Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention but did not specify when. Who's in charge of stopping Ebola in the U.S.? Youngor Jallah -- Louise's daughter who called Duncan her "stepdaddy," though her mother and he aren't believed to be legally married -- was the one who called Sunday for the ambulance for Duncan while visiting the apartment where he was staying. But she told CNN on Friday night that she learned that Duncan had Ebola "on the news." Jallah said she's especially frustrated that, while she may not be technically quarantined, health officials told her Tuesday, "we can't go outside, we can't do nothing." "We asked them, 'Can we go outside to get our babies' diapers'?" she said. "They told us, 'No. You guys should stay in here until we can ask our boss if you guys can go out." Three days later, Jallah -- who claims Duncan never threw up or even went to the bathroom when she saw him -- hasn't heard back. "No one gave me any direction," she said. "... I'm scared." All these frustrations notwithstanding, Duncan's mother also made a point Friday to emphatically thank the doctors, nurses and attendants now caring for her son. While some might have made mistakes, others are working hard to try to get him better. "I thank every one of you, (I) thank you for my son," she said. "I love him. All (his) family members love him."
the curious annual song contest that sees a continent united around its televisions for an evening of high-energy songs, spangled costumes and ill-advised drinking games -- is once more upon us. Founded in 1956, it was intended as a way to bring together once-warring nations through the innocent medium of pop music. It hasn't necessarily ended the rivalries (the voting-based results system is notoriously territorial), but for the hundreds of millions watching on TV, Eurovision is a well-rehearsed, almost comforting routine. It's less comforting, however, for the competitors and fans dispatched to an unfamiliar city -- this year's Grand Final will be held May 10 at the B&W Grand Ballroom in Copenhagen -- to uphold or betray national honor with only leotard-clad backing dancers for company. Copenhagen: 10 Things to know before you go Help is at hand, though. Herewith our insiders' guide to maximizing post-Eurovision joy, or minimizing sorrow, in the Danish capital. Drinking and dancing Copenhagen is compact for a major capital, with a shade over half a million inhabitants, but it's increasingly famed for nightlife, especially in the Meatpacking District -- just like the similarly scenester-filled area of New York -- near the central station. Here the nightlife concentration is sufficiently dense to allow disgruntled central European crooners to stumble from bar to club. For those determined to dance, locals suggest KB18 (Kodboderne 18; +45 33 313 933), or Culture Box (Kronprinsessegade 54; +45 33 325 050). Slightly closer to the contest's harbor-side venue is the dingy but welcoming Eiffel Bar (Wildersgade 18; + 45 32 577 092) in Christianshavn, a possible home-from-home for this year's face fur-fixated French entry, Twin Twin. The walls are covered in Parisian iconography and the beer is dirt cheap. The more adventurous could venture to one of the city's most defiantly hip nightclubs, Sunday (Lille Kongensgade 16; +45 53 668 228), which boasts an in-house team of Thai transgender dancers and a mission to -- their words -- "push the borders of wicked indecency." Eating Enough about Noma, already. The seashore-foraging, micro-herb-arranging repeat winner of the best restaurant in the world crown is undeniably astounding. But the chances of getting a table are roughly the same as Portugal's prospects of ever winning Eurovision (this year's entrant, Suzy, was kicked out in the semi-finals, adding to half a century of failure). Perhaps off limits too are various offshoots such as Amass, run by a former Noma head chef, or Bror, where the specialty is braised lamb's head with whipped brain and stuffed eyeballs -- which sounds almost as tricky to digest as Latvia's saccharine Eurovision entry. Danish restaurant Noma named the world's best A better bet is smorrebrod, the traditional Danish open sandwiches that are escaping their lunchtime roots and entering the world of fine dining. Smorrebrod and 10 more new American sandwich heroes Many of the better known outlets tend to be booked up, but you can try Dyrehaven (Sonder Boulevard 72)off Vesterbro in the city center, which doesn't take reservations and attracts a fashionable crowd. For more basic fare still, there's always Copenhagen's many and famous hot dog stands. Harry's Place (Nordre Fasanvej 269) is a little ways outside the center, but locals make the trip for both the sausages and the trademark chili sauce, known as krudt -- the Danish word for gunpowder. Same-sex marriage Not for everyone, obviously, and arguably a little hard to arrange on a night out. Nevertheless, this is one of the Eurovision-based attractions promoted by Copenhagen officials. Throughout the Eurovision weekend the city is encouraging any couples to tie the knot. Ceremonies can be held on a specially arranged "wedding boat" cruising the harbor. The marriages are intended to mark both the 25th anniversary of same-sex civil partnerships in Denmark -- the first country in the world to permit them -- and Eurovision's open-minded reputation. With its focus on flamboyant acts and tight sequined outfits, the contest has always had a decidedly camp air, a reputation sealed when Dana International, an Israeli transgender woman, won in 1998. Her mantle has been passed this year to Austria's entrant, Conchita Wurst, the bearded drag alter ego of singer Tom Neuwirth. Cycling Something of a Danish cliche, perhaps -- the city has one of the highest rates of bike use in the world -- but stick with us, because Eurovision 2014 needs all the environmental help it can get. Most bike-friendly cities in the United States This year's event had proudly branded itself the greenest contest ever -- until newspapers discovered electricity for the venue itself is being provided by 26 very large, very smelly diesel generators. Contestants can pedal serenely away from the fumes, and the humiliation of being beaten by Malta's Mumford and Sons-lite entry, Firelight, on Copenhagen's famous network of segregated bike lanes. Organizers are laying on fleets of bikes for Eurovision use, and the city is littered with rental shops. (Rent A Bike Copenhagen, Adelgade 11; +45 32 12 50 50 and Gasværksvej 5;+45 50 32 11 00). For those feeling particularly homesick -- or humiliated -- the city's airport, only about six miles from the center, is connected by yet more of those ubiquitous bike lanes. The Little Mermaid While arguably the most iconic symbol of Copenhagen, the bronze statue of Hans Christian Andersen's famous fairy tale character is underwhelming in real life, standing little more than a meter tall. Five places to find mermaids Her harbor-side location, however, is restful -- the perfect place to sit and contemplate what might have been had the seams on the lead dancer's costume held together a little longer. It's a place to consider also that even if Copenhagen's attractions aren't enough, things could have been much, much more sedate. The capital won its bid to host the event against a series of notably smaller Danish locations. Among them was Herning, a city on Denmark's Jutland peninsula whose tourist information board lists "libraries" as among the chief attractions.
It's been five years since the banking and credit crisis rocked the U.S. economy, causing markets to plunge, unemployment to spike, housing values to crumble and placing more Americans in financial peril than at any time since the Great Depression. On Monday, President Barack Obama touted his administration's successes in helping to turn things around even though national economic growth remains sluggish and millions of people have given up looking for work. Obama said government's response "put a floor under the fall" and his policies set the stage for an end to economic contraction and created an environment for the economy to grow again. The president specifically pointed to the impact of the economic stimulus, creation of seven million jobs, the resurgence of the bailed out Detroit automakers, higher taxes on the wealthiest earners and an increase in exports. "We've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we've begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity," Obama said. Although Obama paints a rosy scenario, there are still key questions on the economy. Larry Summers, a leading name to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, withdrew his name from consideration on Sunday, clearing the way for Janet Yellen, who serves as vice chairwoman at the Fed, to become the leading candidate. Also, the White House announced last week that top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, will step down as head of the National Economic Council and be replaced by Jeffrey Zients, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. There is also the looming showdown with Congress on funding the government, raising the ability of the nation to borrow money to pay its bills, and continuation of the drastic budget cuts that took effect earlier this year absent a deal in Washington to reduce the deficit. There is also the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care law backed by Obama that is taking effect this year and remains a political flashpoint with Republicans. It's the economy, stupid That motto was made famous by political strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, and rang true for Obama's first presidential campaign as well. And the American public agrees. In poll after poll, fixing the economy is a stubborn No. 1 when it comes to the issues the voters most care about. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month indicates that 41% of the public says the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now, with health care at 16% and the crisis in Syria at 15%. Soon after taking office, Obama signed a massive economic stimulus bill, led the charge for Wall Street reform and accelerated the bailout of the U.S. auto industry, which threatened to collapse and take more than 1 million jobs with it. Some began to compare Obama to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who transformed the fabric of American society in the face of the Depression with aggressive government intervention. 'Poor marks' But since his first two years in office, some experts say, the president has struggled to keep focused on the economy. Liberal economist Dean Baker has been highly critical of his record. "I give him very poor marks. Five years later, the economy is still very far from recovering," said Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, pointing to an unemployment rate that he says would hover around 9% instead of 7.3% if so many people hadn't given up and dropped out of the work force. And it shows in Obama's approval ratings. Through much of last year, he had a 30% approval rating on the economy. That number is up this year -- to 43% -- but most still disapprove of his handling of the issue. A screeching halt In 2010, many conservatives, led by the tea party movement, sought to stop the president's agenda. They voted out the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and replaced them with conservative Republicans. Then, those Republicans did what they were sent to Washington to do. The president has struggled to pass any major economic legislation since 2010. Instead, he's been jumping from one political crisis to the next. Fights over federal budget and spending levels locked Congress in multiple battles in 2011 and 2012 that nearly led to the shutdown of the government. The narrative didn't always fall in Obama's favor; nor did the policies that ensued. Republicans shifted the conversation from economic stimulus to deficit reduction. The president jumped on the deficit-reduction bandwagon and made that a priority. Through protracted political battles over the size of the government, forced spending cuts, which sliced up to 10% of most of the federal budget, went into effect. It wasn't the president's favorite idea, however, for how to revive the economy. He still had hopes of repairing old bridges and building new windmills. So did his supporters, who grew frustrated with the president. "We're getting tired. ... The unemployment is unconscionable. We don't know what the (president's) strategy is," Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, said in 2012. But in the frame of deficit reduction, Obama was able to obtain a few concessions. He won a series of tax increases, including an increase on the top tax earners: those making more than $400,000 per year. And the needle moved. The budget cuts, tax increases and a recovering economy will reduce the deficit by about $4 trillion over 10 years, according to the White House. The nation's debt ratio to size of the gross domestic product is expected to stabilize in the next decade, which economists hail as good for the economy. The foreign affairs president While the president came into office with little experience in foreign affairs and hopes to implement an expansive domestic agenda, overseas conflict has kept his plate full. He expanded the war in Afghanistan and ended the war in Iraq. He kept his attention on the citizen-led revolts that swept the Arab world and expanded the use of drones. Under his administration, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed and the U.S. joined a NATO campaign to overthrow Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and Obama is now working on an intense campaign to respond to the use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war. Although presidents are forced to walk and chew gum at the same time, world events have created challenges for Obama's ability to implement his domestic agenda. "When you look at issues like military strikes in Syria ... it takes the full time and attention of the leaders," Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said recently. As the president decided to hold off on a military strike in Syria while Secretary of State John Kerry works with his counterpart in Russia to devise a plan to rid the regime of its chemical weapons, the president attempted to revitalize discussion of his domestic agenda. "Even as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue ... it is still important to recognize that we've got a lot more stuff to do here in this government," Obama said during a meeting with his Cabinet on Thursday. Economist Mark Zandi said that, all things considered, the president has been fairly successful on the domestic front. "It has been a tough road, but I think he did a pretty good job," said Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. But economist Baker offered a more critical perspective, saying the president hasn't shown a willingness to push an economic agenda. "Let's say Syria didn't happen. What would he be doing right now? I am not sure he has some agenda that is being obstructed by events in the world," he said. Syria aside, much of the White House's attention this fall will be spent on getting Americans to sign up for the health insurance exchanges, the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Open enrollment begins October 1, and the administration is expected to spend $8.7 million on a media blitz to promote the exchanges. Super Bowl champs to promote Obamacare Second term, second chance After his re-election, the president hoped to reset his economic agenda. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama said he will work to "reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class." This summer, he launched a campaign to revive his focus on the economy. In a series of speeches this year, he acknowledged the troubling economic indicators that are keeping the economy from a full recovery, including income inequality and employment disparities. Americans' real median household income fell from $63,000 to $55,600 between 2000 and 2011, and as of December, 9.1 million jobs were necessary to restore the job market to pre-recession levels, according to the Economic Policy Institute. "Reversing these trends has to be Washington's highest priority. It has to be Washington's highest priority. It's certainly my highest priority," Obama said in Galesburg, Illinois, in July. Job creation, affordable education and home ownership were central to his proposals. Those initiatives included expanding development of renewable energy, creating new power grids and expanding access to early childhood education. But what has the president done since that July speech? Some say, not much. "Nothing has happened on any front," economist Zandi said. White House press secretary Jay Carney pushed back, arguing that the president is still focused on those economic priorities. "The president remains committed to pushing forward on an economic agenda that creates a better bargain for the middle class," Carney said Wednesday. As new threats of a government shutdown over government funding and the debt ceiling loom, the president confronted the issue Monday. "I can''t remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it doesn't get 100% of what it wants," the president said, blaming the Republicans for potential "massive economic turmoil." With ongoing political stalemates and a protracted fight over the budget and debt ceiling, Zandi said immigration reform, which would be a major catalyst for economic growth, appears to be heading nowhere in the House. And tax and entitlement reform, which would also help to stimulate the economy, have no chance of happening this year. There's always next year. But 2014 is an election year, which creates an even more difficult environment for passing legislation. After that, the president is in his final two years of office, and the political machine begins shaping the next occupant of the Oval Office. Then, by definition, it can be hard for a lame duck president to get much done. CNN's Dan Merica, Paul Steinhauser and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.
Americans in two dozen states from the Midwest to the Southeast and Northeast are shivering this week courtesy of a distorted polar vortex. The rush of cold air it's sending southward is the biggest visitor from the North Pole since Santa Claus. The gifts it brings, however, are chilling and generally unwelcome. Much of the United States has plunged into a deep freeze from record low temperatures. CNN International senior meteorologist Brandon Miller answers a few pressing questions about this phenomenon. What is a polar vortex? What distinguishes it? The polar vortex, as it sounds, is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the northern pole in a counterclockwise direction -- a polar low-pressure system.  These winds tend to keep the bitter cold air locked in the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is not a single storm. On occasion, this vortex can become distorted and dip much farther south than you would normally find it, allowing cold air to spill southward. How frequently does this polar vortex distortion occur? The upper-level winds that make up the polar vortex change in intensity from time to time. When those winds decrease significantly, it can allow the vortex to become distorted, and the result is a jet stream that plunges deep into southern latitudes, bringing the cold, dense Arctic air spilling down with it. This oscillation is known as the Arctic Oscillation and it can switch from a positive phase to negative phase a few times per year. This oscillation -- namely the negative phase where the polar winds are weaker -- tends to lead to major cold air outbreaks in one or more regions of the planet. Where on Earth can this happen? The polar vortex can lead to major cold air outbreaks in any portion of the Northern Hemisphere -- North America, Europe and Asia. This will lead to cold snaps in multiple locations, though not always. How dangerous is a polar vortex distortion as compared to a tornado or hurricane? Completely different type of systems. A cold air outbreak caused by the polar vortex is much more widespread and lasts longer than a single storm. With the widespread drop in temperature, however, you can see significant winter storms develop, especially when the cold air is initially advancing into a previously warm region -- much like the nor'easter this past week. When was the last big one to hit a densely populated area? Serious cold snaps happen several times a year, though in different regions of the world and with different severities. Last March saw a significant decrease in temperature as a result of the polar vortex pushing into much of Europe. Many locations experienced an Easter holiday that was much colder than their Christmas holiday. The United Kingdom, for instance, had its coldest March in 50 years. If you get caught up in one, what should you do? Again, it's not a "storm" that you get caught in. But when faced with significant cold temperatures, you should stay inside whenever possible, layer clothing if you must be outside, winterize your home and car, etc. Is it a side effect of global warming and should we expect more events like this? This is a hotly researched topic. In short, yes, it could be. It seems counterintuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one, but some research shows that it could. We know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet, melting of the Arctic Sea ice, etc. This includes extreme distortions of the jet stream, which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter. Parts of Western Europe have been battered by the worst storms for two decades during the past week -- are they related to the weather system in the United States? They are related in a sense, but I wouldn't say "caused by." The storms in Europe are the result of a persistent pattern that has seen the jet stream parked near the United Kingdom and Ireland, which has brought a train of storm systems over the British Isles. This is the same jet stream, of course, that has plunged deep into the southern portions of the United States.  So, the jet stream has been "stuck" in a position that is allowing cold Arctic air to spill into much of the United States and Canada. But it is in a position that is bringing warmer, moist air from the Atlantic over Northwest Europe, resulting in the stormy conditions.
The critics are raving about Steven Spielberg's new film "Lincoln." A.O. Scott of the New York Times called it "among the finest films ever made about American politics." Viewers get a taste of the legislative process up close by watching how President Abraham Lincoln rounded up the necessary votes in get the 13th Amendment resolution through the House. Viewers see a master at work -- a president who knew how to break through the various divisions in Congress and outflank his opponents. Review: 'Lincoln' brilliantly dramatizes delicacy of politics Movies such as Spielberg's often result in inflated expectations about what a president could achieve in the current political environment. The reality is that even the best presidents would have trouble rounding up votes in the contemporary Congress. As the nation continues to be obsessed with a sex scandal involving top military officials and as the lame-duck Congress figures out what to do about the fiscal cliff, Washington would do well to think seriously about how government reform might improve the basic machinery of the federal government so that elected officials are better able to handle the big issues of the day such as unemployment, immigration, climate change and more. Reform must start with reining in the power of money and organized interest groups. Campaign finance reform, once a promise of President Barack Obama in 2008, has taken a back seat even though the president made some progress on reforming lobbying early in his term. Unless Congress does more to prevent the revolving door between Capitol Hill and K Street and limit the power of private money in campaigns, it will be difficult to change the status quo. With more than $6 billion spent on the recent election, elected officials will have to maneuver around donors who were essential to both sides of the campaign and who will be expecting access when the new year begins. Then there is the filibuster, which currently requires a supermajority on most pieces of legislation given that the congressional minority has been willing to use this mechanism with ruthless abandon. Since 2007, according to the Senate Historical Office, there were more than 360 Republican filibusters. When Congress reconvenes in early 2013, it will have one shot to change the rules so that the threshold for passing a filibuster is lowered. In January 2009, lawmakers let the opportunity slip away. The chronic use of the filibuster threat has been one of the central culprits behind dysfunction as the congressional minority has immense power to block progress. But it's not just Congress that has to step up its act. The White House, for example, needs to curtail one of the legacies of Lincoln that has often caused friction with Congress and circumvented the kind of the checks and balances we depend on: executive power. Throughout the 20th century, and especially in recent decades, presidents routinely employ executive power, such as signing statements, to circumvent the will of Congress. Obama, who started his term critical of how President George W. Bush had employed this authority, has started to replicate his predecessor. The president used executive power to conduct national security operations as well as to strengthen environmental regulations. "I refuse to take 'no' for an answer," Obama said, "When Congress refuses to act and -- as a result -- hurts our economy and puts people at risk, I have an obligation as president to do what I can without them." The problem with executive power is that it results in policies that can easily be overturned and which rarely have bipartisan support. It also sets a precedent for the president to erode legislative power. Recently, in a wonderful play at my children's school, the students put on a show about how a bill becomes a law. The play begins with protest that unfolds when a group of parents want to impose a candy tax on their children after they collect their Halloween treats. The president, moved by the protesters, sends this proposal to Congress. After a committee drafts the legislation, the House of Representatives passes the measure, as does the Senate. But soon after, the Supreme Court declares the bill to be unconstitutional. As my wife and I watched two of our children star in the play, we could not help but think about what the teachers decided to leave out of the script. What parts of our political process are sanitized when we translate them into a production for children? There was no talk of lobbyists, filibusters and executive power. As the new Congress gets ready to reconvene in January, this is the time to consider reform. If we want to reach the high moments captured in Spielberg's film about Lincoln, we need to make sure our political process, albeit difficult, works. Otherwise dysfunction will rule. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.
The Serbian capital of Belgrade and the lavish Claridge's Hotel in the heart of London might be more than 1,000 miles apart, but for one day some seven decades ago the two places came much closer. On 17 July 1945, Queen Alexandria of Yugoslavia gave birth to her son, Crown Prince Alexander, in the hotel's 212 suite. Then British Prime Minister Winston Churchill designated the room Yugoslavian territory for the day so that the baby prince could retain his right to the throne. "It was an extraordinary act that he did," recalls Crown Prince Alexander. In 1941, Germany invaded and occupied Yugoslavia forcing the country's King -- Peter II -- to move into exile in London. Later on, he was banned from returning home by the Communist government that followed World War II Alexander, who was baptized by Queen Elizabeth and her father King George, grew up abroad and only visited his country for the first time in 1991. Ten years later, he returned to live in Belgrade after the country's government decided to give him and his family the right to use the city's royal palaces, which were taken from the royals when they were stripped of their possessions and citizenship by the communists. "I never thought we'd come back here -- I really didn't," he says. The power of religion After decades abroad, the return home signaled many first experiences for the Crown Prince -- and one of those included celebrating the Patron Saint Day of the Royal Family, St. Andrew the First, in Serbia. "It's even more meaningful doing it at home, very much so," says Alexander, who has today a strictly ceremonial role. The Serbian Orthodox religion is closely bound to the country's identity -- around 85% of the 7.2 million population declare themselves as Orthodox. Since his return in 2001, Crown Prince Alexander has enjoyed the feast of St. Andrew as an open, inter faith celebration -- a turning point for Serbian history. "It's wonderful and very moving for me to see that he has accomplished that because they're all together sitting and talking to each other," says the Crown Prince's wife, Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Katherine. "It's hard to believe this country was in conflict so many years ago and for such a long time." Luckily, it seems that those days are over. Watch the video below to find out more about Serbia's royals and the role of religion in the country's history.

a meeting concluded when Issa cut the hearing room microphones with his harshest critic on the panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings, in mid sentence. "From what I understand, I think Mr. Issa was in his rights to adjourn the hearing," Boehner told reporters on Thursday. The Congressional Black Caucus wants Issa removed as House Oversight Committee chairman following Wednesday's uproar, which it sees as the latest in a series of disrespectful responses to pushback from Democrats during hearings on the IRS matter. The group offered a resolution on Thursday. "Chairman Issa's abusive behavior on March 5th is part of a continuing pattern in which he has routinely excluded members of the committee from investigative meetings and has routinely provided information to the  press before  sharing it with committee members," Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Marcia Fudge said. The organization also sent Boehner a letter. "The abuse of authority and misuse of the congressional privileges afforded them are an affront to the expectations of the American public. Congressman Darrell Issa of California abused his authority and therefore must be reprimanded to ensure the dignity of the House of Representatives is preserved," Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, wrote. "We urge you to take prompt action to maintain the integrity of this body and remove Mr. Issa as chair of the Oversight & Government Reform Committee immediately," the letter continued. Tensions are strained between Democrats and Republicans as the two sides continue to probe whether the IRS intentionally targeted conservative groups seeking tax exempt status. The issue flared anew this week following a series of hearings last year around the oversight panel's investigation. Issa: GOP-led IRS targeting probe may be at 'dead end' Republicans see former IRS official Lois Lerner's decision to invoke her constitutional rights not to testify at hearings as obstructionist. Democrats believe their GOP colleagues are trying to squeeze any kind of political capital they can out of an embarrassing episode for the Obama administration in a midterm election year. Those frustrations boiled over on Wednesday when Issa refused to take Cummings' statement and muted his microphone when he protested an early end to the hearing during which Lerner again refused to testify. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, says he knows a thing or two about respect. "Let me tell you something. I've been practicing law for 30, 40 years. And, so you see these kind of things," Cummings said after the hearing Wednesday. "But the thing that we are determined is not to be detracted, to get to the truth. And so I see it as a distraction. I don't worry about disrespect, okay?" On Thursday, Cummings elaborated on why he felt Issa's actions were troubling. "This is not the first time chairman Issa has shut mics down. You can't shut out the minority voice," Cummings said. "He shut me down because he didn't want to hear what I was saying or what he thought what I was saying. That's un-American." Cummings told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" that he talked briefly with Issa on Thursday and said he doesn't "expect him to apologize." Other Democratic lawmakers were similarly upset. "What happened was so outrageous, so demeaning, so unjudicial, so awful in every respect, that we just absolutely have actually reached the boiling point," said Rep. Louis Slaughter or New York and the top Democrat on the Rules Committee. Issa defended his actions. "He was talking into a mic in an adjourned meeting. The fact is Mr. Cummings came to make a point of his objections to the process we'd been going through. He was, he was actually slandering me at the moment that the mics did go off by claiming that this had not been a real investigation," Issa said Wednesday. "This had been a bipartisan investigation by multiple committees in which we had testimony in multiple hearings ... in which it was very clear there was targeting of conservative groups in which there were people who were acting outside the norm. We're going to continue our investigation.  But just because Mr. Cummings would like to have a more convenient truth doesn't give him the right to make a speech." Issa has also indicated that the probe may be approaching a "dead end" after nearly a year. "It may well be that we have gotten to the bottom of it," Issa said. Such uncertainty raises questions about whether Republicans who have alleged the targeting order came from political higher-ups, even the White House, can win a legal battle to compel Lerner to provide testimony.
There wasn't a cloud in the sky early Friday when Dave Samuels trained his telescopes at the moon, hoping to catch a glimpse of a NASA rocket striking the lunar landscape. The moon, shown shortly before NASA's rockets hit on Friday morning. "We saw nothing," he said. Samuels is vice president of the Fremont Peak Observatory near Monterey, California, which had invited members of the public to watch Friday's NASA mission through its telescopes. The lunar strike happened shortly after 4:30 a.m. on the West Coast (7:30 a.m. ET). NASA had encouraged everyone around the country to host "impact parties," saying the plume of dust generated by the lunar impact would be visible through "mid-sized backyard" telescopes 10 inches or larger. It said the chances of seeing the plume were greater for people living in areas that were still dark. The space agency even posted an interactive map on its Web site so people could find "a public event near you." NASA officials had said the impact of the Centaur upper-stage rocket would result in plumes of dust of more than 250 metric tons. After it hit, the debris was analyzed by a satellite -- launched along with the rocket -- that traveled through the dust cloud before its own impact on the moon. The goal of the $79 million mission was to determine whether  there is water on the moon. After the impact, NASA officials called the mission a success, saying the satellite sent back a good amount of data that now will be analyzed. Jennifer Stracener of Vilonia, Arkansas, said she got up early to watch NASA's live telecast of the impact. She was disappointed, and posted her reaction on CNN's iReport.com. "These was no plume, no nothing," she said by phone. "It just kind of blacked out." She said the telecast did not show the rocket's impact clearly. "I was looking for some action -- something happening," she said. "I think a lot of people were, because they [NASA] hyped it up, you know. ... No one saw anything." Stracener woke up her husband and two children to see the lunar crash. She said she wishes she hadn't. Darrick Gray, a high school science teacher near Kansas City, Missouri, had planned to take some of his students to the nearby Powell Observatory to watch the lunar impact through their telescopes -- but they decided to skip the field trip because of bad weather. "This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime thing," Gray had said beforehand. Gray -- who is also the director of the Astronomical Society of Kansas City -- said he had hoped the mission would influence his students to think about pursuing careers in science. "Being as we do live here in Missouri, we're away from the hub [of astronomy]," he explained. "We're not in Florida, we're not in Texas, we're not in Silicon Valley -- it's not something they're used to seeing. "So any time you can show them something that's never been done, and they say, 'Oh this is pretty cool,' I think they buy into that." NASA held an all-night party at Ames Research Center -- located just outside San Francisco -- which was directing the mission. There were movies, music, food and guest speakers, and it culminated with a live transmission of the lunar impact. "I would have loved to see, you know, huge amounts of dust flying up and ejecta, but we didn't," said Liza Coe, who attended the Ames event. "I thought it was so neat being able to see just as we got closer and closer to the moon and realizing that that was really happening right now. "It wasn't just a picture of the moon that somebody was putting up." Back at Fremont Peak Observatory, even though most of the 50 people who attended the "impact party" were disappointed, they were good sports about the "failure," Samuels said. Even Samuels, who has been an astronomer since he was 15 years old, said he got a lot out of the viewing party -- which he said was standing-room only. "I don't look at the moon so much because it's always there ... so I got to know the moon's craters better," he said. "And I think the people that attended, some of them that were disappointed, [still] felt like it was worth coming and being part of something that was going on." He said he hopes the event generates more support for the observatory, which is run by volunteers. It is located in Fremont Peak State Park, which is on a list of state parks that could close because of California's recent budget cuts. "We're trying to promote interest in the peak and every single person that came was part of that," he said. "They all learned something." Fremont Peak Observatory has a 30-inch telescope that Samuels described as "the most accessible public telescope in the [San Francisco] Bay area." He said he hoped that the reason they didn't see a plume from the rocket impact wasn't because of "another case where somebody forgot to carry the one" -- a reference to incorrect mathematical computation, which was blamed for the failure of the Mars Surveyor Climate Orbiter mission to Mars in 1999. He suggested that next time, NASA might want to be "a little more careful suggesting people should get out of bed at 4:30 in the morning and haul their kids out there." CNN's John D. Sutter contributed to this report.
It took Norma Margeson a few minutes to learn to control the skinny metal robot. But instead of viewing it as a machine, she soon warmed up to it as a companion. Georgia artist Norma Margeson has embraced a robot prototype that can fetch household items for patients. "Oh, I love it," she said. "I think it is such a unique character. It has a personality all its own. It can be a friend, a very good friend." Margeson, an artist from Marietta, Georgia, is learning how a health care robot dubbed El-E (pronounced "Ellie") can help her accomplish some simple household tasks. El-E is being tested by Margeson and other patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. "We named it El-E because she reminds us of an elephant. She has this one arm that is sort of gray that can lift objects and move up and down," said Professor Charles Kemp, director of the Center for Healthcare Robotics at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Right now Kemp and his colleagues are focusing on programming El-E to locate and fetch common household items such as a hairbrush, a bottle of pills, a cell phone or a TV remote. El-E also can open doors.  Watch El-E the robot in action » A robot with those skills could provide some independence for patients with motor impairments and a respite for caregivers. Kemp said he hopes his robots could help people in wheelchairs, the elderly and those with such diseases as arthritis and diabetes. "There is still significant research to be done in order to make robots like El-E function in real homes on a daily basis," Kemp said. "Real homes contain a diverse array of objects, have obstacles that make robot navigation difficult, have varied lighting, contain fragile items, provide shelter to pets and family members, and have messy areas." Kemp has been working for more than a year with Jonathan Glass, a neurology professor at Emory University in Atlanta and director of the Emory ALS Center. "What Charlie and his team have been very focused on is not what they can make the robots do, but what they can make the robots do that's important to people," Glass said. "We may think of things that are relatively trivial -- picking up a cell phone, picking up a remote control for a TV set or even pushing a button somewhere that they cannot quite reach. That may seem to be a small thing to somebody. But to these folks, it's a very big thing." El-E is about 5 feet tall, with a single robotic arm that can move up and down to pick up objects at different heights. The robot swivels and rolls on a motorized, wheeled base. During a demonstration in a living-room setting at Georgia Tech, Margeson used a laser pointer to identify objects she wanted El-E to deliver to her. Patients with different levels of mobility also can use head-mounted pointers or touch pads. El-E retrieved bottles of pills and a water bottle when Margeson pointed to them, but its claw could not get a proper grip on a cell phone. Like any young creature, however, the robot is designed to learn from its mistakes. "In this case, it missed the object. It should try again actually, and it should recognize that it didn't succeed," Kemp said. Formal studies have shown El-E to be an efficient worker. In 127 out of 134 trials (94.8 percent), the robot successfully picked up the requested object. Kemp and his students have studied the work of service dogs to try to mimic the most useful assistive functions. And while El-E will never be the warm and loving companion that a German shepherd or a Labrador might be, there are efforts to make El-E interactive and at least somewhat anthropomorphic. When El-E is ready to work, it says: "Waiting for laser command." After the patient points at an object, the robot acknowledges, with the words, "Detected laser pointer." Patients can decide whether El-E should put the object on a table or put it directly in their hands. "If you look at me, I will deliver to your hand," says the robotic voice. Glass said that many ALS patients have, by necessity, learned to be tech savvy. "For the most part, patients at this stage of the disease are used to dealing with technology," he said. "They're used to dealing with motorized wheelchairs; they are used to dealing with automatic speaking devices and computers." But programming a robot to do "human" things involves a lot of hardware and software. El-E is powered by a Mac Mini with the Ubuntu Linux operating system. "It needs to have a laser to navigate and to find objects on the surface," Kemp said. "It needs to have this camera so it can know where to move its hand. It needs to have these four sensors so that it can know as it is moving how much to grip on the object, when to stop moving down, when to let go of the object when handing out the object to a person." Kemp's Web site, http://www.charliekemp.com/, includes video that shows what El-E sees as it navigates across a room. Depending on funding, Kemp said he hopes home health care robots may be available in less than 10 years. By that time, El-E may have learned how to carry a plate of hot food from the microwave to the table and pick up a glass without breaking or spilling it.
It's a royal first. Britain's Zara Phillips, Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter, will become the first member of the royal family to appear in a video game. An electronic version of the 32-year-old royal will be featured in an online game for horse lovers, 'Howrse,' in which the Olympic equestrian will mentor and guide players in the UK. Some of her own horses, including her Olympic mount High Kingdom, will be included in the game for players to "own" themselves, game maker Ubisoft said in a statement. The horse breeding game, which has 50 million players worldwide, allows players to raise horses and ponies, take care of them, train them and enhance their skills and abilities. Players can also set up their own stables. Philips, who won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics, will guide players through the opening phases of the game and help them complete tutorials through interactive prompts and feedback. "It's great to be involved with a game that lets children and adults alike interact with horses, horse breeding and stable management on a daily basis, meeting like-minded enthusiasts through the game's social features and sharing experiences," Phillips said in a statement. "Not everyone has access to ride or care for horses regularly and Howrse provides a great opportunity to really understand more about how horses are raised and bred in an easy-to-access and fun way." Phillips and her England rugby player husband, Mike Tindall, are expecting their first child this month.
Iran has stepped up its production of high-grade enriched uranium and has re-landscaped one of its military bases in an apparent effort to hamper a United Nations inquiry into the country's nuclear program, a U.N. report said Thursday. Iran's facilities have produced 189.4 kilograms (417.6 pounds) of the enriched uranium, an increase of 43.8 kilograms (96.6 pounds) since the last U.N. analysis in May, the report said. That enriched uranium is produced at declared facilities in Iran that don't include the military base cited in Thursday's report. Iran hasn't allowed the agency access to the military site, called Parchin, and, in fact, has been conducting "extensive activities" at that location "that will significantly hamper the Agency's ability to conduct effective verification," the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency said in its report. Iran's expanding nuclear program "Significant ground scraping and landscaping have been undertaken over an extensive area at and around the location, with new dirt roads established," the report said. Iran must respond to the agency's concerns "without further delay." Otherwise, the U.N. body won't be able to resolve issues about Iran's nuclear program and "the existence of possible military dimensions" to the program, the report said. Many Western diplomats and nuclear experts believe the Parchin site has been secretly used to test high-explosive nuclear triggers, an essential step toward achieving a weapons capability. Iran denies that Parchin has any role in its nuclear program, which it insists is for peaceful purposes. A meeting in Vienna last week between IAEA officials and an Iranian delegation, which in part was to discuss access to the Parchin site, ended without progress. High stakes nuclear poker game in Iran? Iran acknowledges that it is increasing its number of centrifuges to enrich uranium. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said last month that 11,000 centrifuges were now operational, about 1,000 more than estimated by the IAEA in May. In a letter Wednesday to the agency, Iran said the allegations of nuclear activities at the Parchin site were "baseless," the report said. But the IAEA reasserted its ongoing alarm about Iran in Thursday's report. "Since 2002, the Agency has become increasingly concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile," the report said. World needs to keep 'maximum pressure' on Iran, Panetta says CNN's Michael Martinez and Tim Lister contributed to this report.
Manchester United needs a miracle to win the league title this year according to manager Louis van Gaal -- so what better way to start off than with the arrival of an angel. Angel Di Maria, the Argentina winger, completed his £59.7 million ($98.7m) move -- a British transfer record -- from Real Madrid Tuesday on a five-year deal, the club announced on its official website. "I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester United. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Spain and there were a lot of clubs interested in me, but United is the only club that I would have left Real Madrid for," said Di Maria. "Angel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player. There is no doubting his immense natural talent," Van Gaal said after clinching the signing. "He is an excellent addition to the team." But on the day the 26-year-old arrived at Old Trafford, the club suffered an embarrassing exit from the English League Cup at MK Dons -- thrashed 4-0 by the third flight side. Goals from Will Grigg in either half and a late double from Benik Afobe saw an admittedly understrength United team humiliated. The shock defeat comes after United failed to win either of its two Premier League games following a home defeat by Swansea and a draw at Sunderland. The arrival of Di Maria is something of a coup for a club without the lure of Champions League football given the Argentine was recently described by his fellow countryman and Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone as Real Madrid's "best player." He also starred for Argentina in its run to the World Cup final in Brazil, but missed the semifinal win over Van Gaal's Netherlands and the final defeat to Germany due to a thigh injury. However there are reservations over whether United should have used the money to improve other areas of the squad. "I think he himself is an excellent signing," Miguel Delaney, football writer for the Independent and the Blizzard told CNN. "It remains staggering that Real are selling him, given he tied their formation together last season -- but it sums up so much of the current United that a signing like that can still leave so many questions. "He is now the club's primary signing, yet it hasn't addressed the two primary issues with the squad -- central defense and central midfield. "At the very least, he offers pace, and trickery, and will give the side some of the thrust it lacked against Sunderland. "But United also needs players further back to offer that platform. It's difficult to have any quibbles with the signing of Di Maria. You can, however, have quibbles with signing him without purchasing more necessary players." United endured a disastrous time last season as David Moyes, the man who replaced Alex Ferguson, was sacked just 10 months after taking over at Old Trafford. The club finished seventh in the Premier League and missed out on qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 1995. Ryan Giggs took over the reins following Moyes' exit in April before van Gaal was appointed in July. United have brought in midfielder Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao, teenager Luke Shaw from Southampton and defender Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon. But Di Maria is the marquee signing -- the winger who played such a key role for Argentina in the World Cup and Real Madrid's Champions League triumph. Real paid around $60 million for Di Maria in 2010 following the player's successful time with Benfica in Portuguese football where he won the league title and the domestic cup on two occasions. During his time in the Spanish capital, Di Maria became an important part of the side which won the Spanish league title in 2012. He was also a key member of the team which won "La Decima" -- Real's 10th European Cup triumph with a dramatic victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2014 final. But his chances of first team football with Carlo Ancelotti's side have been limited since the arrival of James Rodriguez. The Colombian, one of the stars of the World Cup in Brazil, joined the club last month in a deal worth a reported $121 million. Real also completed the $34 million signing of Germany World Cup winner Toni Kroos in July as it bolstered its midfield options. Di Maria will hope to make his United debut against Burnley on Saturday at Turf Moor, with Van Gaal hoping his team can hit back after its sorry start to the season. The previous British transfer record was set by Chelsea in 2011 when they paid £50 million ($83m) to sign Fernando Torres from Liverpool.
Can Hewlett-Packard's motion-tracking webcams see black people? It's a question posed on a now-viral YouTube video and the company says it's looking into it. In the video, two co-workers take turns in front of the camera -- the webcam appears to follow Wanda Zamen as she sways in front of the screen and stays still as Desi Cryer moves about. HP acknowledged in a statement e-mailed to CNN that the cameras may have issues with contrast recognition in certain lighting situations. The webcams, built into HP's new computers, are supposed to keep people's faces and bodies in proportion and centered on the screen as they move. The video went viral over the weekend, garnering more than 400,000 YouTube page views and a slew of comments on Twitter. It was something neither Zamen nor Cryer expected to happen. Zamen said she and Cryer, her co-worker, were playing around with the computer at work and testing it when they stumbled upon the facial recognition feature. Cryer and Zamen said they were laughing when they realized the camera followed her and not him. "We thought it was pretty funny, we thought it was hilarious," Zamen said. So they made a video, which they planned to just share with friends on Facebook and YouTube. There was no script, no rehearsal, just two friends filming what they thought was a hilarious software glitch. So again, the two took turns in front of the camera. "As soon as my blackness enters the frame, it stopped," Cryer says in the video. "Black Desi gets in there, no face recognition anymore, buddy," he says. YouTube.com: Watch the video "I think my blackness is interfering with the computer's ability to follow me," he continues. But now that the video has gotten so much attention, the two co-workers want everyone, including HP, to know they never intended the video to spark a discussion about whether the webcam was racist. Zamen said she liked the computer so much, she suggested Cryer get one for his wife. "The intent was definitely not to go after HP, it just so happened the computer was an HP and we recognized the software glitch," Cryer said. "We did it for laughs, but if the video does make HP put out a better product, then great," Zamen added. HP was quick to react, too. The company quickly posted on the it's blog, TheNextBench.com, on Sunday after the video went viral, responding to concerns. "The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose," wrote Tony Welch, the lead social media strategist for HP's Personal Systems Group. "We believe that the camera might have difficulty 'seeing' contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting." TheNextBench.com: Read the statement on HP's blog Meanwhile, Welch pointed users facing similar problems to HP's help page, which provides guidance on how to change the lighting or other optimization settings on the camera. HP.com: See the HP help page On Monday HP also told CNN in a corporate statement that the issue is most likely related to lighting, but they are looking into the situation further. "HP has been informed of a potential issue with facial-tracking software. Consistent with other webcams, proper foreground lighting is required for the product to effectively track any person and their movements," the statement said. "As with all our products, we continue to explore refinements which help to optimize their use." Cryer and Zamen said they've heard similar feedback from commenters online offering ideas on fixing the lighting. The co-workers' video has also sparked others to try the product. After media coverage of the YouTube video, Consumer Reports did its own testing of the product to see if the YouTube video portrayal was accurate. ConsumerReports.org: Watch testing of the webcam feature In standard lighting, the webcam didn't move with an African-American male as it did with a white male. But after lighting sources were added, the webcam was able to track the African-American male's face and movements. CNN's Mythili Rao and Rachel Sherman contributed to this report.
occurred in Tennessee. Three of those people died in a fire in Knox County, Tennessee emergency management officials said. Family members said a man, woman and their adult son died in the fire, according to CNN affiliate WATE. Firefighters said they had difficulty reaching them because the second level of the house collapsed onto the lower level, WATE reported. Other people in Tennessee died from hypothermia and in auto accidents, WATE said, and a dialysis patient died after he was unable to get treatment because of weather. More than 2,700 people are without power as more severe cold, freezing rain and snow are predicted for the next few days, Tennessee officials said. Dangerously cold conditions continue to grip a large part of the Eastern United States, CNN meteorologists said, with more than 125 million Americans under a wind chill warning or advisory. Wind chills will go as low as 40 below zero in some places. Snow, sleet, and freezing rain will spread over the mid-South and into the mid-Atlantic over the next couple of days. Ice storm warnings are in effect for Nashville, where heavy ice accumulation could again cause widespread power outages. Winter storm warnings again cover much of Kentucky, which saw as much as 15 inches from the last storm. More heavy snow is predicted for Louisville and Cincinnati. The storm will spread up the East Coast this weekend. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.
The Japanese women's soccer team won the World Cup after defeating the United States on penalty kicks Sunday night, rallying from a pair of one-goal deficits to capture its first-ever world title. Japan had come into the tournament as sentimental favorites, helping rally a nation that had been devastated by a March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami and nuclear disaster. For the United States, it was more a disappointment -- especially considering that the team twice relinquished leads. While  the U.S. had the most chances during the run of play, the Japanese  dominated the penalty-kick phase 3-1 to earn the win. The Americans dug  themselves a hole by missing their first three kicks. "We lost to a great team, we really did," U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo told ESPN, which broadcast the game. "I truly believe that something bigger was pulling for this team." Americans gathered in bars, living rooms and other places rode an emotional roller coaster, their hopes high on multiple occassions only to be dashed in the end. Japanese residents were also glued to their televisions, despite the game starting around 4 a.m. local time. In one Tokyo eatery, for instances, scores adorned in the team's colors burst out in joy once their team beat the U.S. squad for the first time in 26 tries. The shoot-out was mandated only after Japanese midfielder Homare Sawa scored with a few minutes left in extra time, tying the score 2-2. Japan answered a U.S. goal -- also in the overtime period -- when U.S. forward Abby Wambach put her team ahead by heading home a pass from Alex Morgan into the back of the net. There were many heroes for Japan. One of them was Aya Miyama, who tied up the score with 10 minutes left in regulation by finishing off a scramble in front of the net. Before then, Japan had its back against the wall after Morgan herself scored the game's first goal. This came after the Americans controlled much of the early action, but couldn't capitalize. In the first-half alone, a U.S. player hit a goal-post, and on another occasion, Wambach rattled the crossbar. Japan also had its own point-blank chance about 30 minutes into the game; that was saved by Solo, the American goalkeeper. It was more of the same in the second half, with Morgan ringing a ball off the post from several feet away just three minutes in. Then, Japanese goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori tapped a Wambach header just over the crossbar 15 minutes later. The game -- which began at 8:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. ET) in Frankfurt, Germany -- capped an eventful tournament that saw a number of favorites including Brazil, Sweden and the host nation of Germany fall by the wayside. The Japanese shocked the host nation in the quarterfinals. In that same round, the U.S. team needed last-minute heroics to beat Brazil and advance. Team USA had been hoping -- and ultimately failed -- to become the first squad to win the women's World Cup three times, having also captured the title in 1991 and 1999. Steve Sklar, one of tens of thousands of Americans who watched Sunday's game, said the U.S. team succeeded in getting many of his countrymen excited about the sport. "Anything that gets soccer played in the United States is great," Sklar told CNN from a New York bar, minutes after the contest ended. "And the fact that so many watched this game is awesome." While the U.S. team played for bragging rights and to boost the sport's profile in their home country, Japanese players were hoping to give their citizens something to smile about after this spring's massive earthquake and tsunami. "To be in the final is, to be honest, like a dream," Japanese player Homare Sawa told FIFA before the game. "We know USA are a great and strong team, but they have weak points, too, and there's always a chance to score." The Japanese players had won over their share of fans, with Solo of the U.S. team calling them "the sentimental favorites" for helping to lift the spirits of their devastated nation. "They're playing for something bigger and better than the game," the American goalkeeper said in a conference call prior to the match. "When you are playing with so much heart, that's hard to play against." The U.S. team, meanwhile, captured the hearts of Americans for its creativity, dazzling plays and free spirit. Their white-knuckle wins kept fans engrossed and revamped interest years after the team's last win in 1999, before a packed house at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke by phone with the U.S. team Sunday before the game, wishing the players good luck and telling them that America is proud of how well they've done. "I just got the highest hopes that this great team, which has shown such resilience, will be coming back and winning for the U.S.," Clinton told reporters, adding that she plans to watch the game from Greece. Her daughter Chelsea Clinton was among those attending Sunday's game in Frankfurt, part of a delegation that included Jill Biden, wife of the U.S. vice president. "This country needed someone to cheer for," said Cat Whitehill, who played on the last two U.S. World Cup teams, after the game. "To see the support from so many different people, it's really neat to see." The U.S. team was known for its energy, often evident in the locker room where the players were known to sing and dance. On the field, Swedish-born head coach Pia Sundhage said she trained them to play with verve and openness. "I guess there's a reason they hired me from a foreign country," Sundhage said. "They wanted change. It was risky to make too big of a change because then (the team) would lose a lot of confidence." The team faced a Japanese squad that was faster and more tactical than most they'd faced, some American players said. "They are the biggest surprise in the tournament," U.S. defender Ali Krieger said of her opponents, prior to Sunday's match. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.
Sen. John McCain's campaign has told Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty he will not be the GOP vice presidential nominee in November, sources told CNN on Friday. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty suggested in a radio interview that he won't be Sen. John McCain's VP pick. Pawlenty on Friday also told WCCO Radio in Minneapolis-St. Paul that he will not be in Dayton, Ohio, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to unveil his choice of a running mate at a rally later Friday. The McCain campaign said it's hoping to have 15,000 people at the Ohio event, roughly five times the size of his largest crowd to date. A Republican source said McCain settled on his choice of a running mate at a meeting of his advisers Wednesday. Thursday night's arrival of a private jet from Alaska at the Middleton, Ohio, airport raised speculation that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin would be McCain's pick. Middleton is 25 miles from Dayton. Rich Bevis, an airport manager at the Middleton airport, said that a woman, two men and two teenagers were onboard.  Watch conservative analyst Bill Bennett mull Palin as a VP pick » "This is the most secretive flight we've ever had," Bevis said. In June, Palin told CNN that she thought McCain should choose a governor as his running mate and that she would like to serve on a national level, "but I don't think it's going to happen on this go-round though."   Watch Palin say she won't be VP this time » In an interview with a Pennsylvania radio station that was taped Wednesday and aired Thursday, McCain said he had not settled on a nominee. The Associated Press reported that the interview with KDKA radio had occurred Thursday, which created confusion as to whether McCain had finalized his choice for vice president.  Watch who is on McCain's shortlist » Asked whether either former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge or former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was his VP pick, McCain replied to KDKA, "I haven't decided yet, so I can't tell you." Both men are expected to join McCain at a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania. Ridge, who is also the former secretary of homeland security, is reportedly on McCain's shortlist of possible running mates. A Republican insider said this month that McCain campaign manager Rick Davis has called several state party chairmen and indicated that Ridge will be the Republican vice presidential pick this cycle. During his interview with KDKA, McCain praised Ridge, saying, "He's a great American and a great and dear friend, and I rely on him, and I have for many years." But the possibility that Ridge could be McCain's running mate sparked a backlash among conservatives because he supports abortion rights. Another potential VP pick, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, also raised concerns among conservatives. Lieberman, an independent senator who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee, has been a vocal supporter of the war in Iraq, but he, too, backs abortion rights. If McCain picks either man, it could drive away social conservatives who are already uneasy about his nomination, conservative activists warned. In an open letter to McCain, conservative activist Richard A. Viguerie wrote, "Your indication that you're willing to put a person who has a clear, unequivocal pro-abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming." "Sen. McCain, you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick -- you wear it as a badge of honor. Well, poke the base of the Republican Party -- the conservatives -- in the eye one more time by choosing a pro-abortion vice presidential candidate, and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game," Viguerie said. Romney ran against McCain this year for the GOP presidential nomination and was a frequent critic of the senator on the campaign trail. But Romney endorsed McCain after he captured the Republican nomination and has campaigned for him. He also opposes abortion rights, a position he said he came to in 2004 after studying the stem cell-issue as Massachusetts governor. Before then, Romney was in favor of abortion rights.

Federal drug officials say they've arrested 124 people and busted 56 labs in the largest illegal steroid investigation in U.S. history. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it busted 56 steroid labs in 27 states. The 18-month investigation, dubbed "Operation Raw Deal," targeted traffickers who allegedly imported raw materials from China and used them to make anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and insulin growth factor, the Drug Enforcement Administration said. "Today we reveal the truth behind the underground steroid market: dangerous drugs cooked up all too often in filthy conditions with no regard to safety, giving Americans who purchase them the ultimate raw deal," DEA Administrator Karen Tandy said in a statement. Authorities made arrests in 27 states, including busts in Los Angeles, California; New York City; San Diego, California; Providence, Rhode Island; and Kansas City, Missouri. They seized more than 530 pounds of raw materials and 11.4 million steroid dosage units in the United States, officials said, enough to supply hundreds of users. Most of the arrests were made between Thursday and Sunday, the DEA said. Chinese authorities cooperated with the investigation, which targeted 37 companies in China, the DEA said. So far, one Chinese lab has been shut down, officials said. The Chinese "have done everything" they were asked to do, said DEA spokesman Rusty Payne.  Watch DEA officials say bust is only the beginning » The operation, according to the DEA, also cracked down on underground trafficking of counterfeit medications as well as Web sites that were distributing materials that helped in converting raw steroid ingredients into the finished product. "DEA successfully attacked the illegal steroid industry at every level of its distribution network-from the manufacturers in China who supply the raw materials, to the traffickers in the United States who market the deadly doses," the DEA statement said. Besides China, other countries which cooperated in the operation included Mexico, Canada, Belgium, Australia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Thailand, officials said. E-mail to a friend
An online campaign to get One Direction to visit a Colorado teen critically wounded at school has led to a video message from the British boy band. Claire Davis, 17, is in a coma in a Littleton, Colorado, hospital six days after another senior at Arapahoe High School shot her and then took his own life. Friends, who said Davis is a big One Direction fan, began a Twitter campaign to get the group's attention using the hashtag #Get1DtoClaire. The group recorded a 13-second video message and sent it directly to Claire's family, a source close to One Direction told CNN Thursday. While it was not intended to be shared online, her boyfriend apparently uploaded it to YouTube, the source said. The video shows singer Liam Payne delivering the message as the other four members stand by. "Hi, Claire. We've heard you were a big fan and we just wanted to show you some love," Payne said. "What's happened to you is absolutely terrible, something we can't bear thinking about, so we just wanted to share some love with you. All our prayers are with you and your family. Hope you get well soon. Lots of love." Louis Tomlinson then blew a kiss toward the camera. The group couldn't be with Claire, but wanted to do something for her, the source said. Claire Davis described as sweet, smart, a horse lover Word of the One Direction video spread quickly on Twitter Thursday. "Guys 1D found out about Claire," read one tweet linking to the YouTube message. "In case you haven't seen this....#get1Dtoclaire worked!!!! So so proud of everyone," said another. The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Karl Pierson, was looking for revenge against a librarian, but couldn't find the faculty member. He killed himself as a school resource officer closed in, police said. Davis was a random victim, police surmised, and the gunman and victim didn't know each other. Colorado school shooter planned larger attack, Sheriff's Office says CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.
Yemen'shighest military authority Sunday announced its willingness to open channels of dialogue with al Qaeda in hopes of reaching a long-term cease-fire agreement. The military committee was formed as part of the power transfer deal in November. Spokesman Ali Saeed Obaid told CNN that the new Yemeni military leadership is opening its hands and will seek new solutions with al Qaeda fighters. Al Qaeda currently controls large areas in the southern Abyan and Shabwa provinces of Yemen. "We are offering al Qaeda a chance to be involved in the political decisions in the country through politics, rather than forcing their views with the use of arms," Obaid said. Vice President Abdurabu Hadi is chairman of the committee, which is responsible for rebuilding the Yemeni military. "The committee is hoping that al Qaeda lays down its arms and participates in seeking change democratically, like the millions in Yemen," Obaid said, adding that al Qaeda would in return handover all territories under its control to the military and evacuate government posts. Al Qaeda has not yet responded to the offer, the committee said. Yemen's government is in the midst of a transfer of power in which President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a longtime United States ally in the war on terrorism, has agreed to step down after more than 33 years of rule. Islamist militants seized control of Abyan last May after government positions were suddenly emptied. The province was announced an Islamic emirate a week later, resulting in hundreds of fighters joining their lines. Hundreds of troops and fighters have been killed daily as part of their efforts to rid the province of the fighters. More than 100,000 residents of Abyan evacuated the province when clashes intensified last July. They are currently living in shelters in the neighboring provinces of Aden and Lahj. Last month, a committee formed by Hadi persuaded al Qaeda fighters in Radda, in the nearby province of al-Baitha, to evacuate the area two weeks after they took it over. Suspected al Qaeda fighters left the town after five days of tense negotiations in exchange for the release of three prisoners, Hadi's office said at the time.
A pilot performing stunts in an east Florida air show died in a fiery crash Saturday when the Russian military plane he was flying broke from formation and plummeted to the ground, officials said. No one else was injured, the spokesman said. The incident occured at around 4:30 p.m. E.T. in Bunnell, Florida, at Flagler County Airport, according to Carl Laundrie, the county's communications director. Bunnell is about 25 miles north of Daytona Beach. The pilot, William E. Walker, 58, of Cookeville, Tennessee,was performing at the 2nd Annual Wings over Flagler air show when the crash occurred, according to a media release from the Florida Highway Patrol. The release stated that the crash was not alcohol related. "During the aerial demonstration, the pilot lost control of the aircraft by unknown reasons," the highway patrol release stated. The pilot crashed about a half-mile from spectators attending the event, causing the 1983 Aerostar YAK-52 Russian military trainer aircraft he was flying to burst into flames, according to the highway patrol. The pilot was pronounced dead at the scene, the release stated. The fire was quickly extinguished and the remainder of the Saturday air show was canceled, Laundrie said. Event organizers plan to resume the show on Sunday, Laundrie said. Specialists with the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were headed to the crash site Saturday to open an investigation of the crash, according to the highway patrol.

While most voters this year have said the economy or Iraq is their top priority, some Mississippi voters have a different focus -- recovering from Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina ravaged Biloxi, Mississippi, when the storm tore through in 2005. Mississippi, which holds its primaries on Tuesday, was hit hard by the storm in 2005. Two-and-half years later, the evidence of the damage is all too clear. "Some folks care, some people just don't," said John Nutter, who lives in Biloxi. His brother Derrel cries as he speaks of the house his father built. The mortgage company just foreclosed on the family home -- the home he grew up in.  Watch the brothers talk about their struggle » Mark Jones, president of Urban Life Missions, moved to the battered Gulf Coast region to help people in need. Jones says his organization doesn't have the money to help the Nutter family. "Everything the candidates are talking about is important to the candidates, but I don't believe it's hitting the pulse of what's happened to the Gulf and the people here," he said. Katrina was "the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history," according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It devastated more than 90,000 square miles, led to the displacement of 270,000 Americans and inflicted more than $81 billion in damage. But the irony is as families are still struggling to get back on their feet, casino business in Biloxi is booming. Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway says the casinos raked in more than a billion dollars in gross revenue this year. That money has gone toward new schools, but individual homeowners need something else. "We still need to have some type of stimulus, that the government could come in, that they could put in some businesses. ... Something like that, that can bring more people in here, more money and better jobs," he said. A recent poll shows Sen. Barack Obama leading Sen. Hillary Clinton 58-34 percent in Mississippi. The American Research Group poll questioned 600 likely Democratic primary voters and has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The poll was conducted March 5-6. Clinton and Obama have been talking about their plan for Gulf Coast recovery as they've campaigned in Mississippi, which has 33 delegates at stake. "When Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast, the president did not respond," Clinton told supporters in Canton, Mississippi. "I have said that I will do whatever I can to make up for lost time as your president." Clinton said she would have someone in the White House who is responsible for updating her on the rebuilding process every day. Obama on Monday vowed that the "failed policies of the last 7 years" -- including Hurricane Katrina -- will be over next year. "If we're spending $12 billion a month in Iraq, we can spend some of that money right here in the United States of America, rebuilding roads and bridges and hospitals and schools and putting people back to work all across Mississippi, rebuilding the Gulf Coast, rebuilding after the storm -- that work is not yet done," he said in Columbus. Looking ahead to Tuesday's primary, voters along the state's Gulf Coast say the next two years must be better regardless of who wins the White House, because things can't get any worse. "I'm going to be honest with you, I think in a few days we're going to be out on the streets. We've got nowhere else to go," John Nutter said. E-mail to a friend
Remember your first road trip? That sweet taste of independence as you were finally unleashed on America's free and open highways? For Pulitzer-winning automotive columnist Dan Neil, it was the day he turned 16 and passed his driving test. "The minute I got my drivers license out of the laminator, I was on the road," he recalled. "I took the longest road trip I could take." Neil pointed his Fiat 124 Spider convertible in the direction of the nearest city: Raleigh, North Carolina. "I just had to go man, I just had to drive. I must have put 500 miles on that car that day." Neil said he was part of a mindset that associated the automobile with freedom, mobility and self-determination. Then the excitement in Neil's voice disappeared. "That was in the mid-1970s, and the road system was a little bit different then." Indeed it was. The days of America's "free" and open roads are gone -- or perhaps they never existed at all. Drivers often forget that they pay for highway construction and maintenance through federal fuel taxes: 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. "The notion that the road has ever been free is sort of a self-delusion," said Neil. Opinion: Five myths about the highway fuel tax But the fuel tax is running out of steam, experts warn, because more efficient vehicles are using less fuel and rising fuel prices discourage driving. As tax revenue falls, so does the nation's ability to pay for road construction and maintenance. The solution, say many transportation experts, is to replace -- or supplement -- fuel taxes with a per-mile tax on every vehicle in America. Tax authorities might monitor each vehicle's mileage by installing devices that would transmit data. Unlike a fuel tax, which is somewhat hidden in the price of fuel, a device that spends your money with each tick of the odometer would be a real buzz-kill for millions of road tripping Americans. "It's just like a speed limit or a toll road or any other kind of interference," said Neil. "It steps on that conception we have of ourselves as a people without borders or boundaries. You step on our ability to take to the open road." The bottom line So, what kind of money are we talking about here? Translated into dollars and cents, fuel taxes cost each vehicle owner about $250 a year on average. According to a University of Iowa study, paying that amount on a per-mile basis would come to about 1.6 cents per mile. Whether it is paid for through fuel taxes or taxing per-mile, it's clear the federal highway fund is in trouble. By the end of 2012, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the fund will "be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner" unless Congress injects even more life support from the general Treasury. During the next 20 years, projections show average vehicle fuel efficiency nearly doubling. Revenues from the fuel tax will be slashed by half, according to the Iowa study. Meanwhile, the cost of safe roads, bridges and transit systems will skyrocket. By 2020, says the American Society of Engineers, the price tag could be as high as $1.7 trillion. Bottom line: two cents per mile would be enough to pay for the nation's transportation infrastructure needs. That's according to a 2009 nonpartisan commission headed by two former U.S. transportation secretaries. 'The Man,' with a capital M Imagine 254 million vehicles. That's the number of cars, trucks and motorcycles that a tax per mile system would have to monitor. Some proposals call for using GPS satellites to gather mileage data on each vehicle. Whoa. Really? When it comes to tracking their vehicles, Americans tend to be really touchy about protecting their privacy. According to a University of Iowa poll, only about 20% of drivers would choose a pay-per-mile tax system if GPS tracking is involved. The anonymous driver will soon be an extinct species, says Neil. "You can't drop off the grid. Ten years from now, it will be virtually impossible to drive a car that doesn't have an electronic signature," said Neil. "It doesn't matter whether you have OnStar or you rent a car -- it's going to have a 'black box.' If you've got any kind of navigation, The Man -- with a capital M -- knows where you are." University of Iowa research shows that the public would be more willing to accept per-mile taxes if its monitoring technology doesn't record a vehicle's specific location. Taking your vehicle to have someone read the odometer every year -- like some states do with emissions testing -- might be an option. But some experts fear that method might be too expensive. Also, the resulting once-a-year tax bill might be too much for some drivers to pay. One idea tested in Minnesota eliminates GPS and uses cell phone text messaging technology. During fuel stops at gas stations, a device that already exists in most cars would text the car's mileage information to a "back office" data base. The office would then adjust the price of fuel at the pump based on each vehicle's mileage driven. Implementing any system would be tricky, says Paul Hanley, who headed the Iowa study. Retrofitting existing cars with the required technology would be almost impossible, he says. The cheapest and least difficult option says Hanely, would be to install devices in new cars and slowly transition to the new system as the nation's entire fleet of vehicles turns over. It takes about eight years before 90% of our vehicles are turned over, Hanley says, and more than 10 years to convert the fleet to nearly 100%. "It's inevitable," says Hanley, who's been conducting a real-world test of a pay-per-mile system with more than 2,500 drivers in 12 locations from coast-to-coast. Per-mile taxes "with a combination of tolls is coming as we move away from the fuel tax." Several states in addition to Iowa and Minnesota are looking into possible pay-per-mile tax systems, including Oregon and Texas. Don't bother, some argue Leave well-enough alone, says the American Trucking Associations' Darrin Roth, who argues that taxing vehicles per mile is too expensive to implement and administer. Those costs would be passed on to consumers, Roth says. The best and least complicated solution is to raise the fuel tax, which hasn't changed since 1993. But that idea comes with its own set of political challenges. Many members of Congress would likely oppose any kind of tax hike. "I'm not convinced per-mile taxes are going to happen," says Roth. "If it does, it probably won't happen for a long time." Despite all the changes technology may bring to the driving experience, "the American road will still be out there," says Neil. "It's fun and it's incredibly broadening for people ... and it's a great way to spend time with your family," he says. "It might not be as innocent as it used to be, but it's still an important part of who we are as a people." How to pay for that highway remains a question Americans will debate for a while -- perhaps for years down the road.
A political summit between President Barack Obama and congressional leaders Tuesday yielded further talks on how to extend Bush-era tax breaks scheduled to expire at the end of the year, as well as an acknowledgement from Obama that he needs to reach out more to Republicans. The meeting, dubbed by some the "Slurpee summit" for a campaign dig by Obama at congressional Republicans, involved the president and leaders of both parties from the House and Senate. It came in the aftermath of the November midterm election in which Republicans took control of the House and gained six seats in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Originally proposed by Obama as a half-day event that could extend into dinner, the meeting was postponed once by Republican leaders and ended up lasting about two hours. Afterward, Obama and Republican leaders said they wanted to work together, but they also made clear that sharp differences exist on major issues. "There are real philosophical differences, deeply held principles to which each party holds," Obama said. "And although the atmosphere in today's meeting was extremely civil, there's no doubt that those differences are going to remain no matter how many meetings we have." Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the expected incoming House speaker, said the fact that the meeting was civil did not guarantee success or progress. "We've had a lot of nice meetings," Boehner said. "The question is whether we can find common ground." Both Obama and congressional Republicans emphasized the talks on the tax cut issue as a major issue in the meeting. "That process is beginning right away, and we expect to get some answers back in the next couple of days," Obama said. However, he cautioned that both parties still have deep disagreements, even as they attempt to find "sensible common ground" on the tax provisions. Boehner said talks involving the treasury secretary, White House budget officials and members of Congress from both parties will examine the tax issue. The congressional negotiators will be Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland for the Democrats, with Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan for the Republicans. However, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky indicated that there is little leeway in the GOP stance, saying that all Senate Republicans and some Democrats want all the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 to be extended. Obama and the Senate Republicans described the talks as civil and frank. Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia said he was encouraged that Obama acknowledged that he should have reached out more to Republicans in his first two years in office and that Tuesday's meeting would be the first in a series of discussions on working together. Boehner also said Obama conceded not spending enough time working with Republicans. During the election campaign, Obama and Democrats repeatedly characterized Republicans as obstructionists with a policy of opposition to everything proposed by Democrats in order to score political points. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs confirmed that Obama told the GOP leaders that he needed to do a better job in seeking consensus. "I think the president laid out that in order for us to work together, we're going to have to communicate," Gibbs said. "The president was pretty clearly in acknowledging that he needed to do better, and he would." Asked whether Obama was bending to Republicans by saying he needed to reach out more to them, Gibbs said: "I'm not sure I call that bending; I call that trying to work together." In remarks after the event, Obama said he invited Republican and Democratic leaders to meet with him again several times in the future, including one summit at Camp David. On the tax cut issue, Obama has called for Congress to extend the lower tax rates for most Americans before they expire December 31. The president's proposal would extend the lower rates for people earning up to $200,000 a year or families earning up to $250,000 while allowing the rates for those earning more to return to the higher levels of the 1990s. Republicans want the lower tax rates extended for all Americans regardless of income level. A possible compromise floated by Democrats would raise the income threshold for the lower rates to those earning up to $1 million. McConnell said Republicans oppose differing policies for different taxpayers, based on income. "It is the view of 100 percent of Senate republicans and a number of Senate Democrats as well that ... we ought to treat all tax rates the same," McConnell said. Another issue expected to come up at the meeting was a new nuclear arms treaty with Russia. The START treaty, which requires Senate approval, would resume mutual inspections of U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each. Obama has called approval of the treaty an immediate priority, saying it's critical to national security and a cornerstone of U.S.-Russian relations. However, 10 GOP senators -- led by Kyl -- have urged a delay until the next Congress over concerns about the current Senate workload and the need to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In particular, Kyl and McConnell complain that Senate Democrats want to push through Democratic proposals in the current lame-duck session before their larger majority goes down in the new Congress in January. McConnell said Tuesday that issues such as repealing the "don't ask, don't tell" policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers and the DREAM Act -- which would create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the country as children and get a college degree or complete two years of military service -- were less important than the tax rate issue and a needed agreement on government funding for the rest of the fiscal year, which expires at the end of September. Gibbs, however, said Obama and Democrats believe that all of the pending issues are important to Americans and that there is plenty of time for the Senate to take them up in the lame-duck session that runs through December. Boehner and McConnell, in a piece that appeared on The Washington Post website Tuesday, said Republicans and Democrats can work together. "The clock may be winding down on this session of Congress, but there is still time to do the right thing," the opinion article stated. "If President Obama and Democratic leaders put forward a plan during the lame-duck session to cut spending and stop the tax hikes on all Americans, they can count on a positive response from Republicans. If the president and Democratic leaders don't act before the end of the year, however, House and Senate Republicans will work to get the job done in the new Congress. But we hope it doesn't come to that." During midterm election campaigning, Obama often used a car analogy to describe his efforts, backed by congressional Democrats, to help the U.S. economy recover from a recession they inherited. His stump speech described Democrats working to "dig the car out of the ditch" while Republicans sat back "sipping on a Slurpee," a frozen drink. When Obama originally proposed the meeting with congressional leaders, White House reporters immediately called it a "Slurpee summit." "Let's hope the president will be willing to work with us to cut spending, stop the tax hikes and get our economy working again," Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said this month. "Then we can all go get Slurpees together." CNN's Ed Henry, Tom Cohen and Dana Bash contributed to this report.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is using his claims of a successful rocket launch to shore up his political strength within his country. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses North Korea on CNN's "American Morning" on Tuesday. Albright, who was secretary of state in the Clinton administration, told CNN's "American Morning" that "it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea" when the Bush administration took over. The communist nation launched the rocket over the weekend in defiance of international opposition. Satellite images released Monday appear to show the rocket in flight, according to a  nonprofit institution that focuses on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The following is a transcript of Albright's conversation with CNN's Carol Costello. Carol Costello, CNN: We do have this video from North Korea of this rocket taking off. What do you make of that? Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: Well, I think that the North Korean leadership is living in a parallel universe of acting as if the launch was a success, when tracking and everything has shown that in fact, it is a failure. And I think it proves a point, which is that the North Koreans, Kim Jong-Il is doing this for his own internal reasons -- because on Thursday, tomorrow, there will be a rubber stamp by the parliament of his leadership -- and the problems that he's generally had since he had his stroke. So this is part of their kind of Orwellian approach of saying that "This is what happened, and wasn't it a success," when we know it wasn't. Costello: The U.N. Security Council hasn't been able to come up with any sort of resolution because apparently that body is split. President Obama made a really big deal of this and said this was like a clear violation. It sort of seems like the United States is stuck, and it can't do anything about North Korea. Albright: Well, I don't think that's true, because what has happened is there have been individual condemnations by leaders of various countries. And I have to say from my own experience of the United Nations, it does take a while to get the 15 members [of the Security Council] together. But the saddest for me is the fact that the U.N. passed a resolution, 1718, which said that this was not acceptable. So the truth is that the U.N. has to live up to its own resolutions. And Ambassador Rice, I think, is working very hard up there in order to get some action, but there have been condemnations already throughout the world. And the bottom line here is that President Obama's speech, for instance, in Prague, when he talked about the importance of cooperation generally on a whole nonproliferation regime -- it's very clear that there's going to have to be a lot of work on that and that President Obama laid out a very, very important set of goals. amFIX: Your thoughts on the rocket launch Costello: And, you know, there has been some criticism that President Obama turned to the U.N. to try to solve this crisis. I want to read you a quote from Politico. It interviewed Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. I want to read you his quote. Newt Gingrich said, "The embarrassing repudiation of the United States appeal to the United Nations Security Council Sunday afternoon is a vivid demonstration of weakness. This is beginning to resemble the Carter administration's weakness in foreign policy." How would you respond to that? Albright: Well, I think that it's just kind of typical of Newt Gingrich, frankly. But the bottom line here is, I think the United States and President Obama has made very clear the leadership of the United States, his concern about, generally, proliferation issues. I think his trip, for instance, laid out a whole set of issues that prove that American leadership is essential, the respect that he gained for American leadership. And I think you're going to see additional ways that we all work together, because the issues that are out there that have to be dealt with require cooperation, and they will require international organizations and cooperation through NATO and a number of activities. So I'm very confident that President Obama is going to be able to prove American leadership. Costello: Well, I guess many Americans look at it this way, you know: You talk about sanctions, but sanctions have been instituted against North Korea before, and it hasn't really worked. North Korea just seems to kind of do what it wants. You've met Kim Jong-Il. I mean, what does he want? Albright:  Well, what he wants is respect. And I have to say that part of the problem here is -- and as you mentioned, I met Kim Jong-Il. We were in the middle of negotiations with him. In fact, we had a missile moratorium. And President Bush came in and canceled those talks. It was confusing to everybody. And I do think that what is important now is to get the North Koreans back into the six-party talks, to make it clear to them that the only way that they are going to have respect is to abide by international regulations and to try to deal with the fact that they would be better off if, in fact, they allowed their people to be fed and an economy that functions, rather than be living in this way where poverty is rampant, and hunger, in every way in North Korea, and a leadership that is shaky. But the bottom line is, I think it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea. And in the interim period, they were able to develop material in order to create nuclear weapons, and so I hope very much that the six-party talks continue. Costello: We'll see. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. Thank you.
It was an election night like none other, in every sense of the phrase. In addition to the obvious -- the selection of the nation's first black president -- Tuesday night's coverage on CNN showcased groundbreaking technology. CNN's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York. "I want you to watch what we're about to do," CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer told viewers early in the evening's coverage, "because you've never seen anything like this on television." And he was right. Cue CNN political correspondent Jessica Yellin. "Hi Wolf!" said Yellin, waving to Blitzer as she stood a few feet in front of him in the network's New York City studios. Or at least, that's the way it appeared at first glance. In reality, Yellin -- a correspondent who had been covering Sen. Barack Obama's campaign -- was at the now president-elect's mega-rally along the lakefront in Chicago, Illinois, more than 700 miles away from CNN's Election Center in New York. It looked like a scene straight out of "Star Wars." Here was Yellin, partially translucent with a glowing blue haze around her, appearing to materialize in thin air. She even referenced the classic movie on her own, saying, "It's like I follow in the tradition of Princess Leia. It's something else."  Watch a behind-the-scenes look at CNN's hologram project » Jay Leno has poked fun at the hologram, and mash-up spoofs that replace Yellin's voice with Carrie Fisher's lines from the movie already are making their way around the Internet. But the million-dollar question on everyone's mind now: How'd they do it? CNN dubbed it a "hologram" -- a three-dimensional image that's been reproduced. And it's the brainchild of a few people. A hologram creates an image using coherent light, such as lasers; CNN's technique used conventional cameras to capture multiple images from different angles. "About a dozen years, I've been trying to do it," David Bohrman, CNN's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, said to Blitzer on "The Situation Room" on Wednesday. "I've basically been a crazy mad scientist trying to get it done." The technology involved placing a subject -- in this case Yellin, and later in the evening, musical artist Will.i.am -- in the middle of a bright-green circular room inside a large tent at Obama's Grant Park victory celebration. The subject was then filmed with 35 high-definition video cameras, barely larger than average point-and-shoot cameras, which ringed the wall of the circular room. The video cameras were 6 inches apart and at eye level, 220 degrees around the subject. Chuck Hurley, the Washington bureau's senior producer of video and the staffer tapped by Bohrman to manage the execution of the "hologram," called it simple chroma-key technology that's been taken "to the Nth degree."  Watch the hologram on air » "Weathermen have been standing in front of green screens for years now, but that's [with] one camera," Hurley said. "Now we can do that times 35, so you can send all the way around the subject." Hurley said the tiny cameras "talk" to the New York studio's cameras, meaning that when a New York camera moves, it "tells" the cameras in the tent which direction it's moving and keeps the subject in the correct proportions. On Tuesday night, Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio. Technicians placed a round piece of red laminate on the studio floor where she was "beamed in" so that Blitzer would know where to look. The technology in play was originally developed by Israeli-based company SportVU (pronounced "sport view") as a new way of filming soccer games. Gal Oz, a SportVU designer who came to the United States to work with CNN on the endeavor, said it was originally designed "to create a matrix effect in sports" -- in other words, to provide 360 degrees of perspective for instant replays. But it hasn't been used for its intended purpose yet. Instead, for the past three months, the company has been perfecting it for CNN's election coverage, Oz said. Tuesday night's live interview of Yellin was essentially the technology's world debut as well. Hurley and Oz agree that as good as the image looked on television Tuesday, it can look even more realistic. Hurley said the blue glow around Yellin and Will.i.am was added intentionally to avoid confusion. "We could have had a much crisper, more realistic shot, almost to the extent where the viewer at home would have had no idea even that the person wasn't really there," Hurley said. "You don't want to have the effect where it looks so good that for every future live shot, you have people on the blogs saying, 'Oh they're not really there--they're in a studio, faking the moon landing.' " Hurley said considering it was CNN's first real "test launch" with the high-end gadgetry, they were "beyond thrilled." That's not to say there weren't setbacks. For all the preparation that went into the tent and green room in Chicago -- a location CNN staffers dubbed "Casper" after the friendly cartoon ghost -- there was an equally elaborate setup in Phoenix, Arizona, site of John McCain's election night rally. CNN correspondent Dana Bash was ready there for her turn in the portal as well. But because the Arizona site didn't go through as much testing in the final hours, and because the election was called in Obama's favor earlier in the evening than many expected, Chicago's "Casper" was the only "hologram' venue put to use. Hurley and Oz both said they couldn't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology. But could this become a staple of future TV news? "We'll see. It was a little ornament on the tree," Bohrman said. "But television evolves, and how we do things evolves, and at some point -- maybe it's five years or 10 years or 20 years down the road -- I think there's going to be a way that television does interviews like this because it allows for a much more intimate possibility for a remote interview." The day after her virtual appearance in New York, Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining, even when it's presenting important political stories. "We do serious journalism, but we also have fun. This is fun. This is about what we can do, about pushing the envelope and pushing the boundaries," she said. "Someday when this is even more advanced, having a fuller visual field for interview subjects could give viewers even more of a sense of people." Now, in hindsight, Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better "Star Wars" joke. "I was thinking of making an Obi-Wan Kenobi joke -- Obi-Wolf Kenobi," she said, laughing, "but I couldn't figure out the pun."
Librarians across the United States are making noise about new federal restrictions on lead that could take books out of the hands of children. Children's books are covered by federal regulations on lead in items made for children. The Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvement Act requires all products, including books intended for children younger than 12, to meet new standards calling for lower lead content. Commission regulations, written in response to the law, take effect February 10. Even stricter limits will become effective in August. Paper, ink, covers and glues would need to pass lead content standards. "While we understand the process the CPSC must carry out in order to ensure this law is properly enforced and that the safety of our nation's children is protected, we believe the commission is wasting time and resources by zeroing in on book publishers and libraries," said Emily Sheketoff, executive director of the American Library Association Washington office. "It is our hope that this matter will be resolved soon, so that libraries can continue their efforts to serve children without the threat of closing their doors." The CPSC is expected to issue guidance early next week, said Lisa Ackerman, spokeswoman for Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, who sponsored the legislation in the Senate last year. The bill, sponsored in the House by Rep. Bobby L. Rush, D-Illinois, was prompted by a rash of recalls of lead- and phthalate-tainted products, many of which were manufactured in China. Long-term exposure to lead can cause nervous system and kidney damage; speech, language, hearing and behavioral problems; and learning difficulties, according to the Mayo Clinic's Web site. Pryor is frustrated with the product safety commission. "The new law is not and was not intended to be a one-size-fits-all mandate," he said in an earlier statement. "There is simply no excuse for the CPSC's slow action on these rulemakings." A consumer advocate concurred with Pryor. "I don't think the law needs to be adjusted," said David Arkush, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch division. "The law provides means for the CPSC to evaluate and decide whether exemptions should be granted for certain types of products." CPSC spokeswoman Arlene Flecha said the agency would comment on the issue later Friday. Ordinary books that aren't made to be playthings (such as vinyl bathtub books) and that don't have baubles or other materials on their covers have always been exempt from regulations on lead in paint. But the new regulations on lead in children's products do cover all kinds of books, according to a December 23 letter from the CPSC's office of general counsel to the Association of American Publishers. Librarians say there's no way they can verify the lead content of all the books on their children's department shelves. "The cost would be unbelievably high for them to test all these books so we could keep them in the library, and how long would we go without them if every library in New England sends them to the same lab," Donna Rasche, librarian at the Brewer, Maine, Public Library, told CNN affiliate WCSH-TV . Arkush is unmoved by such arguments. "If libraries can provide evidence that broad classes of books don't pose a risk of harm to the public health, then they can be granted an exemption from the testing requirements," he said. "If they can't prove that and if the books actually do pose a safety problem, then they shouldn't be sent home with kids." Publishers -- which will have to prove the safety of new books anyway -- and groups such as the American Library Association could foot the bill for testing older books, he said. "They don't have to test every book, obviously," Arkush said. "They don't even have to test anywhere near every title. I think they really have to test a reasonable sample size of different classes of books -- different types of binding, different types of materials used." A coalition of consumer advocacy groups continues to support the law but issued a statement Friday that criticized the CPSC's implementation of it. "While we have urged the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promptly address reasonable concerns that have been raised regarding compliance, and provide better information about the new law, our organizations all agree that the law is fundamentally sound and essential to ensuring a safer marketplace," the statement read. It was signed by Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, Union of Concerned Scientists, Kids in Danger, U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Public Citizen. The commission earlier this month clarified the regulations to let resale and thrift shops off the hook for testing the used clothing and other items they sell. Those outlets still are expected to watch out for items that have been recalled or banned, the CPSC said.
The Justice Department is preparing to sue Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known internationally as "America's toughest sheriff," saying talks between the two sides have fallen through. The Obama administration and Arpaio's Maricopa County Sheriff's Office had been in the midst of settlement talks, after the Justice Department accused it of systematically discriminating against Latinos. As part of the settlement, the department wanted Arpaio to allow an independent monitor to oversee reforms at his office. The Justice Department called it a "key, non-negotiable requirement." The two sides were scheduled to meet Wednesday, but Arpaio called off the meeting at the last minute, the Justice Department said. "We believe that you are wasting time and not negotiating in good faith," said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roy Austin Jr. in a letter to Arpaio's legal counsel. It added: "MCSO's refusal to engage in good faith negotiations requires us to prepare for civil action." Arpaio shot back, saying he would not "surrender" his officer to the federal government. "Appointment of an outside monitor essentially usurps the powers and duties of an elected Sheriff and transfers them to a person or group of persons selected by the federal government," he said in a statement Tuesday. "And so to the Obama administration, who is attempting to strong arm me into submission only for its political gain, I say, 'This will not happen, not on my watch!'" A federal Department of Justice investigation into Arpaio's office made public in December described "a pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos at MCSO that reaches the highest levels of the agency." Arpaio dismissed the allegations as a politically-driven "witch hunt." He pointed out how President Barack Obama opposed Arizona's controversial anti-immigration law and how the president mentioned Arpaio as the person pushing the law, the sheriff said. "By the way, I don't want to say it's all politics, but everyone I'm talking about happens to be Democrats," said Arpaio, a Republican. Arpaio added: "Don't come to use me as a whipping boy for a national, international problem." The 22-page Justice Department letter alleged the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office committed federal and constitutional violations. Detention officers in Arpaio's jail invoked offensive slurs and profanities against Hispanics, calling them "wetbacks," "Mexican bitches," and "stupid Mexicans," the letter said. "Sheriff Arpaio's own actions have helped nurture MCSO's culture of bias," said the letter, written to the Maricopa County attorney. For example, the sheriff apparently endorsed one constituent's letter asking for a "round-up" at one Phoenix street corner of "dark-skin(ned)" people: Arpaio told a member of his command staff in a note to "(h)ave someone handle this," the Justice Department said. Jack MacIntyre, Arpaio's deputy chief, described the Justice Department's allegations as "a sneak attack by the federal government on the citizens of Arizona." The Justice Department also said it is reviewing allegations that the sheriff's office did not investigate " a large number of sex crimes. " The sheriff's office has acknowledged to federal authorities that 432 cases of sexual assault and child molestation were not properly investigated over a three-year period ending in 2007, and many of the victims apparently were Latinos, the Justice Department said. The federal findings also alleged discriminatory policing practices by Arpaio's officers including "unlawful stops, detentions and arrests of Latinos," according to a Justice Department statement. It also noted that the sheriff's office has discriminated against "Latino inmates with limited English by punishing them and denying critical services." It further blamed the office for allowing "specialized units to engage in unconstitutional practices" and for a lack of oversight and deputy training. The initial federal inquiry began in June 2008 and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents and more than 400 interviews, including current and former inmates as well as office personnel. Authorities notified the sheriff's office of a formal investigation a year later, a statement said. Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez said the sheriff's office initially failed to cooperate with investigators, prompting federal authorities to take the "virtually unprecedented step" of filing a lawsuit in 2010. He noted the investigation had uncovered startling levels of racial profiling against Latino drivers, ranging between four and nine times higher than against non-Latino motorists. Perez added that an independent reviewer involved in the probe described it as "the most egregious racial profiling in the United States" he had ever seen.
Pop superstar Whitney Houston was seen ordering and consuming considerable quantities of alcohol at The Beverly Hilton two mornings last week, said a source briefed on her behavior and activity in the days before her death Saturday. The source told CNN's Don Lemon that Houston ordered the drinks before 10 a.m. last Wednesday and Thursday from the bars in the lobby and pool area. Guests both days overheard Houston loudly complaining about her drinks, accusing bartenders of "watering down" or "putting too much ice" in them, the source said Wednesday. Houston's funeral will be broadcast Saturday The source said other guests expressed concern about Houston's erratic behavior. Her disheveled appearance, including mismatched clothing, suggested to them that she was intoxicated, the source said. The source said Houston was seen jumping in and out of the pool and doing somersaults in the pool area. The source added that Houston was alone for some of the time, but was also seen at the pool drinking with her entourage and a male companion on both days. Saturday, the day she died, Houston was seen drinking at the pool in the morning, although the source noted witnesses said her behavior did not appear erratic. A singer who participated in an impromptu duet with Houston at a party Thursday night said Houston was not behaving erratically, but did have champagne. "I didn't see someone who was high," Kelly Price told CNN's "Starting Point" on Monday. During the party, Houston took the stage unexpectedly and sang a hoarse rendition of "Jesus Loves Me" with Price. Authorities are trying to determine the source of Houston's prescription medication found in the hotel room where she died, officials said Wednesday. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office has issued subpoenas seeking Houston's medical records and her prescriptions, Ed Winter, assistant chief coroner, said Wednesday. Investigators are also contacting pharmacies where the prescriptions were filled, he said. Houston, 48, was found dead in the bathtub of her suite at the Beverly Hilton on Saturday, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash at the Beverly Hills, California, hotel. Houston's death certificate, filed Wednesday, listed her cause of death as "deferred," meaning it was delayed pending more information. Speculation has grown while authorities await the outcome of toxicology tests that could take weeks. See PDF file of the death certificate Winter has said that while medication was found in the room, the amount was less than that usually present in overdose deaths. "I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in," Winter said earlier. He ruled out foul play and said there were no injuries to Houston's body. The prescriptions found in the room were in Houston's name, Winter told Lemon. By contacting the doctors, investigators are attempting to verify the prescriptions and find out if there were any more. Several doctors have been contacted in California and other states, along with pharmacies, he said. All were cooperating. "The doctors I've contacted so far have been helpful," he said, and nothing out of the ordinary was found as long as Houston was taking the medication as prescribed. Some additional information has been gained, he said, and investigators are waiting to see Houston's medical records. It does not appear that she was "doctor shopping," he said, but officials are attempting to contact as many doctors as possible to rule that out, along with determining whether Houston was filling multiple prescriptions. "Everything is above board," Winter said. "So far, nothing looks criminal." But it was too soon to say whether Houston had any prescriptions she should not have or used an alias, he said. Although subpoenas have been issued -- a fairly unusual step in a death investigation -- Winter said the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has not been asked to assist. As part of the investigation following the death of singer Michael Jackson in 2009, bags and bottles of prescription drugs were found at Jackson's home. Local and state authorities spent months tracking the pharmacies that filled the prescriptions. One of those pharmacies was the Mickey Fine Pharmacy and Grill in Beverly Hills. One of the prescriptions found in Houston's suite was also from the Mickey Fine pharmacy, Winter said, but "the prescription that came from Mickey Fine is not something that would kill her." Investigators want a history of all prescriptions Houston may have filled there and at other pharmacies, and wants to make sure all of the pharmacies that filled Houston's prescriptions are accounted for. Generally, "you go to a doctor and get a prescription, then you go to the dentist and get another prescription," he said. Houston visited a Beverly Hills ear, nose and throat specialist four days before she died, a source familiar with her visit said Wednesday. Dr. Shawn Nasseri has treated Houston for throat and vocal problems for several years, said the source, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Nasseri treats many well-known singers who have vocal problems, and has served as the doctor for "American Idol" contestants for several years. Houston's battles with drug addiction had cast a shadow in recent years over her impressive singing voice and her talent. However, a close family friend told CNN on Tuesday that Houston had not used "hard drugs" for several years, although she was taking medication for a throat infection and Xanax or a similar drug for anxiety and to help her sleep. The friend said Houston was also known to have a drink if she went out. The coroner's office said toxicology tests could take six to eight weeks, though Beverly Hills police Lt. Mark Rosen said that the coroner's report is expected to be finished sooner -- in two to three weeks. Winter said Wednesday his office has asked that Houston's toxicology results be expedited, saying he's hoping for a tournaround of four to six weeks, possibly sooner. "With respect to Ms. Houston, we have an average of 50 cases a day," he said. "We've got 49 other cases and families looking for results too." A private, invitation-only funeral is planned for Houston on Saturday at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, where she honed her vocal skills as a child. The services are expected to be made available for television and web streaming, Houston's publicist said. Singer Aretha Franklin, Houston's godmother who is known as the "Queen of Soul," has been asked to perform at the funeral service, Franklin's spokeswoman said. And Houston's cousin, singer Dionne Warwick, was in New Jersey helping the family with funeral arrangements, Warwick's publicist said. Gospel singer and pastor Marvin L. Winans will give the eulogy at the funeral at the request of Houston's mother, said New Hope Pastor Joe Carter. Winans officiated Houston's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, said Carter. The two divorced in 2007. Asked why no public memorial service was planned, Winans told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night the family didn't "want to have a parade." "I don't think, knowing Cissy (Houston's mother) and the Houston family ... it was a matter of public or private as it was this is my daughter, this is my sister, this is my mother, this is my friend and we want to do this with dignity." Although the family is not commenting on Houston's burial location, her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey. A message left by CNN with the cemetery office was not immediately returned. Meanwhile, Bobby Brown said in a statement Wednesday his 18-year-old daughter with Houston, Bobbi Kristina, is "doing much better." The teenager was twice taken to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to be treated for stress and anxiety in the day following her mother's death. A close family friend said Tuesday that Bobbi Kristina was in the care of her grandmother, Cissy Houston, and her father. "We continue to provide love and support to Bobbi Kristina," Bobby Brown's statement said Wednesday. "She is dealing with the tragedy of her mother's death and would prefer to do it outside of the public eye. I ask again that our privacy be respected." CNN's Stan Wilson, Alan Duke, Denise Quan and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report.
Michael Jackson's "live" performance at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards brought a mixed reaction Sunday night. "Uncomfortable, odd and eerily interesting," is how public relations agent Simone Smalls summed it up in a tweet. "Not quite sure what to feel. #MissingMJ" Uncomfortable because Jackson died nearly five years ago while preparing for a comeback tour. His remains are resting in a crypt in a Forest Lawn mausoleum. But technology tricked viewers -- and the celebrity audience in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas -- into suspending disbelief for a few minutes to watch the pop icon onstage dancing and singing his "new" song "Slave to the Rhythm." Ludacris, the rapper-actor who hosted the show, actually introduced it as "Live from the MGM Grand, Michael Jackson." "He's baaaccck!" Mark Cuban, the owner of an NBA team and TV channel, tweeted about Jackson's "hologram." Cuban added an Instagram video. The dance moves were not really Michael Jackson's but apparently those of a stand-in performer who recreated his steps for a computer that then laid on an image intended to replicate Jackson. But where was the swagger -- like Charlie Chaplin -- that characterized Jackson's cool walk? "I wish it would have actually looked like him," one fan said. It was eerily interesting because the illusion was effective if you didn't watch too closely or weren't obsessively familiar with Jackson's dancing, walking and appearance. "I enjoyed it. Could have had better face but overall it was great. Will have it on repeat," a diehard Jackson fan tweeted. #kendallyouhadonejob Imagine Ed Sullivan confusing the Beatles with the Beach Boys when he introduced the British group's first live U.S. television performance 50 years ago. That's the modern equivalent of what Kendall Jenner did at the Billboard Awards. The reality TV personality, model and Kardashian half-sister caught herself halfway through introducing the Australian boy band 5 Seconds of Summer as One Direction. "Now, we welcome One... Guys, I'm the worst reader!" Jenner said as she dived below the camera shot. She quickly tossed to a video of the group -- which included a short clip comparing their arrival in the United States to the Beatles' 1964 invasion. Jenner never fully recovered. The television audience only heard her say "of Summer" when she resumed the intro after the video. Twitter had a blast with the 18-year-old's flub. Two hashtags soon trended: #kendallyouhadonejob and #KendalljennerItsFIVE But many -- including Jenner herself -- agreed on one thing. Kendall Jenner looked great on the red carpet. Lorde's message Lorde wants you to know she's no longer the young 15-year-old who recorded "Royals," a song that spent much of last summer at the top of the charts and was honored Sunday as the "top rock song." "What I wanted to say was that I am 17 and a half now," Lorde said as she accepted Billboard's top new artist award. When laughter erupted with that remark, she stopped to say "that wasn't a joke." Lorde's said she's had "the opportunity to grow and learn as a new artist" in the last year "in the spotlight." She later performed "Tennis Court," another song from her younger years. The irony not lost on the Billboard audience is that many people are surprised to learn that the mature talking-acting-looking New Zealander is actually a teenager. #Lordeis17 became a trending topic on Twitter worldwide.

In 2003, the BET Awards had a priceless moment when Michael Jackson surprised his idol, James Brown, by showing up on stage where the duo thrilled the audience with an electrifying performance. Michael Jackson performed with James Brown at the BET Awards in 2003. This year's show is dedicated to Jackson. Now, both the King of Pop and the Godfather of Soul are gone. Sunday night's 9th Annual BET Awards is sure to be filled with tributes to Jackson, whose videos and performances were a staple for the network in his heyday. BET has already paid tribute to the singer, going wall-to-wall with Jackson videos Thursday night. Many of the celebrities scheduled to attend the show were also fans of the singer and it is expected that the night will provide an opportunity for them to salute the star. "Words cannot capture the impact Michael Jackson has had on pop culture around the world," said Debra L. Lee, chairman and chief executive officer of BET Networks. "He changed the way we hear and feel and move to music; he epitomized what true musical talent and star power really mean. He is and always will be the King of Pop." Academy Award-winning actor and R&B singer Jamie Foxx is set to host the show. Several of the scheduled performers include artists, such as Ne-Yo and Beyonce, who have acknowledged the influence of Jackson on their music and careers. The annual event is a premier one for the network and this year's plan was to recognize the musical legacy and longstanding career of the legendary soul trio, the O'Jays, with the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award. Artists Alicia Keys and Wyclef Jean are to be honored with the Humanitarian Award for their respective charitable work. BET CEO Lee said Sunday's show will be dedicated to Jackson and will also pay tribute to his legacy. Lee reflected on Jackson's career and his importance to BET -- which stands for Black Entertainment Television -- in a prepared statement after his death, while also offering heartfelt prayers for the singer's family and friends. "Michael's influence is felt every day in so many ways at BET Networks, and it's been that way throughout our network's entire 29-year history," she said. "We watched him grow up and, like everyone around the world, he feels like he is a member of our family. "He will be missed more than we can say ... but his legend and memory live on in the artists, musicians, producers, dancers, fans and everyone else who looks to him for inspiration." The BET Awards is scheduled to run live on the cable network Sunday at 8 p.m.
Lionel Messi's sixth hat-trick of 2010 helped Barcelona demolish Almeria 8-0 on Saturday night, but three goals from Cristiano Ronaldo kept Real Madrid on top in Spain ahead of next Monday's "Clasico" clash between the La Liga giants. Messi reached the milestone of 100 league goals for Barcelona in just 154 appearances for the defending champions, and has already scored 22 this season in all competitions. His third goal briefly lifted him above Ronaldo as the league's top scorer on 13, putting the visitors seven up before the Argentine laid on substitute Bojan Krkic's second goal with 17 minutes to play. Barcelona led 5-0 at the halftime break, with Messi breaking the deadlock in the 17th minute after combining well with David Villa. Andres Iniesta made it 2-0 a minute later after woeful defending by Almeria, with his misplaced cross fortuitously rebounding back into his path, then Peru defender Wilmer Acasiete turned Maxwell's low cross into his own net on 27. Pedro embarrassed the onrushing Diego Alves eight minutes later as he easily won the race to a long ball in the 35th minute, then soon after Messi netted from the winger's low cross at the second attempt after the goalkeeper parried his first. Messi helped set up Bojan's first in the 62nd minute, with the 20-year-old showing nimble feet before dinking the ball over Alves. The beleaguered Alves could only parry Villa's shot into Messi's pass for the seventh, and Bojan made no mistake when sent free down the middle to seal the biggest win of the Spanish season so far and leave Almeria in the bottom three. The home side had conceded only 10 goals in 11 games -- the third best defensive record in the league behind Real and Barcelona -- but coach Juan Manuel Lillo was sacked after the match. Barcelona travel to Greece on Wednesday to face Panathinaikos in the Champions League, then host Real in a Monday fixture forced due to security concerns over the Catalan elections that weekend. Real Madrid will take a one-point lead into that match following the 5-1 victory at home to Athletic Bilbao in the late match, as coach Jose Mourinho completed his two-match touchline ban. With the Portuguese boss watching from various positions in the stands, Real almost went behind in just the second minute when defender Pepe had to clear off the line from Fernando Llorente. But Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead in the 19th minute with a clinical low finish after fellow Argentine Angel Di Maria slipped a low pass into the penalty area, and Ronaldo doubled the lead on the half-hour after Mesut Ozil cleverly knocked the ball into his path. Spain striker Llorente reduced the deficit five minutes before halftime from close range with his ninth league goal of the season, but Real restored their two-goal buffer 11 minutes after the break. Di Maria duped Markel Susaeta into bringing him down just inside the box, and defender Sergio Ramos surprisingly stepped up to smash home the resulting penalty for his first goal of the campaign. Ronaldo effectively sealed the win in the 62nd minute with a swerving free-kick that wrongfooted goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz could only palm into his net. The Portugal forward then netted his 15th league goal this season -- and 17th overall -- from the penalty spot in time added on after substitute Esteban Granero was brought down, despite having to retake the kick after illegally stopping in his initial run-up. Bilbao, who hit the bar through Javi Martinez in the 87th minute, were left in ninth place -- 16 points behind Real. Villarreal retained third place after coming from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Valencia, who stayed fourth. Aritz Aduriz put Valencia ahead in the 20th minute with a deflected shot as Villarreal -- who had won all five previous home matches this season -- conceded at El Madrigal for just the second time. Italy forward Giuseppe Rossi gave his side a lifeline in the 73rd minute with a volley for his eighth La Liga goal of the campaign as his team now trail Real by eight points. Valencia lost Lithuania defender Marius Stankevicius to a second yellow card with 10 minutes to go, but held on for the draw ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Turkish side Bursaspor.
The Cannes Film festival, which kicked off Wednesday on the French Riviera, is an Olympics of cinema, where endurance matters as much as victory to the 30,000 industry insiders who attend each year. The festival was conceived in the late 1930s as a reaction against Italian dictator Benito Mussolini promoting fascist-Italian and national-socialist German films at the Venice Film Festival. Its first edition, planned in September 1939, was delayed by war till 1946 but its ideals remained the same: to show films from all over the world without prejudice of any sort. But today Cannes jostles in the crowded film industry schedules with other A-list events: Toronto (and Venice) act as Fall launchpads for the following year's awards season, while Sundance is at the vanguard of independent cinema and new talent. Meanwhile the Oscars are considered by many as the supreme accolade of the movie business. Cannes still regards itself as the grande dame of film events the world over -- but does it still matter? The festival, which this year celebrates its 67th edition, stands firmly apart -- and, some would argue, above -- the rest of the crowd. This comes in part from its original ambition, as put by the festival's first president, poet Jean Cocteau: "The Cannes Film Festival is an apolitical no man's land, a microcosm of what the world would be like if people could make direct contact with one another and speak the same language." For Cannes is to cinema what the motto "liberte, egalite, fraternite" ("liberty, egality, fraternity") is to France: an aspiration, an ideal, an inclusive forum for all talents, old and new, coming from all over the world, and motivated by one common love: films. Without prejudices. In its early years Cannes was nothing more than a social event where stars mingled on the red carpet. Everyone smiled for the camera and everyone went home happy as almost every film received some kind of an award. Then, Cannes raised its game. First came the Palme d'Or, its top award, given in 1955 and rivaling the Oscars as the most prestigious prize in the film industry. In 1972, the festival declared its independence by setting up its own selection committee: until then, each country had chosen the films which would represent them at Cannes, as still happens with the Oscars' best foreign film category. The selection of features became more discerning, the awards became fewer in number -- and success at the festival became ever more elusive. But if the Cannes glamor of the 1950s and 1960s lingers still, the festival's reputation for passion and controversy has only increased. The entertainment industry is notorious for controlling its sometimes unruly talents, with PR agencies operating like war machines and publicity a matter of life and death at the box office. In contrast Cannes is a unique place for unleashing imagination and wildness. The mix of glamor and high art, frivolity and seriousness combine to make Cannes a temple to cinema like no other. For Cannes is where directors will throw tantrums and tell critics to go to hell in no uncertain terms; where the winner of the Palme d'Or can be booed, as happened to film-maker Maurice Pialat in 1987 when he collected the coveted prize for "Under the Sun;" and where a talent like Danish maverick Lars Von Trier can express sympathy at a press conference for Adolf Hitler, then apologize, then be kicked out of the festival by the organizers (he later withdrew his apology). It is also an event which has always embraced the times. In 1968, while students in Paris were rioting and building barricades, the enfants terribles of the French New Wave -- including François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard -- canceled the awards ceremony and turned the festival into a giant marketplace. In 2004, Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" -- which criticized U.S. foreign policy -- became the first documentary to win the Palme d'Or from a festival jury which numbered more Americans than French. For directors and actors, success at Cannes is the Nobel Prize that they secretly covet. And for the 2,500 or so film critics -- who for 12 days start watching their first film at 8am and their last one just after midnight -- it is the most frantic and rewarding time, when masterpieces are seen for the first time and talents speak freely.

Two Amish girls, who were apparently abducted from a roadside farm stand in upstate New York, have been found and are safe, authorities said early Friday. An Amber Alert was issued late Wednesday in Oswegatchie for Delila Miller, 6, and her sister, Fannie, 12. They had been selling vegetables near their family farm, located about 50 miles southeast of the Canadian border. A witness told police the girls were tending to a customer who drove up in a white 4-door sedan and disappeared when the vehicle pulled away, according to the Amber Alert. Rhonda Wells, senior dispatcher for St. Lawrence County Sheriff, told CNN early Friday that the girls had been located and were safe. She declined to provide further details, saying a press release will be issued later Friday. The Amber Alert has been canceled. St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells had said Thursday at a news conference that multiple agencies were investigating leads called in by the public. Pictures of the girls were not available because members of the Amish community forbid photos of themselves, which they see as a violation of their religious beliefs. "I wouldn't say it's hindering the investigation, it's just that it would be helpful" to have photos, Wells said. "In the Amish world, photos aren't going to be available." He said the Amish community "is always cooperative with us and forthcoming," Police late Thursday released a sketch of the older girl, Fannie, to help in the search. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.
Heisman Trophy hopeful Jameis Winston did not have consensual sex with a student at Florida State University, despite claims to the contrary by the football player's lawyer, the family of the accuser said Friday. "To be clear, the victim did not consent. This was rape," according to a statement released by the accuser's family. The release of the statement came a day after Winston's attorney, Tim Jansen, told reporters the sex was consensual and that his client's DNA was found on the clothing of the woman, who nearly a year ago said she was raped. ESPN, which first reported the DNA development, said the Florida crime lab determined that the possibility it was someone else's DNA would be one in 2.2 trillion. The case began in December when the woman, a student at the Tallahassee university, reported she had been sexually assaulted. A month later she accused Winston of the alleged rape. Prosecutor to 'get to the bottom' of sex assault case The story became public when some media outlets put in public records requests for the alleged victim's complaint. Tallahassee police have released a heavily redacted incident report documenting a sexual assault allegation in early December 2012. Tallahassee Police Department Interim Chief Tom Coe told reporters this week that the accuser "broke off contact" with them in February and didn't want to go forward with the case. The family of the woman has blasted the police investigation. The woman's family has said a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a "big football town" and her life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Jansen, Winston's attorney, said he believed the case was closed months ago. But Coe has said the case is still open. No one has been charged in the investigation, and state attorney Willie Meggs said his office has yet to interview the woman. He will meet with his staff Friday, he said, to determine their next steps. The family of the accuser has said they never leaked information about the case, a response to Jansen's comment last week that the timing of the media discovering the case -- in the middle of the college football season -- was "very suspect." The Heisman Trophy is awarded each December to the player who voters believe is college football's top player for the season. Winston has thrown for 28 touchdowns for the Seminoles, who are 10-0 and with three more wins could play in January for the national championship. Winston didn't play during the 2012 season but came to Florida State as one of the nation's top quarterback recruits, according to recruiting rankings. Florida State has said university officials cannot comment on an open investigation. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.
For three years, the thieves crept into some of the poshest homes in the most exclusive enclaves in the nation. The gated community of Bel Air was one  of several enclaves targeted by the so-called "Hillside Burglars." Police said they finally have a break in the case, and wealthy residents of Los Angeles, California, are breathing a sigh of relief. "These guys were real good," said L.A. City Councilman Jack Weiss, who oversees Bel Air where some of the burglaries were committed. "They were professionals." The thieves hauled away more than $10 million worth of valuables and cash from 150 homes in upscale neighborhoods such as Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Beverly Hills, police said. Homes of Hollywood celebrities, professional athletes and multimillionaires were hit. According to CNN affiliate KABC, country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw and former Paramount Pictures CEO Sherry Lansing were among the victims. DNA evidence led the LAPD to suspected ringleader Troy Corsby Thomas, 45, of Los Angeles. He was arrested near L.A. International Airport last weekend. Police say Thomas led a gang dubbed the "Hillside Burglars" that targeted the neighborhoods overlooking Sunset Boulevard. "It's a very euphoric, satisfying feeling that we got this person," said the police Lt. David McGill. "It's a very frustrating feeling to tell the victims, 'I'm sorry I don't have any news for you.' Finally when we got some good detective work and breaks, things started lining up." Police are looking for more suspects linked to the three-year spree but are not naming them. Thomas is being held on $2 million bail, according to the L.A. County District Attorney's Office. He is likely to stay in custody because he must reveal the origin of any funds used to pay the bail, authorities said. At a court appearance Tuesday, Thomas pleaded not guilty to two charges of residential burglary, one in January 2006 and another in March 2008. The preliminary court date for Thomas will be set on January 29 and additional charges are expected to be filed, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Police will not comment on Thomas' background. The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas told police he had been working as an auto broker. The Hillside Burglars have not struck since Thomas' arrest, police said. "Hallelujah!" said L.A. Councilman Bill Rosendahl, whose district includes Brentwood and Pacific Palisades. "Even a crafty crook does make his mistake and that's what happened to this one." Some residents are cautiously optimistic. "We're delighted," said Robert René, president of Brentwood Homeowners Association, which represents about 800 homes. "We are very fortunate to have the due diligence of the Westside LAPD." Harvey I. Saferstein, president of the Bel Air Association, agreed, "We are all obviously thankful and relieved." The financially strapped LAPD created a Hillside Burglars task force. People donated cameras and other equipment and police stepped up patrols. The outlay amounted to "millions of dollars," Rosendahl said. Neighborhood watch groups formed. One in Bel Air donated $8,000 for infrared cameras that can spot burglars in the dark. Robert Ringler, president of the Bel Air Beverly Crest Neighborhood Council, hosted a community meeting with the LAPD at the five-star Bel Air Hotel a year and a half ago. As swans swam in ponds in the background, about 150 Westside residents sipped Perrier and vented their fears. "It had gotten to be such an epidemic," Ringler said. The impressive mansions -- usually gated and hidden by walls and hedges -- dot the lush hillsides and canyons between the coast and the mountains. The qualities that make them so desirable also make them vulnerable. The seclusion that appeals to upscale homeowners also appeals to thieves. Because many of the homes are tucked into the sides of mountains and canyons, behind gates, it's easy for a thief to escape unseen and hard for police to get there quickly. "It's the perfect target," Ringler said. "You can access the property and nobody would ever see you." Frequently, maids, pool workers and gardeners have access to the property, which allows burglars to pass as the help and slip in unchallenged. According to police and media reports, the methods were sophisticated. Burglars waited till homeowners went on vacation or out for the night. They used lawn furniture and ladders to creep into the second floor, which often lacked alarms. They quickly went in, looked for jewelry, safes and cash, and ducked out with the goods. They never attacked any of the homeowners, preferring stealth to confrontation. Residents say they learned to keep jewelry and other valuables in safety deposit boxes and out of sight. Many added alarm systems and insured their belongings. "It's not just about money," said Robin Stevens, who lives with her husband and son in Brentwood. "A lot of people lost things of sentimental value." Stevens, whose neighbors have been burglarized,  said she feels safer knowing that police arrested Thomas, but will continue hiding her mother's antique jewelry and locking the windows. During a two-week trip to the South Pacific last fall, Stevens made sure to e-mail her neighbors, notifying them that she would be gone so they could look out for strangers. Other residents remain skeptical. Pacific Palisades Community Council Chairman Richard G. Cohen said he feels relief but is waiting for a conviction. "The arrest doesn't mark the end of our concern," he said. With the economy in a tailspin, Steve Twining, who serves on the West Los Angeles Police advisory board, believes thefts will continue. "In these dire economic times, I don't think it's going to dissuade others from trying to do the same thing," he said. "The burglary situation will probably get worse before it gets better."
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is in India on his first foreign trip since assuming the post and has begun diplomatic talks at a delicate time for the world's two most populous nations. Just weeks ago, the world witnessed the latest chapter in one of Asia's least understood disputes when soldiers from China's People's Liberation Army crossed the border and set up an encampment in the mountains at the edge of the Indian region of Ladakh. The troops have since withdrawn, but the incident served as a stark reminder of the smoldering problem that still bedevils the Asian behemoths. The origins of the struggle for this charged corner of the world lies in the realpolitik and imperialism of the 19th and 20th centuries. According to a report by the U.S. Marine Corps Command and Staff College, the British, installed in their Indian colony, attempted to demarcate their holdings with the "Johnson Line." CNN iReport: Indians protest China's incursion Drawn by the surveyor, William Johnson in 1864, it claimed the area known as Aksai Chin as part of India's Ladakh territory. The British later repudiated the line and, in 1899, replaced it with the Macartney-MacDonald line. The new line moved Aksai Chin back to China. After World War I, the British reversed themselves again, placing Aksai Chin back in India, but never made any effort to exert formal authority. In 1947, newly independent India drew their border to reflect the more generous Johnson Line even though they had not exerted an iota of control over Aksai Chin for almost half a century. The Ladakh incursion puts a wrinkle on what seemed to be a burgeoning era of Sino-Indian bonhomie. In recent years, both nations have bent over backwards to demonstrate their mutual good will. Bilateral trade is expected to hit $100 billion by 2015, joint military exercises were held last year (after previously being suspended) and both sides had agreed to respect a more favorable boundary for China known as the "Line of Actual Control." But China's recent advance beyond the de facto border is hardly without precedent. According to The Times of India, China has violated the LAC more than 500 times since 2010. Though experts have described many of these transgressions as "routine," and regular military contact exists between the two governments, any "mistake" that were to occur by the Chinese army on Indian soil could be volatile. Particularly in China, journalist-stoked jingoism can turn even the most banal activity into an absurd ballet of face-saving. Far-fetched? In 2002, American soldiers in South Korea accidentally ran over and killed two 14-year-old girls. The Yangju Highway Incident, as it became known, sparked a fury of anti-American protests and severely tested the U.S.-Korea relationship -- and America was there legally. How would India and China resolve a similar incident? "Mistakes can be made," said Anil Gupta, professor of strategy & globalization, at the University of Maryland at College Park and co-founder of the China-India Institute. "However, I do not believe that either China or India is looking for a fight." Gupta stressed that China's latest incursion should be seen in a regional context as a test of "muscle-flexing" and that its actions were not indicative of any real desire to acquire new territory. Muscle-flexing or not, what is certain is that in recent years China has become a very bad neighbor. Their Indian claims extend over a 6,530-kilometer (4,057-mile) border, which includes a sizeable chunk of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and large swaths of Bhutan. In the last year the world saw the strident revival of China's long dormant claim to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, as well as a string of others extending as far south as the James Shoal, a mere 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the Malaysian coast. While the risk of conflict between China and India will always remain until a final resolution is reached, going forward, there are reasons to believe that the two sides will be able to continue on a relatively peaceful track. China's relationship with India is far more benign than its one with their other regional antagonist, Japan. The 1962 Sino-Indian war, fought for this very territory, is all but forgotten among Chinese citizens, while memories of Japanese hostilities during World War II are as raw as ever. As the Sinologist Susan Shirk reported in her book: "China: Fragile Superpower," China's relationship with Japan is highly sensitive and thus subject to the counterproductive impulses of popular nationalism. By contrast, China's relations with India stir no such emotions and are handled out of the spotlight with greater room to maneuver. Economics too will likely promote cooler heads. As Gupta noted, India's importance to China will only increase as India's economy grows. As a market for exports and investments, he predicted that India would become an invaluable partner. "I see the next five years as high risk," said Gupta. "Then I think we can all be a lot more relaxed." Unfortunately, it remains a truism that facts on the ground often move faster than governments' ability to respond to them. In the absence of a resolution, the world can only hope that India and China succeed in kicking their differences down the road indefinitely, because if their dispute ever does come to a head, the consequences could be catastrophic.

(CNN)Can anything stop Pep Guardiola's irresistible Bavarian machine? It doesn't look likely on this form. Five separate players scored as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich thrashed a woeful Hamburg 8-0 at the Allianz Arena Saturday. Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze, Arjen Robben, Robert Lewandowski and Franck Ribery did the damage with Muller, Gotze and Robben each scoring twice. Bayern returns to Champions League action on Tuesday night against Shaktar Donetsk of the Ukraine but refused to rest up against its struggling northern opponents despite being three goals up at half time. The reigning German champions rolled in a further five goals after the break, maintaining its eight point lead atop the table over second placed Wolfsburg who were involved in a high scoring affair of an entirely different nature Saturday. A 93-minute goal from Bas Dost ensured Die Wolfe claimed a dramatic 5-4 victory over sixth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The late strike was the Dutchman's fourth goal of a pulsating game in which Wolfsburg had led 3-0 at half time before being pegged back at 4-4 in the closing stages. Leverkusen's Heung-Min Sun also grabbed a hat-trick although the Korean's star-showing was somewhat overshadowed by Dost's match-winning heroics. In Saturday's other Bundesliga fixtures, Borussia Dortmund's mini-revival continued with a 4-2 victory at home to Mainz. The result lifts Jurgen Klopp's men up to 16th position and clear of the relegation and playoff places where it has found itself in recent weeks. There was no such joy for VFB Stuttgart, however, which remains rooted to the foot of the table after going down 2-1 to HGV Hoffenheim. Elsewhere, an injry-time header from Borussia Moenchengladbach's Granit Xhaka sealed a 1-0 win over regional rivals Cologne. However, the goal sparked scenes of anger among a group of Cologne fans dressed all in white who invaded the pitch and briefly clashed with police before order was restored.
All 77 NATO service members wounded in a Saturday attack against a coalition base in Afghanistan are U.S. troops, a spokeswoman for the International Security Assistance Force said Sunday. Two Afghan civilians were killed and 25 others also were wounded in the attack, which occurred on the eve of the 10th anniversary of al Qaeda's attack on the United States on 9/11, U.S. Army Sgt. Lindsey Kibler said. None of the injuries is life-threatening, ISAF said, and those wounded are expected to return to duties "shortly." The truck bombing took place in the central-east province of Wardak, and those killed were Afghan laborers, said Shahidullah Shahid, the Wardak governor's spokesman. "This attack was a high-profile attack. It was a pretty significant suicide vehicle bomb," Gen. John R. Allen, commander of coalition and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux Sunday. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault. NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack was carried out by a Taliban suicide bomber. Allen said the attack indicates "much more what the Taliban are unable to do" than what they are able to do. "They have been ejected from the population in so many places around the country that their only ability to influence the battlefield on many occasions is simply to go for a high-profile attack. And that's how we view this particular attack," he said. Shahid said three people had died, while NATO said two. NATO also said 77 of its personnel were injured, while the provincial government said only 10 people were injured. It is not uncommon for a local government and NATO to have varying accounts of an attack. The attacker was driving a truck carrying firewood and detonated his explosives at an entry point to the base, ISAF said in a statement. "Most of the force of the explosion was absorbed by the protective barrier at the outpost entrance and though there were a significant number of injuries ... none is immediately life threatening," the statement said. In a video issued by ISAF on Saturday, Allen spoke about the 9/11 anniversary and the long war, saying that while "there is still much work to be done" in the fight against Taliban militants, "we will prevail." He also praised the troops from the 49 nations serving in the ISAF coalition. The protracted war began just a month after the al Qaeda terror network, sheltered at the time by the ruling Taliban militants, attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. U.S.-led forces kicked off Operation Enduring Freedom in October and ousted the Taliban. Coalition and Afghan troops have been fighting the tenacious Taliban militants in the Afghan-Pakistani region. Allen noted that "September 11 marks the 10th anniversary of an event that changed the world." Ever since that day, he said, the troops have crippled insurgents and have honored the victims of terrorism worldwide. He said the coalition is committed to making sure Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for al Qaeda. "You have helped the Afghan people build their nation, a democratic government and an ever-strengthening security force," he said, saying Afghanistan has made advances in security, economic development and governance. The coalition death toll in the war is nearing 2,700, according to a CNN count, with the United States sustaining most of the casualties in Operation Enduring Freedom. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began. Seventy-one American troops died in August, topping July 2010, when 65 troops died, according to the CNN tally. The surge in U.S. deaths comes as NATO is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

President Obama denied an accusation on Sunday that he had misled voters about his signature health care law in order to get it passed in 2010. "We had a yearlong debate. I mean, go back and look at your stories," Obama told reporters at the G20 summit in Australia Sunday. "The one thing we can't say is that, 'we did not have a lengthy debate about health care in the United states of America' or that it was not adequately covered." "The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run," Obama said. The comments the President referred to were made by Jim Gruber, an MIT health care economist, who noted in a 2010 speech that he "helped write the federal bill" and "was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well." In a series of speeches that have recently regained attention, Gruber says that engineers of the law, including the administration, took advantage of voters' "stupidity" in order to get the measure to pass. "Lack of transparency is a huge advantage," Gruber said in a panel discussion at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. "And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass." "(I wish) we could make it all transparent. But I'd rather have this law than not," he said. In another video, Gruber calls the strategy an "exploitation" of the American voter. "It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter," Gruber said at the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island. Obama vehemently denied Sunday that his administration was anything but transparent regarding the creation of the law and the debate that surrounded its implementation. "I would just advise every press outlet here: Pull up every clip and every story. I think it's fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent. It was a tough debate," Obama said. "Now, there were folks who disagreed with some of these various positions. It was a tough debate," he added The latest video is the sixth of its kind to emerge of Gruber detailing the political process behind the creation of the Affordable Care Act. In the video, Gruber explains how 'mislabeling' the law helped the administration get rid of tax breaks. "It turns out politically it's really hard to get rid of," Gruber said at the Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research in Boston. "And the only way we could get rid of it was first by mislabeling it, calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans." On Friday, former White House press secretary Jay Carney told CNN's Jake Tapper that Gruber's remarks were generally "very harmful politically to the president." "This is not good," Carney said. "(He) speaks from the ivory tower with remarkable hubris about the American voter and by extension the American Congress." Carney and his former boss aren't the only Democrats distancing themselves from Gruber's remarks. On Friday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she didn't even know who Gruber was, despite having formerly cited him on her website when she was House majority leader. "I don't know who he (Gruber) is. He didn't help write our bill," Pelosi said at a press conference. "With all due respect ...  you have a person who wasn't writing bill our bill commenting on what was going on when we were writing our bill who has withdrawn some of statements that he made."
no ifs, ands or Photoshopped butts about it. That's the pledge the magazine's staff made in its latest edition, after a push led by a Maine 14-year-old to combat the practice of tweaking pictures and picking models whose appearance give teens an unrealistic perspective on what is beautiful. "We vow to ... never change girls' body or face shapes. (Never have, never will)," the magazine states as part of its "Body Peace Treaty" from its August edition, a copy of which CNN obtained Thursday. The treaty and accompanying note by editor-in-chief Ann Shoket promise that Seventeen will "celebrate every kind of beauty" and feature "real girls and models who are healthy," while vouching that the magazine always has done just that. But the more than 84,000 people who signed a Change.org petition, started by teenager Julia Bluhm, clearly believed Seventeen and other publications didn't always present the full, unvarnished truth. "Those 'pretty women' that we see in magazines are fake," the petition said, in requesting "one unaltered -- real -- photo spread per month." "They're often Photoshopped, air-brushed, edited to look thinner and to appear like they have perfect skin. A girl you see in a magazine probably looks a lot different in real life." Retouching photographs is nothing new -- especially in magazines and, increasingly, on the Internet. Adobe Photoshop and other digital image manipulation programs are widely employed by professionals and everyday users. The petition claims that disseminating such altered images to impressionable teens can pose a real danger, helping to spawn a culture that touts unrealistic beauty and contributes to eating disorders, extreme dieting, depression and more. On YouTube, teens ask the world: Am I ugly? "I know how it affects girls and ... my friends," Julia told CNN in May, shortly after meeting with Shoket and presenting the signatures to her. "We don't realize it sometimes when we're just looking at the magazine and having fun. It can lower self-esteem." But not all teenage girls think retouching photographs is a problem. Alexis Jones of Alpharetta, Georgia, said Thursday she'd worry that, if magazines portrayed young women who were overweight or had acne as being beautiful, some girls may think it's OK to live an unhealthy lifestyle. In fact, she feels making models' bodies thinner and their skin clearer can serve as positive motivation for people to take better care of themselves. "Some people use that ideal image as motivation to get fit, eat healthy and stuff, while some use it as a crutch," said the 18-year-old, a rising freshman at Georgia State University. "You just have to be strong-minded." In addition to going "more public" in its commitment, Seventeen states in its latest edition it is partnering with the National Eating Disorders Association and the Commission for Positive Images of Women and Girls. The magazine's treaty also vows it will "be totally upfront about what goes into our photo shoots" and it understands that, "regardless of clothing size, being healthy is about honoring your natural shape." "We vow to ... give you the confidence to walk into any room and own it. Say bye-bye to those nagging insecurities that you're not good enough or pretty enough." Even as she pushed another petition urging Teen Vogue to make a similar public pledge, Julia celebrated the proposals made by Seventeen. "'Seventeen' listened!" she said in an update of her online petition. "They're saying they won't use Photoshop to digitally alter their models! This is a huge victory, and I'm so unbelievably happy." The magazine said that it will continue make small changes to photos, like erasing a stray hair or changing background colors, even as it insists it still won't make big changes to a person's body or face. Yet by not taking any responsibility for having presented anything but "authentic" beauty in the past, the magazine "doesn't really address (the) criticism" from many that it hasn't always lived by those rules, said former model Jenna Sauers. "Seventeen essentially says that it's never had any issues with the way it's Photoshopped ... celebrities and models but that, just to be on the safe side, it will continue not altering the bodies of the people photographed," said Sauers, a contributor to the female-focused, commentary-driven online magazine Jezebel.com. "It seems like 84,000 people who signed that petition seem to be of the opinion that there were some issues." Sauers said photo-editing tools have "made it incredibly easy to alter all kinds of things about image including body shape, size, skin color, skin tone, to erase wrinkles. And sometimes the effects are downright creepy." The practice is widely used, and accepted, in the fashion and magazine industry -- such that many people now almost assume that most any image of a beautiful person is somehow doctored, Sauers told CNN. "We've gotten used to the idea over the past 10 years or so that every single image we see in a magazine, particularly in women's magazines, is going to be an altered, hyper-real, impossible idealized version of how that person actually looks," she said. Empowering young girls online "For young girls, that's not a healthy visual culture to be growing up in." New York-based celebrity publicist Marvet Britto said on HLN's "Evening Express" that magazine editors generally are "not selling reality, they're selling where the consumer desires to be." "As much as we would like to think that (media would show) a more diverse array of the American public to young girls, that's simply not going to happen," Britto said, asserting you'll find "pretty much the same type of individual" on covers of magazines such as Seventeen. Emma Stydahar -- a teen activist affiliated with Spark, a movement devoted to ending "the sexualization of women and girls in media" for whom Bluhm has blogged -- acknowledged on HLN that altered images are widespread and do negatively affect girls. Still, she expressed excitement about Seventeen's new public declaration and anticipation that it will spur other publishers to follow suit. And if it doesn't, she promised, young women such as she and Julia Bluhme will keep pushing to affect change. "I definitely see that in the future," Stydahar said. "I know that, myself personally and my co-workers at Spark will not change until this capitalization off of young woman's body image stops."

With Quentin Tarantino's recent disclosure that Brad Pitt "pulled out a brick of hash" for the pair to smoke during a meeting about Tarantino's new film "Inglourious Basterds," the two movie icons could today be mistaken for old roomies. Brad Pitt and Quentin Tarantino have always wanted to work together but couldn't find the right project before "Inglourious Basterds." However, in an interview with CNN, the charismatic director of "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" insists that the well-anticipated union was a long time in the making. "It was very much a case of us wanting to work together, but waiting for the right project to come along," he told CNN. It has been 16 years since a youthful Pitt featured -- rather fittingly, it seems -- as a stoned layabout in "True Romance," the Tarantino-scripted tale of lovers on the run. Since that time, Tarantino says, "everybody's been wondering when this great love affair is gonna happen." And yet, when Tarantino first approached Brad's representative about another project, the agent was apparently "too protective" of the future relationship between the director and his client. "He told me the last thing he wanted was to put us in the same room and let us fall in love over a movie we wouldn't be able to do." A seasoned filmmaker by this time, Tarantino could relate to the points raised by the agent and decided to take a step back and let things happen naturally. He first sensed Pitt could be a strong contender for the role of Aldo Raine, the "fast-talking, vengeance-driven hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee" who leads Tarantino's critically-divisive "Inglourious Basterds," when he was half way through writing the script.  From "Dogs" to "Basterds:" Tarantino's career in pictures » At this stage, however, Tarantino was still not entirely convinced Pitt would be the best choice. "Then, I wrote a little bit more and thought Brad would be terrific. By the time I got towards the end, I felt he would be perfect but became worried I wouldn't get him." He quickly made contact with the agent again and explained there was another project in the pipeline. At this point, he was worried Pitt could already be committed for the next few years. Fortunately for the army of Pitt and Tarantino fans around the world, this was not the case. "His agent said Brad doesn't do that because he wants to be available when good material is offered." The rest, as they say, is history. "It was a lot of fun working with Brad, which wasn't very surprising," Tarantino told CNN. "We had already been told we would get along like a house on fire, and that's pretty much what happened." With Tarantino's revelation Tuesday on the Howard Stern Show that he and Brad had got through six bottles of wine and a "slice of hash" in one night, Angelina may be one of the few people hoping that this is not the start a beautiful relationship.

You can't turn on a 24-hour news channel or your nightly news this week without seeing a feature on African-American women voters. It makes sense, being that the South Carolina Democratic primary is only one day away and African-American women will make up approximately one-third of the voters. The angle in these news features is virtually identical. The commentators wonder and marvel at the extraordinarily difficult choice for African-American women in this primary -- will we vote for the woman candidate or the African-American candidate? Reporters have been busying themselves traveling to crowded beauty shops all over the state to answer this question. The funniest, or perhaps most disturbing, thing about these stories is how far they are from my reality. I am an African-American woman living in South Carolina. I have African-American women family members and friends who live in this state. I actually visit beauty shops to get my hair done. Never once have I heard a single woman I know frame the choice about whom to vote for as a question of gender or racial politics. So what are African-American women talking about when the cameras aren't watching or, more importantly, what are we telling the media that is not being fairly reported? African-American women are talking about the issues! We talk about the vision that each candidate has for leading this country. We enthusiastically discuss the possibility that real, positive change will come from this election. We even parse the policy distinctions in the candidates' positions on education, creating jobs and ending the war in Iraq. Sometimes, the issues we talk about do deal with aspects of gender and racial identity. We debated Sen. Hillary Clinton's statement implying that Martin Luther King's civil rights movement did not fulfill its promise until Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. We argue and marvel at the significant generational divide in the African-American community that is being exposed by this election process. If you listen closely to the women in the news features at the beauty shops, they are commenting on these issues, even when the voice-over in the same feature is telling you that the women are discussing whether it's more important to have the first woman or the first black president. Why is the media determined to make us choose? Why do they insist that we declare our loyalty to either women or to African-Americans? This is a truly false dichotomy in that we are the living, breathing embodiment of both identities. Asking us to prefer our gender over our race (or vice versa) is the equivalent of asking us to prefer one vital organ over another. That is not to say that identity politics are completely irrelevant in this election. African-American women are expressing their pride in both candidates and in the progress this country has made that allows a white woman and an African-American man to be strong contenders for the presidency. My mother is uplifted by the idea that Obama's candidacy means that her two grandsons will grow up being able to realistically dream about being president. On Saturday, we will carry this pride into the voting booth with us, but when we cast our votes, we will be thinking about the serious issues facing this country. That's the truth, and don't let the media tell you otherwise. E-mail to a friend
Cambodia's war crimes court Friday rejected the appeal a man who ran a Khmer Rouge regime torture prison and instead increased the man's sentence to life imprisonment. Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known by his alias, Duch, was appealing his 2010 conviction and 35-year sentence arguing that he was just following orders of senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime. Duch was 67 at the time of his convictions, which was for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. He was was the head of the S-21 prison where about 14,000 people died. Few people taken to the prison made it out alive; only about a dozen were found by the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1979. The judge, in announcing Duch's sentence in 2010 saiid he took into consideration that the defendant had expressed remorse, admitted responsibility and cooperated with the court. The judge also took into account the "coercive environment" of the Khmer Rouge, he said. Duch pleaded guilty and asked for forgiveness. In the trial, he argued that international law did not apply to him because he was just following orders. The tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on-and-off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and functioning of the court. The 2010 verdict was the court's first. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia.
David Petraeus, who resigned as director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the revelation of an extramarital affair, has been named a visiting professor at Macaulay Honors College at the City University of New York, the school's chancellor said Tuesday. Petraeus will assume the position in August, Matthew Goldstein, the chancellor, said. The university did not provide specifics about what Petraeus would be teaching. In a statement, the retired Army general indicated he will lead an economic seminar. "I look forward to leading a seminar at Macaulay that examines the developments that could position the United States -- and our North American partners -- to lead the world out of the current global economic slowdown," he said. Petraeus apologizes for affair Petraeus, who once ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from his CIA post in November. He resigned after admitting he had had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The affair came to light during an FBI investigation of "jealous" e-mails Broadwell reportedly sent to another woman. Opinion: Would a President Petraeus be in the cards?
The bullets that killed Colorado prison chief Tom Clements came from the gun found with a former inmate who died in a shootout with Texas police two days later, investigators confirmed Monday. The news came as Colorado held a public memorial service for Clements, the executive director of the state Department of Corrections. The El Paso County, Colorado, Sheriff's Department said it was still trying to determine whether the suspect in Clements' slaying, Evan Ebel, acted alone or what his motive may have been. "Tom Clements was a remarkable person," Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said. "He oversaw all of the coldest, darkest of worlds with the warmest and, you know, and most tender of hearts." FBI seeks links in Texas, Colorado killings Clements was shot to death Tuesday night at his home outside Colorado Springs. Ebel was killed Thursday in northern Texas after a gunbattle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded. The 28-year-old was a former white supremacist gang member and the son of a longtime friend of Hickenlooper. Police also said there is a "strong connection" between the killings of Clements and the killing of Nathan Collin Leon, a Denver pizza delivery driver who was found dead in suburban Golden. Investigators said they have been looking into whether Ebel might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements. The corrections chief earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on prison gangs, including the white supremacist 211s, who once counted Ebel among their ranks. Ebel got out of prison in late January after serving seven years -- three for felony menacing, robbery and assault, another four for assaulting a guard. He spent five years of that time in solitary confinement. It was his second stretch in prison, after doing one year of a three-year term for armed robbery. Ebel's father, attorney and former oil executive Jack Ebel, "was one of my first friends in Colorado," Hickenlooper said. But the governor said Evan Ebel "had an anger and a cruelty" from an early age. "He had a bad streak, and they tried everything," Hickenlooper said. "One of the things Tom fought for was we have too many people in solitary confinement with mental disorders like Evan Ebel, and we release them -- we won't release them in prison, we release them into the general public," Hickenlooper said. It was a "quiet crusade" for Clements to identify and treat mental illness among prisoners, he said. The governor said Clements' death was "incomprehensible, but I don't think it is part of a larger conspiracy." The Texas Rangers said Ebel opened fire on sheriff's deputies northwest of Dallas on Thursday. He slammed the black Cadillac he was driving into a tractor-trailer, then crawled out and fired more shots at deputies before being shot in the head. The 9mm pistol and a Domino's Pizza uniform jacket and box carrier were found with the Cadillac. Witnesses had reported a similar vehicle, -- a black, boxy car with Colorado license plates -- near Clements' home in Monument the day he was killed. Investigators had already said the brand and caliber of the shells found with the weapon were the same as those found at Clements' home. CNN's Brooke Baldwin and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.
An 11-mile stretch of the Mississippi River near Greenville, Mississippi, was closed Monday to most vessel traffic because of low water levels, idling nearly a hundred boats and barges in the stream, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. "We are allowing a limited number of vessels based on size" to attempt to pass, said New Orleans-based Coast Guard spokesman Ryan Tippets, adding that the closure was affecting 97 vessels Monday afternoon and was halting both northbound and southbound traffic. Salt creeping up the Mississippi River This same area near Greenville, which sees about 50 vessels pass on an average day, has been closed "intermittently" since August 12, when a vessel ran aground, said Tippets. The Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers have continued surveying the area and deemed it "dangerous for vessels to travel through," he said. The Army Corps of Engineers also has being dredging in the area to deepen the channel and help navigation. Complete coverage of the drought A historic drought and excessive heat have reduced water levels and scorched wide sections of the U.S. Midwest. Flooding last year may have worsened the situation on the Mississippi by leaving deposits of silt and debris in areas that would normally be clear. Tippiets said he was unsure when the river would reopen or, once that happens, how long it would take to undo the gridlock.

a conference of leaders brought together to consider family matters and sexuality -- leaned too far left for many among the bishops, especially in the first draft of their joint statement.  The Pope didn't give up, however, and will try again this coming year, with many fresh voices among his bishops. And the chances are that fresh teachings will emerge, as Francis clearly wants the church to be more open to gays and friendlier to couples who have been divorced. The Pope has also addressed the complicated issue of women in the church.  Last year, he declared that women "must have a greater role in the decision-making areas of the church."  He has also been sympathetic to the idea of giving women a greater role in the liturgical work of the church, arguing recently for a "more widespread and incisive female presence" in the church. Indeed, there is good theological ground for this, as the early church had female deacons, and St. Paul put great trust in female leaders, such as Lydia and Phoebe (a deacon with whom he entrusted his famous Letter to the Romans). It was not until quite late in the Christian movement that women were relegated to the sidelines, told to sit down and be quiet, and Paul's teachings on women in the church remain highly contradictory (a good summary can be found here, by Craig S. Keener). As with all scriptures, Paul's letters need to be read in context.  One must also take into consideration that not all of Paul's letters were by him:  Most scholars now believe that only seven of his letters were authentic, while the rest were by disciples of Paul -- "school of Paul," so to speak.  And many of these offered comments on women that were incompatible with the original seven letters, as John Dominic Crossan (one of the finest of biblical scholars) and others have persuasively argued. To be frank:  It seems to me unlikely that Pope Francis will ever allow women into the priesthood, let alone into the College of Cardinals.  But it also seems inevitable that these things will happen in due course. Still, the Francis revolution is real.  He has laid the groundwork for profound change, and it matters that he has now appointed a cadre of cardinals from parts of the world where poverty remains an abysmal problem.  This pope wants the church to be, above all else, a "church for the poor." In the first year of his papacy he wrote a strong Apostolic Exhortation in which he condemned "the invisible hand of the market" and pushed for economic reforms. This eloquent document was so radical, in fact, that even Rush Limbaugh stepped into the fray, calling it "pure Marxism." But this pope isn't a Marxist.  He's a deeply humble man who believes in social justice.  He regards Jesus as someone who identified with those on the margins of society, who declared: "Blessed are the poor."  This pope has consistently sided with those who have no power, and he has been unafraid to state his case, repeatedly, in unequivocal terms. The appointment of 20 new cardinals from the margins of the world will only add to his case, reforming the church structurally, from within.  While not every one of these cardinals shares the pontiff's views on gays and women in the church, there is no doubt that fresh voices will open the debate on any number of issues. This is a revolutionary pope, and his first two years in office have been breathtaking to watch.
A senior British lawmaker on Sunday condemned the execution in Belarus of one of two men convicted of a fatal subway bombing last year. Minister for Europe David Lidington said independent reports had raised "serious and credible concerns" over the standard of evidence and fairness of the trial that led to the conviction of the men, Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev. "The UK opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle and any miscarriage of justice leading to the death penalty is of course irreversible and irreparable," Lidington said, urging Belarus to halt all executions and work toward abolishing the death penalty. The men were sentenced to death for the April 2011 bombing that killed 15 people and wounded more than 200 at a subway station in Minsk. The scene from 2011 subway blast Kovalev's mother said Saturday her son had been executed by shooting, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti reported. She maintained her son's innocence. The private Belarus newspaper Telegraf reported Saturday that the other man, Konovalov, had also been shot dead. The European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton condemned the execution, saying Saturday the men, both citizens of Belarus, were not accorded due process. Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland condemned Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's decision not to pardon the men. "Belarus is the only country in Europe which still executes people," Jagland said. "With its disrespect of basic human rights and democratic standards, the government of Belarus is increasingly isolating its country and its people from the rest of the world." The bomb had been hidden beneath a bench and was filled with shrapnel, nails, and small metal balls and had the estimated power equivalent of 5 kilograms of TNT, the Belarusian state news agency Belta reported last year. In its ruling, the court described the two men as "explosive enthusiasts" and said they posed an "exceptional danger to society," according to RIA Novosti.
Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey lives in San Francisco, not New York. But the tech entrepreneur, who also founded mobile-payments company Square, tells "60 Minutes" he wants to move to New York someday and run for mayor. "What I love about New York is just the electricity I feel right away," he told CBS News' Lara Logan in a segment that aired Sunday. "It's chaos. It's kind of like being in a car in the middle of a thunderstorm. Everything is raging around you, but you're safe inside that car. So New York feels very much to me like that." With a net worth of more than $1 billion, Dorsey would follow in the footsteps of Michael Bloomberg as a billionaire-turned-New York politician. Moving to the Big Apple also would be a homecoming of sorts for Dorsey, who attended New York University and as a teenager was hired by a New York dispatch company after he hacked into its website. Dorsey, 36, grew up in St. Louis and spent a lot of time at home playing with computers and studying trains. He also had a police scanner and told CBS the inspiration for Twitter came from listening to the short bursts of chatter from the city's emergency dispatch center. "They're always talking about where they're going, what they're doing and where they currently are. And that is where the idea for Twitter came (from) ... ," said Dorsey, who created the code for Twitter's 140-character messages. "And (with cell phones) suddenly we could update where I was, what I'm doing, where I'm going, how I feel. And then it would go out to the entire world." In December, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users. Dorsey said he is proud of how quickly people adopted Twitter, which launched in 2006, "and used it in a million different ways. They're all over the world. And Twitter enables them to take a $5 cell phone and, wherever they are, communicate with the world for free." Launched in 2010, Square now has more than 400 employees and has been adopted by Starbucks to help the coffee chain process sales transactions. Dorsey said the idea for Square came from talking to a friend, a glassmaker, who was frustrated that he lost a $2,000 sale because he couldn't accept a credit card. Dorsey also said that to keep his employees inspired he leads company outings to a place in San Francisco called Lands End, which offers stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Dorsey says he admires the bridge's utility and elegant design, which he called "this perfect intersection between art and engineering," and believes software should work the same way.
Is Luis Suarez currently the world's best footballer? He is certainly making a case for himself. A day after the Uruguayan signed a new four-and-a-half year contract, Suarez found the back of the net two more times -- in brilliant fashion -- as Liverpool beat Cardiff City 3-1 to leapfrog Arsenal at the top of the English Premier League. "Two brilliant goals, a genuine world-class player," stated Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, to the club website. Suarez might have had a hat-trick, too, had he shot on goal instead of setting up Raheem Sterling on a two-man break Saturday. Suarez now has 19 league goals this season -- despite missing the first six matches of the campaign due to a ban. That's more than Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Diego Costa. His goals-per-game ratio in the league is also better than the high-profile trio, who ply their trade in Spain's La Liga. If Suarez keeps up his impressive pace, he will smash the record for most goals in a Premier League season. Suarez, deputizing as captain for the still injured Steven Gerrard, opened the scoring when he volleyed Jordan Henderson's chipped pass past David Marshall in the 25th minute. He unselfishly assisted on Sterling's tap in three minutes before the interval and made it 3-0 with a curled effort across goal in the 45th. Liverpool struck the bar twice in the first half, with Marshall thwarting Sterling. Cardiff pulled a goal back through Jordon Mutch's header in the 58th minute during a brief spell of superiority but Liverpool soon reasserted its control and Suarez hit the outside of the post on a rebound. "We played very well in the first half and in the second half not as well," Suarez told BT Sport. "But most important was that we won." Liverpool leads Arsenal by a point, though the Gunners can reclaim first spot Monday against Chelsea. Manchester City later went ahead of Arsenal on goal difference following a 4-2 win at Fulham and defending champion Manchester United ended a two-game league losing streak at home by downing West Ham 3-1 in a battle of teams who this week progressed to the last four of the League Cup. Liverpool visits Manchester City -- a perfect 8-0-0 at home with 35 goals scored -- in Boxing Day's standout clash. "We have been on a fantastic run," said Rodgers. "The quality of our football is at a really high level. We're pressing the game very well, our aggression to get the ball back is good. "We'll arrive there on Boxing Day in a really good moment. It's a game I'm really looking forward to." Manchester City has struggled away from home and looked like it might drop more points playing without injured striker Sergio Aguero after seeing a 2-0 lead turn to 2-2. But late goals by substitutes Jesus Navas and James Milner bailed out City. Ashley Young, another substitute, scored for the second consecutive game to add to first-half strikes for Danny Welbeck and Adnan Januzaj at Old Trafford. United overtook idle Tottenham for seventh. Newly promoted Cardiff stayed above the relegation zone but it may not be enough to prevent manager Malky Mackay from being dismissed by owner Vincent Tan. Tan -- in attendance at Anfield -- is reportedly dismayed by the amount of money Mackay spent on players in the off-season and wanted the former Scotland defender to resign. "I won't be walking away," Mackay told BT Sport. "That's the first thing. I'm proud to be the manager of Cardiff City." Elsewhere, Newcastle blanked Crystal Palace 3-0 to maintain its push for a Champions League berth; Stoke overcame the disappointment of losing to United in the League Cup quarterfinals by toppling Aston Villa 2-1; and West Bromwich Albion drew Hull 1-1 in its first match since the sacking of Steve Clarke. Ten-man Sunderland, which upset Chelsea in the League Cup, earned a point but stayed last after a 0-0 draw against Norwich.
(CNN)Rory McIlroy can focus on his driving and putting after settling a protracted legal dispute with his former management company. The World No.1 avoided a potentially long and drawn out court case in Dublin, Ireland, after attempting to sue Horizon Sports Management, who in turn were counter-suing the golfer  by claiming the Northern Irishman owed them millions of dollars in commission on contracts up to 2017. McIlroy had labeled the contract he had signed with Horizon as "unconscionable." "The legal dispute between Rory McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties who wish each other well for the future," said a joint statement from McIlroy and Horizon. "The parties will be making no further comment," added the statement. McIlroy reportedly paid $22.8m million plus costs to settle the case. In an interview with CNN's Living Golf show month, McIlroy insisted the case had been about taking "control of things myself." He added: "If there's one good thing that's came out of all of this, it's being able to set up my own management team and my own management company. "That's been huge. Even after all of this, having a great team around me and a great team in place, that's all been worth it." The period under dispute coincided with McIlroy's sponsorship deal with Nike, which was reported be worth around $100m. McIlroy, who won the Dubai Desert Classic last weekend, was not in court when the settlement was announced, though he did make a brief appearance on Tuesday. The 25-year-old had claimed that the fees charged by Horizon were excessive, while simultaneously being accused of breaching his contract and owing outstanding fees. McIlroy terminated his contract with Horizon in 2013 to set up his own company.
Sure David Copperfield can make the Statue of Liberty vanish in front of a live audience, but what can he do with an iPad? In a YouTube video posted by "salarymagician," Shinya -- who identifies himself as a magician at the beginning of the video -- incorporates the iPad in his sidewalk magic act, which just happens to take place in front of an Apple store. I'm not sure what's more impressive: How well he knows his way around an iPad, or how entertaining his magic tricks are. Different versions of the YouTube video have already been viewed more than 700,000 times. It doesn't really matter that many of Shinya's tricks probably wouldn't be possible without long sleeves and quick hands -- at one point he takes too long to pull a piece of cheese out of his sleeve. He redeems himself twice over when he makes a live dove appear in his hand moments after showing a video of it on the iPad screen. Another highpoint of Shinya's act is when he pretends to pour a glass of milk onto his iPad. Despite the fact that the contents of the glass are clearly staying put, it appears as though the milk has filled the virtual glass on the screen. Is this really magic? Probably not, but it looks pretty darn cool. Another cool, yet subtle, part of the video is when Shinya covers his face with the iPad. His moving face appears on the screen, but he's wearing glasses. When he removes the iPad, the same glasses are on his face. We should have seen this coming. Apple CEO Steve Jobs deemed the iPad "a truly magical and revolutionary product" when he unveiled the tablet-style computer in January. What can you do with your iPad?
Marina Abramovic is fixing her deep brown eyes on me. She gently takes my hand and leads me across London's Serpentine Gallery's marble floor, to a window whose white blinds are obscuring the greenery of Hyde Park beyond. She places her hand reassuringly on my back and whispers: "Ten minutes like this." Frankly, if she had asked me to stay there forever, I would have probably agreed. I have been charmed by the self-styled grandmother of performance art. The legendary Serbian-born New York-based artist is in London for the biggest show of her career, and she is revealing a small glimpse of it to a room full of enchanted international journalists. Entitled 512 Hours, the exhibition will see Abramovic in residence at the Serpentine Gallery for 64 days, spending eight hours a day with no breaks trying to create art out of nothing. The museum walls have been stripped, and there are some folding chairs and beds which she may or may not use in storage, but essentially, Abramovic is relying purely on an exchange of energy with her audience. "It took me 25 years to gather courage, concentration and knowledge to come to this" the formidable artist says, clad in an almost monastic outfit of black high-neck shirt, long overcoat and dark trousers. "It's difficult to say what I'm going to do because I don't know. What I do know is that in this piece I have to give not 100, but 120 per cent of myself, because only then I can create energy out of empty space." If this seems like an audacious proposal, Abramovic has managed to do something similar with aplomb before. For her 2010 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, over 850,000 people queued day and night just to sit opposite her, many breaking down in tears when finally faced with her. Mesmerizing appeal It's hard to think of another artist who can draw monumental crowds with such an airy concept, but after spending half an hour with Abramovic, you start to see the pull. Strikingly beautiful in the flesh and looking two decades younger than her 67 years, she exudes a mesmerizing mix of hypnotic energy, reassuring warmth and sharp wit. Even so, what makes people from all walks of life, as seen in New York, wait for hours just to be in her presence? "Connection," says Julia Peyton-Jones, co-director of the Serpentine Gallery, who first invited Abramovic to stage a show after she won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1997. "When we grow older we lose that connection with other people, and Marina helps us regain it through her." In a career spanning over 40 years, Abramovic has constantly challenged the notions of what art should be, using her body as an instrument, and sometimes risking her life in the process. She has lain inside a burning star of sawdust, had a crossbow pointed to her heart, and even allowed the audience to prod and cut her naked body as she lay motionless. "Every performance has a concept, and when I set out the rules I stick to them no matter what, "the artist told me over the phone when I interviewed her about the Marina Abramovic Institute, a space she is creating in Hudson, New York, for development and study of performance art. "Even if in the end I don't survive, I don't care," she says. Iron willpower This steely resolve could be attributed to her upbringing in post-World War II Belgrade, as the daughter of two national heroes ordained for bravery. Her family valued achievement above all, and household rules were strict: "Until I was 29 years old and left home I had a curfew of 10 pm, so all my performances had to be done by that time. "I think I inherited self-control and discipline from my parents, and the idea that your personal life isn't important, but that what you achieve matters," she explained in her thick Slavic accent, only slightly softened by the years she has spent abroad. However, her ascetic approach to her craft has not stopped her from being the darling of the celebrity art circuit. She has danced with Jay Z in his music video, counts James Franco and Lady Gaga as loyal fans and friends, and was named as one of Time Magazine's most influential people of 2014. These mainstream accolades have led some critics to accuse Abramovic of losing her avant-garde edge, a judgment that doesn't seem to faze her: "I stepped out of an art context into a much larger context, but if anything, I have become more radical. At my age I should be having a nice retrospective, go on holidays, but instead, I decided to push myself like never before and create art out of nothing, it's not easy you know," she says laughing. It takes less than 10 minutes in her company to see that for Abramovic, art and life are one thing. Even the act of breaking up with her lover and collaborator of many years Ulay was a performance -- they both walked the Great Wall of China from opposite directions, meeting for one final embrace in the middle. Her unconventional lifestyle has left little place for other people in her world, but you get the sense that the way she lives is less of a choice and more of a necessity: "I wake up every day with so many ideas, and the desire to create is as strong as the need to breathe. For me, art is my cause," the formidable artist tells me. For those who have hoped to snap a selfie with the grand dame at her Serpentine show, bitter disappointment awaits -- Abramovic is asking her audience to leave their gadgets at home: "I don't want people to blog or Tweet it without experiencing it. The now is the only reality we have in our lives," she says. It seems that at a time when the pace of life threatens to engulf us, Marina Abramovic wants us to slow down and live in the present.

We met her in the car park of a small shopping mall on the edge of Mbabane, Swaziland's capital. She was too shy to get out of the car her friend had brought her in, too nervous of who might see, or what might be overheard. She told us that she knew an isolated place where we could talk. Ten minutes later we are in scrubland standing by the rubble and remains of someone's home. Here Nelsie - not her real name - stops fiddling with her plastic necklace and starts looking me in the eye, but even that appears to take considerable effort. She tells me that for the last two years, since both her parents died in a car crash, she has lived on the periphery, isolated from her remaining family and society. "Right now I don't feel that I am a human being" she confesses. "Right now I am scared to greet my family because if I say that I am a prostitute all of the people will just say that I am a prostitute". She wants us to know that this was not her first choice; she did try to find work. "Here in Swaziland there are no jobs" she says. The necklace fiddling starts again. "I have no choice to be a sex worker, whether I like it or not, I must do that". Tucked away in one corner of Swaziland's annual International Trade Fair we find the HIV/AIDS stands. It is an unusual addition at a trade fair but then so is the large number of children who have come here for a day out with their parents; there is barely a businessman or woman in sight. These stands are testimony to a tragic accolade; Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV and AIDS in the world. A staggering one in four people have HIV/AIDS in Swaziland. Read related: Opinion: How to end AIDS At one stand Zelda Nhlabatsi, who runs the Family Life Association of Swaziland, is trying to raise awareness about the disease. The free condoms on her table seem to have attracted quite a crowd. Her organization offers support and education to sex workers and she believes there is a growing number of women, just like Nelsie, who are turning to prostitution because of the country's financial woes. "Everyone needs food, those are basic needs and the unemployment rate is quite high so sex work for most people is a livelihood you know". And the situation is likely to get worse she warns me. "You are going to be seeing more and more people engaging in different kinds of work, including sex work." Swaziland's government blames the financial woes on a drop in income from the Southern African Customs Union following a new tariff deal. Organizations like the IMF have urged Swaziland's government to cut its bloated civil service, reduce spending and attract foreign investors. At the height of the crisis, anti retrovirals were scarce, cancer treatment was stopped and schools were closed. According to the African Development Bank, youth unemployment in Swaziland is currently over fifty percent. Political parties may be banned here but the unions are emboldened and have led angry protests on the streets. Read related: South African girl brides abducted as fabled HIV cure South Africa's President Zuma has offered some respite after the IMF refused Swaziland a loan. A three hundred and fifty five million dollar bailout was agreed but so far, none of that money has materialized. Majozi Sithole, Swaziland's Finance minister, tells me. "Right now I am not sure, we are waiting for the South Africans to engage with us whether that money is still available or not and if it is then we will gladly take it. It will assist us in meeting some of the fiscal challenges that we are currently facing but if it is not available then we are already taking steps to say let's look at what we have." Critics of King Mswati believe he and his array of wives have contributed to the financial demise of this small landlocked kingdom. There are reports of shopping trips to Europe, a private jet from a private sponsor and plans for a second international airport for a country with just over one million people. However, the country's finance minister denies this. "I can assure you that his Majesty, the Royal Family, they never overspend in what they have been allocated. If there are any challenges then they are in other ministries," he tells me when we met him in his office. "Those who would blame it on his Majesty they do not have the information, he never overspends, we discuss the fiscal challenges on a weekly basis, I brief him, he has concerns and he will, as he did this year, say whatever you work don't even increase my budget because I understand the fiscal situation."

Pop star David Cassidy filed suit on Wednesday against Sony, claiming he was not paid for his image on merchandise from the hit television show, "The Partridge Family," in which he starred. "For nearly 40 years, defendants have swindled Mr. Cassidy out of his rightful share of the profits from The Partridge Family, and when Mr. Cassidy has inquired as to the matter, have lied to him so as to continue to conceal their deception," said the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. "Mr. Cassidy has reason to believe, and does reasonably believe, that defendants have been perpetrating a scam" and "will continue to go to any and all lengths necessary, no matter how despicable, to avoid upholding" his contract, the suit said. Named as defendants are Sony Pictures Entertainment, and subsidiaries Screen Gems Inc. and CPT Holdings Inc. The suit, which alleges fraud and breach of contract, demands "in excess of millions of dollars, in amount to be determined at trial." A Sony spokeswoman said the company does not comment on matters involving litigation. In an interview with CNN, Cassidy, 61, said he simply wants what's owed to him. "It's just a matter of being fair, and doing the right thing," Cassidy said. "I have no other alternative if Sony is not going to be reasonable." He told CNN that his former manager told him he has only been paid about $5,000 for merchandise. "I'm going to let a jury decide if David Cassidy is entitled to his fair share," he told CNN. Under his 1971 contract with Screen Gems, Cassidy was supposed to get 15 percent of net merchandising revenues for the use of his image, voice or likeness, and no more than half of that for items in which that if other cast members appeared. "Mr. Cassidy quickly became a teen idol," the suit, filed by attorneys Kenneth Linzer, Rachael Shinoskie and Elisha Weiner, states. "At the height of the show's success, he received an average of 30,000 letters from fans a week; having the largest fan club in the world in its day, surpassing even Elvis Presley and The Beatles." The suit said the show, which aired from 1970 to 1974, was one of the first -- if not the first -- to be merchandized on a worldwide scale with board games, magazines, coloring books, paperbacks, posters, pillow cases, toy guitars, dollars, lunch boxes, beach towels, pencil cases, comic books, children's' clothing, and music sales. "All of which, it has been reported by knowledgeable news sources, generated nearly $500 million for defendants," the suit said. Despite promises in his 1971 contract to provide financial statements for merchandising, Sony has "either never provided such accountings and reports, or provided such accountings and reports only begrudgingly, inconsistently, inaccurately and fraudulently." In a letter sent to Sony in May, Cassidy's attorney Craig Marshall, requested a full accounting of the merchandise. "We are formally requesting an accounting and payment for any and all sale, exploitation, or other use of Cassidy's name, likeness, voice or other exercise of such merchandising rights," states the letter to Gregory Boone, executive vice president of legal affairs for Sony Pictures Television. "In that regard, we also request a prompt and full accounting and payment of proceeds for any merchandise that was sold, exploited or otherwise used subsequent to the rights period set forth in the agreement." Boone responded in a letter that Sony "could not (and so far as we know did not) enter into any new merchandising licenses" using Cassidy's "name, voice and likeness rights" after the show went off the air. "We have searched for copies of the merchandising net proceeds rendered to Mr. Cassidy in the 1970s, but have been unable to locate them," the letter said. "However, we did find some correspondence...showing that Mr. Cassidy's representatives audited such statements. Therefore, they must have been rendered to him." Any potential claims, the letter said, are invalid because the "statutes of limitation" had expired decades ago. Asked why he waited so long to raise the merchandising issue, Cassidy said he didn't have a copy of his contract until, after a string of moves and business managers, he found it in a box that he hadn't opened since the 1970s. Besides his claims that he was cheated out of merchandising revenues, he said new merchandise from the show has continued to be produced in the last 10 years. He said, since the merchandising rights reverted to him one year after the show went off the air and he was entitled to profits from the show, he was supposed to also get paid for any new merchandise. For example, Cassidy showed CNN a "The Partridge Family" toy bus and model kit with a 2001 copyright. The company that manufactured the toy, Playing Mantis Inc., has since been sold. But a spokeswoman for the new company confirmed that the toy was produced in 1998 and again in 2001 with Sony's permission. A toy hamster that sings "I Think I Love You" also has a 2001 copyright from Gemmy Industries Corp. Lio Chang, a company vice president, told CNN that Gemmy got permission to use music from a Sony subsidiary. Still another "Partridge Family" toy bus has a 2003 copyright from CPT Holdings, which is Columbia Pictures Television, a Sony subsidiary. A Sony spokeswoman had no comment when CNN asked about these recent copyrights. The only other cast member reached by CNN from "The Partridge Family" who said he received money from merchandising is Brian Forster, who replaced Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge is the second season. Forster said he received about $1,100, after his mother demanded payment from the studio. The other cast members contacted by CNN said they either didn't have a merchandising clause in their contracts or do not remember getting paid. Cassidy's comments to CNN follow interviews earlier this year with cast members of "Happy Days," who are suing CBS over the same issue. Actors Don Most, Anson Williams, Marion Ross and Erin Moran, as well as the widow of actor Tom Bosley, filed a $10 million suit in April, claiming CBS, which owns the show, failed to pay them for "Happy Days" merchandise, which is still being sold around the world. After the lawsuit was filed, CBS Corp. sent checks to the actors totaling $43,403. But Jon Pfeiffer, the actors' attorney, said he would not cash the checks while the case is pending because that would imply his clients agree with CBS that is all they are owed." In a statement, CBS said it agreed the actors are owed money for the merchandise, but dispute the amount. In a court filing, the company said the actors are "attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action" for fraud and breach of good faith. CBS said this was "all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages" in the case. But the actors fired back in court papers, saying "although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images, they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth." For Cassidy, he said the issue with "The Partridge Family" is the same -- where did all the merchandising money go? "I'm asking for fairness, I'm asking to be treated with respect as opposed to, 'we don't owe you anything,'" Cassidy said.
British jets sent to join the fight against ISIS have conducted reconnaissance missions but have not yet targeted any militant positions, the country's Ministry of Defence said Saturday. The intelligence gathered by the aircraft will help determine targets for future missions, according to the ministry. They're ready to strike when necessary, the ministry said. The Royal Air Force Tornadoes were sent from the Akrotiri air base in Cyprus to Iraq, according to the defense ministry. Photographs released by the ministry appeared to show two aircraft. A tanker aircraft supported the British fighters, the Ministry of Defence said, adding that U.K. transport aircraft continued to deliver supplies to Kurdish forces fighting ISIS. Parliament authorized airstrikes by British forces on Friday against ISIS in Iraq, but not Syria. How much will it cost Britain to bomb ISIS? 'Not the stuff of fantasy' The 524-43 vote to join the air campaign came after Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the country had a "duty to take part" in international efforts to combat the extremist group. The terror group is an organization of "staggering" brutality, he said, which has already killed one British hostage and threatens the lives of two more. "This is not a threat on the far side of the world; left unchecked, we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean and bordering a NATO member, with a declared and proven determination to attack our country and our people," he said. The anatomy of ISIS: How it is run, from oil to beheadings "This is not the stuff of fantasy; it is happening in front of us; and we need to face up to it." The government insists such action is legal because Iraq's government has requested international help to tackle the Sunni extremist group, which has overrun vast swathes of Iraq and Syria and massacred religious minorities and Shia Muslims. Anti-ISIS coalition grows, but that doesn't mean victory is near Wariness over new Iraq action The parliamentary authorization, which was backed by the three main Westminster parties, rules out the use of UK troops in any possible ground combat operations in Iraq. Many lawmakers who spoke in the debate before the vote voiced wariness over new military action in Iraq given the way the 2003 war turned out. UK forces already have been taking part in surveillance and reconnaissance missions over Iraq, as well as aiding Kurdish forces with equipment. Everything you need to know about the rise of the 'Islamic State' The United States and a handful of Arab nations began bombing raids in Syria this week against ISIS targets. U.S. aircraft had already been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS -- the group also known as ISIL, which calls itself the Islamic State -- in Iraq since last month. French fighter jets have also carried out bombing raids in Iraq, while Belgium and Denmark have also said they will provide planes.

It is one of a handful global landmarks that needs no introduction. The Colosseum in Rome is an Italian icon and a relic that dates back to the first century A.D. -- lions, gladiators, chariots and all. But with so many historic landmarks to care for -- like the Colosseum, the Spanish Steps and the Leaning Tower of Pisa -- Italy is beginning to struggle to manage its vast portfolio alone. This is a fact now readily acknowledged by the country's political hierarchy, with new methods to pay for the upkeep of these magnificent structures being sought. "To me, this belongs to the entire mankind," Rome mayor Ignazio Marino told CNN as he looked out over the Italian capital from a balcony at City Hall. "We have to share projects and ideas but we have to the share responsibility to maintain these for the generations to come," he added. The Colosseum brings in nearly $50 million every year but much of this money now goes to pay for the upkeep of less visited treasures across the city. Problems regarding funding started during the global financial crisis a little over five years ago. In 2014 alone, the city of Rome ran a deficit of over $1 billion dollars and required a federal decree to bail it out. These budgetary issues are complicated further by social and professional movements pressuring their representatives elected representatives on a number of issues such as pay and public services. On the sprightly spring day that CNN visited the Eternal City, junior doctors were on the streets seeking a pay hike. There are some, however, who say that if there is any hope of bringing back the days of "La Dolce Vita," Italy needs to bundle its history with what the world sees as the Italian lifestyle. It is here that the private sector has begun to play its part. According to Diego Della Valle, owner of high end shoemaker, Tod's, the nation's biggest companies have a responsibility to maintain Italian monuments as they are all part of the same brand experience. DDV, as he is known, is spending $34 million on a five year scrubbing of the travertine marble front of the Colosseum. "The most important things is the tourist project ... (or) if you want we call it the Made in Italy project," Della Valle said. Elsewhere, Bulgari is putting $2 million into the Spanish Steps while fashion house Fendi has offered up nearly $3 million for the equally famous Trevi Fountain. Rome's mayor himself has even ventured to Saudi Arabia seeking patrons from the energy rich state. It's a cap in hand call to action that the founders of this once mighty empire would have never considered. While Rome wasn't built in a day, it may also take a little longer find the coin required to preserve its finest and most treasured monuments.

A U.S. Navy commander, a Naval Criminal Investigative Service agent and a Singapore-based defense contractor face federal charges in two bribery schemes involving hundreds of millions of dollars in Navy contracts with payoffs that included prostitutes and luxury travel, according to the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego. The three men -- Navy Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz; NCIS Supervisory Special Agent John Bertrand Beliveau II and contractor Leonard Glenn Francis, the CEO of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd., -- were all arrested earlier this week. According to a news release from the U.S. attorney's office, Misiewicz, 46, used a position as deputy operations officer of the U.S. Seventh Fleet to help schedule visits of U.S. Navy ships to ports where Francis' company provided services including tugboats, security, transportation, supplies, fuel and waste removal. "In return, Francis provided Misiewicz with paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services," the U.S. attorney's office said. The information Misiewicz passed on to Francis, a citizen of Malaysia who lives in Singapore, was "confidential," meaning its disclosure could cause serious harm to U.S. national security, the U.S. attorney's office said. It detailed Navy ship movements months in advance, according to the U.S. attorney. A separate complaint alleges Beliveau, 44, provided Francis with information about an NCIS fraud investigation into his company's dealings with the Navy. "In exchange, Francis provided Beliveau with, among other things, paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services," the U.S. attorney's office said. The complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of California, states that Beliveau made arrangements to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, through the same travel agent Francis used. Read the complaint No evidence was found that Beliveau paid for his hotel or travel, or that he reimbursed Francis for the trip. Francis also arranged for a female escort to entertain Beliveau while there, according to the complaint. In e-mail correspondence between the two as detailed in the complaint, Francis attached a picture of the escort saying: "Joyce your kinda Babe?" Beliveau responded: "Nice. You bet. Hopefuly I'm her kinda guy, hehe." Francis allegedly paid for three days of the escort's time, including her airfare, according to the complaint. In all, the complaint alleges that Francis received the three-day trip to Thailand, escort included; a laptop for a female acquaintance; and went on a three-week, five-country trip through Asia. In return, Francis allegedly saved 125 NCIS investigative reports to his government computer. The affidavit states the reports were in connection with the NCIS investigation into Glenn Defense Marine Asia -- Francis' company. According to the complaint, after many of the downloads the CD burner was activated, but it's unclear what, if anything, was burned. The affidavit alleges that Francis burned the documents to a CD so that he could transport them out of the NCIS office. The special agent who wrote the affidavit wrote that there is no "direct proof" that Beliveau gave Francis the downloaded documents. The three men are charged with conspiring to commit bribery and could face up to five years in prison if convicted. Francis is being held without bond in San Diego, where he was arrested. Navy SEAL video game scandal Beliveau was arrested in Virginia and Misiewicz in Colorado, where he was serving with the U.S. Northern Command at Peterson Air Force Base. Both men are expected to be sent to San Diego to face the charges against them. If true, the allegations against Misiewicz will tarnish what has been an inspiring immigrant success story. Born in Cambodia and adopted by an American woman serving in the U.S. Army in Phnom Penh, Misiewicz came to the U.S. in 1973, a few years before the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia. Millions died during the group's brutal reign in what became known as the "Killing Fields." Misiewicz went on to earn his commission from the U.S. Naval Academy and in 2010 was in command of the destroyer USS Mustin when it made a port call in Cambodia. "It is important for me to be strong and to remember and honor the sacrifices that were made for me," Misiewicz said at the time, according to a Navy News Service report. "Both Cambodians and Americans in my young life sacrificed life and happiness so I could have a better life." "Anything is possible. You can start anywhere, any place, if you've got freedom and you have opportunity like we have in the U.S., the sky is the limit," he said in the report. Navy: Captain relieved, others investigated over questionable videos
Pounding humidity, a treacherous climb and bees who were more than happy to sting: Tough conditions for ash boarding down a live volcano, and halfway up Nicaragua's Cerro Negro, it didn't seem like such a good idea. But then there was the view: A cascade of grey-black ash and rock stretching to the horizon, giving the hilly landscape an alien quality. We walked in single file carrying our boards and a bag full of gear for nearly an hour until we reached the summit. Approaching the edge of the volcano, the 1,600 foot slope was pretty steep and uninviting. Our guide consoled us with the knowledge that we were lucky to have our plywood and metal boards as someone else had gone down the volcano on a bicycle. And nearly died. Still, I donned my prison-style boiler suit and goggles, sat on the board and let myself slide. It was a thrill as I quickly gathered speed, scraping over pebbles and eating flying grit until I finally wiped out at the bottom. The activity is one of Nicaragua's more unusual tourist hooks. Pioneered by the Australian owner of a hostel in the nearby city of Leon in 2005, ash boarding down Central America's youngest volcano has become a cottage industry. The Bigfoot hostel is now owned by Brazilian Breno Oliveira, who says the tourism industry is becoming more competitive as it develops. "When Bigfoot first started it, it was something new. And then it became bigger and bigger. This brings a lot of business," says Oliveira. Competition is growing. He says hotels and hostels in Leon have grown from two to more than 40 in seven years. "This to be honest is the main income of the hostel, if it didn't have the ash boarding it would just be a hostel and it becomes very difficult to survive." Tourism's role For many, especially in the United States, Nicaragua is associated with 1980s-era Marxist guerillas and the Iran-Contra scandal. Corruption and U.S. embargoes certainly took their toll on the country and by the time the Sandinistas left power in 1990, the tourism industry was a basket case. Yet Nicaragua has always had huge potential. Known as the "Land of Lakes and Volcanoes," it has immense natural beauty and alluring colonial towns. It's still very underdeveloped -- the second poorest country in the hemisphere -- and you can expect to experience power cuts and traffic jams behind horse carts on main highways. Per capita income is barely more than $1,200 a year, so for a country like Nicaragua, tourism is actually the second largest industry -- and an engine for lifting the population out of poverty. The latest figures for this year reveal an increase in visitors of 12% from 2011. "The tourism industry of Nicaragua has been growing at an important rate in the last few years," says Mario Salinas, the country's Tourism Minister. "And it's becoming one of the two or three top generators of foreign currency and employment for our country." A mandatory destination on any itinerary is Grenada. Perched on Lake Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America, the city is renowned for its stunning architecture. It was founded by the Spanish in 1524 and subsequently razed three times by pirates but was rebuilt and served as a conservative stronghold during the country's civil war. The city is overshadowed by the hulking Mombacho Volcano, a popular hiking destination. There is also a galaxy of hundreds of small islands formed from a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago and strewn across Lake Nicaragua. Driving down the lake's malecon looking for a tour boat, it was clear waterfront development had been approached with great ambition. Somehow the vision fell short: rows of bars, restaurants and nightclubs looked like they had been closed for months. Once out on the lake, the tranquil tour of the islets gives you the opportunity to gawp at the holiday homes of some of the country's richest families. Each dominate certain sections of the economy -- such as media or brewing -- and naturally each owns an islet. Occasional "For sale" signs rise up out of the water, and in case you're interested, an island will set you back around $400,000 -- negotiable. Country at a crossroads But be careful. According to the U.S. State Department, property laws in Nicaragua are somewhat murky: "Establishing verifiable title history is often entangled in legalities relating to the expropriation of 28,000 properties by the revolutionary government in the 1980s." The State Department says this remains a key impediment to attracting greater foreign investment in the tourism industry, a claim Salinas obviously rejects. "There are many international agreements that Nicaragua has signed with other countries to protect the safety of foreign investment," he says. "We haven't seen complications from 2007 until now and what could have happened is that the government may have verified a few properties to be completely sure of the origin of those properties." The Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega, once dismissed as a dinosaur, swept back into power in 2007 and has since been re-elected in an election condemned by international observers for its irregularities. Many may balk at the return of such a notorious figure, but the government says he is making tourism a priority and understands the conditions needed to attract visitors. San Juan del Sur has certainly maintained its inviting atmosphere. The laid back surfing mecca is close to the border with Costa Rica and may be the ideal place to wind down your tour. A young Mark Twain famously arrived here by boat in 1866 and was entranced by the "bright green hills" that form a semi-circle around the bay. Then a ramshackle primitive port, San Juan has grown into a ramshackle party town whose waterfront is lined with several bars catering to young tourists. During the day, the local tourism industry exploits the town's natural blessings. San Juan's main beach is largely a fishing and transit hub and the main surfing spots are a 20-minute drive away. The roads deteriorate rapidly as you leave town and a 4x4 vehicle was needed to get through the final stages of one route to the beach. But like Nicaragua as a whole, it's worth the effort: The waves are superb and the shorelines shockingly underdeveloped and wild. Nonsurfers can head to the high seas for some world-class deep-sea fishing and may be surprised at their unusual level of success. Nicaragua holds a great variety of experiences for any visitor, and the country is one of few states whose immediate future really is tied to the tourism industry. For now, it's seemingly at a crossroads, with many of the big developers watching the turn of events.
The British government asked the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee to redact small parts of the panel's report that criticized the CIA's harsh interrogation program, a representative for Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday. The comment came in response to a question from CNN about whether the UK government had seen the report on the CIA's enhanced interrogation program before it was released to the public this week, and whether London had asked for redactions or changes. "The U.S. gave our agencies limited sight of some sections of the executive summary before its publication," Cameron's representative said about the report on the CIA program, which critics call torture. "Our agencies highlighted a small number of issues in the proposed text where changes would be necessary to protect UK national security and intelligence operations. "None of these redactions related to allegations of UK involvement in detainee mistreatment." Related: CIA feared for future of interrogation program, report shows Information on what was altered or obscured in the 499-page executive summary at the UK government's request wasn't immediately available.

Russia has announced a ban on fresh vegetable imports from the European Union in the wake of a deadly E. coli outbreak that has swept across parts of Europe, state media reported Thursday. "The ban will be in effect until we become convinced that this situation is resolved -- that is, when the source of the infection is located and it is established how it is being transmitted, but most importantly, when the outbreak is contained and people stop getting infected and dying," Gennady Onishchenko, head of the Russian Federal Agency for Health and Consumer Rights, told the state-run ITAR-TASS news agency. Frederic Vincent, the European Commission health spokesman, called the move "disproportionate." "The commission will be writing today to the Russian authorities and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution," Vincent said. The commission is the EU's executive body. Customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country, according to Onishchenko.  Supermarkets and food chains in Russia were told to withdraw European vegetables from their produce bins. The ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the European part of the country, where about 90% of vegetables are imported, said Sergey Shugayev, chairman of the Rural Russia Association. China and Turkey are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into Russia, according to the Russian Greenhouses Association. The outbreak is responsible for 15 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, according to the World Health Organization.  The outbreak has sickened more than 1,000 people in at least 10 countries. The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But the source has not yet been pinpointed, authorities said. The ban on fresh vegetables from the European Union comes three days after Russia blocked the import of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and salad greens from Germany and Spain.  On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates imposed a temporary ban on cucumbers from Spain, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.
Two teenage brothers were arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Autumn Pasquale, the 12-year-old-girl found dead Monday in Clayton, New Jersey, according to authorities. "The brothers are ages 15 and 17 years old, and both are in police custody at the present time," Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said Tuesday, adding that the younger brother had also been charged with one count of luring. Prosecutors say Autumn was lured to the boys' home, where they murdered her -- possibly for her BMX bike, which police found among some of the girl's belongings when they searched the site early Tuesday. Autumn's body was found in a recycling container. Dalton said she was strangled and died from blunt-force trauma, but based on preliminary findings, there were no signs of sexual assault. Police were aided by the suspects' mother, who contacted police because of Facebook postings, according to Dalton. The young suspects turned themselves in, accompanied by their attorneys, Tuesday. "We're strongly considering waiving them to adult court. However, we want to let the process take its part," Dalton said. In New Jersey, authorities are not permitted to release the names of juveniles charged with a crime. A Facebook page was created after Autumn went missing Saturday, and many neighbors and friends donated their time to help 200 law enforcement members search for her. She was last seen riding her bike from her home, according to the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office. Neighbor Joyce Fisher described to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey how she felt after volunteering and handing out fliers for the search effort, only to find out that those accused live just across the street. "I'm exhausted," she said, and was especially unnerved when she saw investigators bring the girl's bike out of the suspects' house. "Scared ... devastating ... unnerving. Nice quiet town. We know everybody's move around here. We never had any issues like this," she said. "Everything is shattered." "At this point, we have to put our anger aside," Dalton said. "We have to let justice take its course and through the support of all the caring families in Clayton, with the support of the law enforcement community. ... We'll get past this, because we are strong." Pasquale would have celebrated her 13th birthday next week. CNN's Rick Martin contributed to this report.
Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old barrister and mother of three, and Tori Johnson, the manager of the cafe. Victims of Sydney siege 'I share the exasperation' Monis was on bail for violence criminal offenses at the time of the attack. He had a long history of mental illness and violence, the Prime Minister said. "This was the act of someone who was way beyond any mainstream, any mainstream, and has been rightly, absolutely repudiated by all the communities of Australia," Abbott told the Australian broadcaster. "We want to know why he wasn't being monitored, given his history of violence, his history of mental instability, and his history of infatuation with extremism." At the news conference in Canberra later in the day, he also raised questions about how Monis was able to obtain permanent residency in Australia, as well as welfare benefits. "I share the exasperation of the Australian public at what appears to be someone who's been having a lend of us, for many years," Abbott told reporters. He also said that the gunman had a firearms license, but the Australian Federal Police later clarified that that wasn't true. The federal police, who had originally given Abbott the erroneous information, said the confusion arose from an entry in a national database that was now being investigated. At the news conference, Abbott said he also wanted to know why Monis seemed to have fallen off Australian security agencies' watch lists in 2009. But he offered little in the way of details about what took place in the final hours of the siege. "When you are in a firefight, all sorts of things happen," Abbott told reporters. "The important thing for the police in a situation like that is to take care of the terrorist as quickly as possible." He said that on the police's advice, he had refused to act on the gunman's demand to talk to him during the siege. As authorities work to find the answer to that, and other unanswered questions, a makeshift memorial has sprung up in Sydney as people come to pay tribute to the victims. Thousands of people have left flowers, cards and signed condolence books. "We're a country that is not innocent of these issues," Kim Beazley, Australian ambassador to the United States, told CNN's "The Lead With Jake Tapper," on Wednesday. "We are well-prepared in many ways, but we weren't well-prepared enough for this particular man, in this particular place, and that will require investigation," he said.
Tens of millions in the central and eastern United States are bearing the full brunt of summer, in all its sweltering and stormy fury. Temperatures Friday soared past 100 degrees Fahrenheit from Topeka, Kansas, to Washington, and the same scorching conditions are expected to continue through the weekend and beyond. Even as evening set in Friday, the headaches weren't over. A powerful line of severe thunderstorms moved across the Midwest -- "fueled by record-high temperatures across the region," according to the National Weather Service -- bringing with them lightning and wind gusts as strong as 80 mph. As they moved east from Indiana through Ohio and into West Virginia, the storms caused damage that contributed to power outages that affected more than 2 million homes by 11:30 p.m. ET Friday, according to utilities. "The storms may reach as far as the Atlantic coast by late tonight or early Saturday morning," the weather service said. "People planning outdoor activities this evening in the path of the squall line are urged to pay attention to local weather warnings and take shelter as storms approach." It's part of a massive system that has left one in three Americans baking in scorching heat and has threatened lives and doled out misery for those not fortunate enough to find a splash of cool water or air conditioning. Heat warnings, watches or advisories Friday spanned 730,000 square miles of the central and eastern United States, an area roughly the size of Mexico, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. About 100 million people were affected, he said. "If you don't have a good pair of boots, it'll burn clear through to your feet," said roofer Zach Bruner in Evansville, Indiana, where he said the 103-degree temperatures were spiking to 130 on the job site. WIS: Lexington, South Carolina, police battle heat Joyce Ablog, a dentist in the same southwestern Indiana city, tested the heat by putting a sheet of raw cookies inside her car. Hours later, she found them nice and brown -- if not necessarily cooked all the way through. "I've always heard about it being so hot I'd fry an egg on a sidewalk," she told HLN on Friday. "I really don't want to try to eat an egg off the sidewalk. So I thought, why not cookies?" By midafternoon Friday, temperatures had climbed to 100 degrees in Indianapolis; 101 in Richmond, Virginia; and 102 degrees in St. Louis, where highs were forecast to stay above 100 through Thursday, the National Weather Service said. And it felt even hotter in some places, with the heat index topping out around 115 degrees. KSHB: Man, infant dead because of Kansas City heat The Jackson County medical examiner, in western Missouri, is investigating three deaths that may be related to the heat, according to information on the Kansas City Health Department's Twitter feed. One case involves a male, born in 1952, and a young boy born last year; the other suspected heat-related death is another man, born in 1943. The medical examiner in Harris County, Texas, is also looking into whether a 62-year-old Houston woman found Thursday died from heat-related causes, CNN affiliate KHOU reported. Some places have been sweltering for days, and there's little relief in sight for many with temperatures expected to remain roasting through next week, if not longer. "Heat-related illness such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke are a real threat," the National Weather Service said in issuing an excessive heat warning through Sunday for eastern Missouri, including St. Louis, where temperatures should soar up to 106 this weekend. "This is especially true because of the longevity of this heat wave, and the effects of extreme heat are cumulative." In Springfield, about 215 miles southwest of St. Louis, high temperatures prompted city officials to open eight cooling centers and extend pool hours, steps similar to those taken by many other municipalities, including ones more than 1,000 miles away in the Washington area. 5 tips to survive extreme heat In Memphis, Tennessee, where highs hit 105 degrees Friday, firefighters went door to door, checking on residents to make sure they're bearing the weather well. Churches and faith-based institutions were also urged to reach out to people and to ask people to check on their neighbors and relatives. WCSC: New weather bug system could keep carriage horses healthy "Please, if you know of someone who doesn't have air conditioning or who might be struggling with the heat, just stop by and see how they are doing," Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. urged residents in a news release. Excessive heat warnings, issued by the National Weather Service when "a prolonged period of dangerously hot temperatures will occur," were posted for 12 states, from Nebraska to New Jersey, with watches and advisories posted for at least six other states. Arizona was also under an excessive heat warning, with a predicted high Friday in the Phoenix area of 112 degrees. In locales not doused by thunderstorms, excessive heat is affecting air quality. Citizens of metro Atlanta experienced their first "code red smog alert" since 2010, according to the Clean Air Campaign, a partnership between employers and the state transportation department. Other metro areas on the East Coast were also feeling the heat and its repercussions. That includes New York, where there is an air quality alert and heat advisory out through the weekend because of heat indices that probably will hover just below or surpass 100. WDIV: Heat wave leaves farm animals with little food This kind of heat is nowhere near normal for this time of year, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said, pointing to a statement from the National Weather Service that said all but one of the 52 record-high temperatures reached in 2012 have come in the past seven days. This month, 21 high-temperature records have been set, and 30 have been tied, according to Greg Carbin, warning coordination meteorologist for the Storm Prediction Center. That's on top of 45 records set or tied in June 2011, Carbin said. The conditions have people young and old doing whatever they can to beat the heat. Among them was a 2-year-old named Kayden who spread his arms wide and made a dash for the center of Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park fountain on Friday afternoon. The fountain, which is usually crowded with children and their parents during the summer months, had been cleared for a midafternoon water show featuring the song "Under the Sea." But Kayden didn't care. It was hot, and the water looked good. His mother, 21-year-old Domonique Pagan, is from Boston and said that after seven years in Georgia, she still isn't accustomed to such heat. "Are you kidding?" she said. "I'm about to die out here. I'll never get used to this." CNN's Nick Valencia, Melissa Abbey and Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.
What level of privacy will we have online in the future? Will people share their personal data freely in exchange for more customized service? Or will they become fiercely protective of private information, using tools and browsers that protect their identity from advertisers and other third parties? Privacy experts from Facebook, Google, Mozilla and Microsoft have been tackling these big questions this week at the RSA security conference in San Francisco. Public changes to privacy policies, like the ones that make news when Facebook or Google change their settings, are just a small part of the story. Behind the scenes, these companies have full-time staffs of privacy experts, lawyers and engineers who are juggling an array of privacy demands. In addition to what the users expect, there are government regulations, industry standards and rules that vary across operating systems. Companies that provide free services, such as search engines or social networks, have to strike the right balance between respecting their customers' privacy concerns and serving advertisers. "It's important and easy for everyone to acknowledge that much of the incredible growth of the Internet today has been fueled by advertising," said Keith Enright, Google's senior privacy counsel. "I believe that will continue to be true." For Web titans, the money still flows in from advertisers, not consumers. Facebook made $4.2 billion, or 84% of its revenue, from online advertising in 2012. Google saw $43.6 billion in advertising last year, accounting for almost 95% of the company's revenue. Customers' leverage They may not be paying for the services directly, but customers still have a lot of power -- and companies know that they need to listen. People can switch to another browser, ditch Facebook and go back to writing e-mails, stop Googling and start Binging. And privacy is becoming more and more important to them. "Privacy is increasingly becoming a feature," said Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's chief privacy officer. The customer demand for stronger data controls led to the introduction of the "do not track" feature. "Do not track" is a setting that can be now found on all the major browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari. When turned on, it asks sites not to track that person's online activities. A Microsoft survey found that 75% of people were concerned about online tracking and thought the setting should be turned on by default. "Do not track" seems like a clear, smart option to give consumers, but it has has been difficult to enforce. There are talks under way by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international organization that develops standards for the Web, to make it official. However, advertisers and other third parties are pushing back. Changes to consumers' data, like "do not track," can come at the expense of advertisers, creating friction. When Mozilla recently announced that it was testing a feature that disabled third-party cookies by default in its Firefox browser, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau called it "a nuclear first strike" against the ad industry on Twitter. "We can't just sit back and allow the industry to just continue to ignore a core component of the user experience online," said Alex Fowler, Mozilla's global privacy and public policy leader. The issues will become only more complex in the future, when small sensors and devices that can track things like location, fitness and environment become ubiquitous. The more devices that connect to the Internet, from smart cars to home thermostats, the more data there are about a person to collect. Location data are already being tagged on to photos, tweets and other online actions when people use their mobile phones. For many people, they are considered private data, whether they show where someone is at that exact moment or where they've been over time. "How can you take the data, make it less sensitive but still make it of value to the user?" asked Lynch. Balancing privacy and usefulness According to the panelists, personal data such as location have many potentially positive uses, for individuals as well as advertisers. Consider the wealth of location-based tools already in use, such as food recommendations, social apps and dating services. There will probably be future options that strike a balance between sharing information and cutting off all data. Not everyone will want the same level of privacy, so options and customization will have to be made available. People could share their location information on a case-by-case basis but still stay anonymous. They might choose to have a persistent anonymous ID for location-based services, so that their location history and other data can be used without connecting them to a specific person. It's also possible that over the next five to 10 years, people's attitudes toward privacy and their data will change, and they'll be willing to share more personal information, attached to their real-world identity, in exchange for more heavily customized computing experiences. "You don't want to punish the user who cares about privacy by saying, 'Give it up or don't participate,' " Fowler said. For the people who don't want to share at all, one option floated at the panel was to charge for the services and jettison the ads. This kind of either/or option is popping up in the mobile-app world and with services like Pandora. Free versions come with ads, but for a price, people can upgrade to the ad-free experience. A paid subscription option is unlikely to come to the big services people are used to getting for free, such as Facebook. Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said that one of the chief requests from users is that the company never charge for the service. The lengthy privacy policies, thick with legalese, that most services use now will never go away, but better controls will probably emerge. Whatever the tools are used to protect and collect personal data in the future, it will be important for companies like Facebook and Google to educate their consumers and to provide them with options for all levels of privacy.
A 24-year-old Australian man was gored in the thigh Friday, the second day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. At least three other runners went to hospital with injuries, officials said. The Australian man was gored in the bullring at the end of the course. One bull became separated from the pack and came last, and alone, to the bull ring. Television images showed the man coming up behind the lone bull, which then turned on the man, who suddenly slipped and fell to the ground. He was then gored in the thigh. He was immediately tended to the bullring medical staff. A hospital report on all the injured is due later. Four runners went to the hospital with injuries Thursday on the first day of the running of the bulls. Commentators on Spanish state television TVE considered it a relatively safe start to the dangerous annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied thousands of injuries and 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man in 2009. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book "The Sun Also Rises," also published under the title "Fiesta." It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which pays Pamplona for exclusive rights, and positions some 20 cameras along the course. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). It is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the nonstop fiesta.
A plane carrying Michelle Obama had to abort its landing on Monday after it came too close to a military C-17 cargo plane ahead of it, according to a senior administration official and the Federal Aviation Administration. The planes -- which were both trying to land -- were three miles apart, when they are supposed to be five miles apart, the official told CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating what went wrong, as it is believed to be an air traffic controller mistake, the official said. The White House does not believe the first lady's life was ever in danger, the senior official said. The FAA said in a statement controllers at Andrews Air Force Base instructed an incoming Boeing 737 to perform a "go around" "because the plane did not have the required amount of separation" behind the military plane. Air traffic controller caught watching movie on duty The FAA is investigating. "The aircraft were never in any danger," the agency said. The landing was briefly aborted and Obama's plane had to circle, the official said. Obama was actually on a C-40, a military version of the 737 that was part of the Air National Guard -- not the regular Air Force fleet used by VIPs at Andrews, said Maj. Michelle Lai of the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base. What it's like to be an air traffic controller The FAA did not want Obama's plane to be caught in the "jet wash," of the C-17 as it landed, Lai said. That refers to the force of the air from the back of the C-17. "It's important to know the FAA made the right call and at no time was the first lady's life in danger," Lai said. When the Potomac TRACON, the regional radar facility, handed off the plane to the Andrews Air Force Base tower, the planes were three miles apart, a government official told CNN. "Both facilities knew how far apart they were" at the time of the handoff, the official said. But the official declined to say why the hand-off occurred. Plane clipped by tractor-trailer at Boston airport The TRACON could have slowed Obama's plane down or order it to turn earlier, the official said. Why that wasn't done is under investigation. But "it was a controlled situation," the government official said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was gathering information on the incident and will be making an assessment to determine whether it will investigate more closely. CNN's Ed Henry, Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.
Chelsea continued to set the pace in the English Premier League with a comfortable 4-1 win over Norwich City at Stamford Bridge Saturday. Norwich took an unlikely 11th minute lead through their star striker Grant Holt, but it was to prove short lived once the west London side got into their stride. Goals from Fernando Torres, his 99th in English football, Frank Lampard and Eden Hazard put them 3-1 ahead by half time. Branislav Ivanovic rounded off the scoring with an emphatic fourth in the 78th minute. Both John Terry and Ashley Cole played and were given a warm reception by the home crowd. Cole was forced to apologize Friday for a controversial Twitter comment as he reacted to the findings of an FA commission into the racial slur case brought against Terry. The commission found Terry's evidence at the hearing "improbable, implausible and contrived" as they gave the reasons for his four-match ban and large fine for remarks aimed at QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in an EPL game last season. He has until October 18 to appeal the decision or accept a ban which would rule him out of crucial games. Manager Roberto Di Matteo confirmed after the game that Cole was likely to face action from the club over his tweet. "We've got a social media policy at the club and there's going to be a disciplinary process against the tweet and that's how I'll leave it," Di Matteo said. Chelsea have opened up a four-point lead over defendiing champions Manchester City, while Norwich are winless in the league this season. Earlier Saturday, City accounted for Sunderland 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium, set on their way by a first half strike from Aleksandar Kolarov. But with the visitors showing signs of getting back into the match, manager Roberto Mancini substituted Mario Balotelli, who looked disgruntled, with Sergio Aguero. The hero of City's last-gasp title success did not take long to make his mark, connecting with a cross to make it 2-0. James Milner added a late goal for City, who were held 1-1 in midweek in the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund and were winning for just the second time in seven games in all competitions. In the late kickoff, Arsenal stepped up their challenge with a 3-1 win at West Ham. Mohamed Diame gave West Ham the first half lead but French striker Olivier Giroud scored to level just before halftime for the Gunners. Theo Walcott came on to put Arsenal ahead in the second half before Santi Cazorla completed the win late on to lift his side into fifth place.
Orbital Sciences Corp. sent up its first entry into the space freight business Wednesday with the launch of a new unmanned cargo carrier to the International Space Station. It's the first flight for the company's Cygnus spacecraft and the second for its Antares booster rocket. Liftoff was at 10:58 a.m. at NASA's launch facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, about 90 miles north of Norfolk. About 10 minutes after launch, a cheer went up in the company's flight control room in Dulles, Virginia, outside Washington, when the craft separated from the second stage of the booster. Its solar arrays deployed successfully about 15 minutes later. "The spacecraft is working really well right now," Frank Culbertson, the head of Orbital's advanced programs group and a former astronaut, told reporters after the launch. Cygnus is slated to perform three days of tests before being cleared to approach the ISS and it's scheduled to rendezvous with the space station until Sunday. The launch had been scheduled for Tuesday, but was postponed for a day because of bad weather and a technical glitch that delayed the craft's roll-out on Friday, NASA said. Unlike the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which is designed to be reused and eventually carry passengers, the can-shaped, 17-foot Cygnus is a one-shot craft that will burn up on re-entry after its flight to the space station. It carried about 1,500 pounds of cargo into orbit on Wednesday, but is capable of carrying up to 4,400 pounds (2,000 kilos), the company says. After about a month, the craft will be packed with trash from the station and cut loose to burn up in the atmosphere, Culbertson said. "It's going to be an exciting and fascinating and interesting time for everybody involved," he said. NASA hired Orbital and SpaceX to start making cargo runs to the space station after retiring its fleet of space shuttles and turning much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system. Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract with NASA to make eight flights to the space station under the space agency's commercial supply program. "We look forward to the rendezvous with the station on Sunday, and with that we'll have Orbital joining SpaceX as one of our providers," NASA Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot said. SpaceX has so far made two of its 12 scheduled flights to the ISS under a $1.6 billion contract.
U.S. President Barack Obama started his second day in India on a lighter note: pulling a few dance moves and celebrating a major religious festival with local students. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama spent Sunday morning at a local school, where students were celebrating Diwali. Youngsters performed dances in colorful saris to mark the festival of lights. The president bobbed his head to the music and clapped. Young girls danced with baskets on their heads as the room erupted in cheers. At one point, students pulled the first lady on stage and taught her how to twirl. "Notice they didn't ask me," the president said. Students later extended the offer to the president, who joined them and towered over the youngsters as he danced. Obama also visited students at Holy Name High School, where students in school uniforms explained their projects to the president. One girl described her "eco-friendly village" with a large windmill. "Did you guys get that -- a tree a day keeps global warming away," Obama told journalists. Obama also attended an agriculture exposition and took part in a town hall-style meeting with students at St. Xavier's College in Mumbai. He and the first lady then visited Humayun's Tomb, a magnificent architectural precursor to the Taj Mahal, before heading to New Delhi for a private dinner Sunday night with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. At the meeting with the students, Obama faced some difficult questions including his thoughts about jihad and why the United States doesn't consider Pakistan -- India's neighbor and rival -- a terrorist state. The president said it was necessary to isolate those who distort religion as a means for war, and said young people have a role in rejecting violence as a way to mediate differences. On Pakistan, Obama called it a country of enormous potential that had extremist elements. He acknowledged that progress against militants there was "not as quick as we'd like," particularly in the difficult terrain of the northwest territories along the border with Afghanistan. Obama also said that India has the biggest stake in its neighbor's success, and that he hoped over time that the two nations develop further trust and cooperation. "The United States stands to be a partner in that process, but can't impose that," Obama said. The relatively light agenda on the second day of Obama's 10-day, four-nation Asian trip followed the president's unveiling Saturday of about $10 billion in contracts for U.S. exports to India. "The United States sees Asia, and especially India, as a market of the future," Obama said at a meeting with business leaders from both countries. "For America, this is a jobs strategy." Promoting broader trade relations with India is a delicate balancing act for Obama, given American frustration with the outsourcing of jobs to call centers in the country. But Obama said the notion of Indian outsourcing being a net drain on the U.S. economy is part of a "caricature of India as a land of call centers and back offices that cost American jobs." Obama's three-day visit to India, Asia's third largest economy and one of the world's few growth markets, also will include bilateral talks with Singh and an address to the the nation's parliament. After India, Obama will travel to Indonesia, then on to the G-20 meeting in South Korea and APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit in Japan.
Sir Elton John and David Furnish are now husband and husband. The two married Sunday in Britain, where same-sex marriage became legal earlier this year.

The two men invited people all over the world to join them for the ceremony via Elton John's brand new Instagram feed. .
If LeRoy Carhart's abortion clinic had a terror alert scale, it would be at Code Red this weekend. Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska. "I feel safer on an airplane than I do in my clinic," Carhart said, sitting at his desk in his windowless office in Bellevue, Nebraska. "You try to think about every way an attack could happen. You try to do all you can to prevent it, but obviously Dr. [George] Tiller thought he was safe in church." It's been nearly three months since Tiller, one of the world's most well-known doctors performing abortions, was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. Anti-abortion groups, led by Operation Rescue, plan to launch protests outside Carhart's clinic this weekend in Bellevue, just south of Omaha. They will be the first major anti-abortion protests since the Tiller killing. The demonstrations are set to culminate Saturday with so-called Truth Trucks -- delivery trucks with giant rolling billboards of dismembered fetuses on the sides -- parking outside Carhart's clinic and canvassing area neighborhoods. Protesters carrying anti-abortion signs also are expected. Operation Rescue President Troy Newman has vowed a peaceful demonstration and said that any hints of possible violence are ginned up by what he calls left-wing groups and the liberal media. His group scaled down plans to protest at Carhart's facility Friday when it learned women's rights groups, including the National Organization for Women, would be there. Operation Rescue will hold a rally at a church instead Friday. "Operation Rescue has said Dr. Carhart is the next target ...," said Katherine Spillar, executive vice president with the Feminist Majority Foundation. "We fear that these kinds of activities can eventually erupt in violence, and I urge the community to make sure violence doesn't happen." Abortion rights supporters were predominant in the 50 to 75 people gathered outside the clinic Friday morning. "Welcome, welcome, this clinic stays open," some shouted when cars pulled into the clinic's driveway. Newman said earlier, "I'm not interested in putting our folks in any situation where the other side might flare up. I'm very confident about our side. They're very peaceful moms and dads and families that will be showing up with signs." He said he abhorred the killing of Tiller. "Shooting someone in the head in a church," he said, "is not a pro-life act. Sorry, it doesn't qualify." Scott Roeder, a 51-year-old anti-abortion activist, is charged in Tiller's killing. He has pleaded not guilty. Newman said he wants Carhart shut down -- through legal means. He said he was confident his organization would have shut down Tiller this summer through a legal battle. "I vehemently disagreed with what Mr. Tiller did, as well as all abortionists for what they do. But they're still human beings, and they deserve due process," Newman said. Tiller was one of about a dozen U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions. In the wake of his death, his family decided to close his clinic permanently. Carhart was a close friend and understudy of Tiller's. He performed abortions at Tiller's clinic for a week every month, including late-term procedures. Carhart has vowed to open an office in Kansas and said he'll keep doing abortions as long as he's healthy. He said he's performed more than 60,000 abortions in the past two decades. About 400 of those were after 24 weeks, he said. Staring across the room at a poster of Tiller, he said, "I don't want his death to be in vain. He spent his whole life trying to ensure better health care for women." Carhart was performing an abortion in his clinic when Tiller was killed that Sunday morning. He learned of the news by phone from Tiller's head nurse. "That's when she told me that George had been shot in church and that he was dead." Carhart is unlike many abortion doctors. He's doesn't parse his words about his profession. The outside of his office has the name of his clinic in bold letters: Abortion & Contraception Clinic of Nebraska. He said he takes pride in the term abortionist. "I do abortions, and that is what I do," he said. On Friday, Carhart teared up when talking about the abortion rights supporters outside his clinic. "It's unbelievable," he said of the support. Mark Gietzen, the driver of a truck for Operation Rescue, beamed with pride ahead of the protests. He stood outside his truck in Wichita adorned with a poster showing the dismembered hand of a fetus on a quarter. Across the top of the van, it reads, "Abortion is an ObamaNation.com." He said he knew Tiller "quite well" from the vantage point of a peaceful common enemy over the years and said the killing was a setback for "pro-lifers." He's only had one encounter with Carhart -- when the doctor drove his car by protesters and "quacked like a duck." Carhart acknowledges he might've done that. Gietzen's message to Carhart: "Please respect the life of the babies. Stop the killing, stop committing such a horrible act for money." Newman, the head of Operation Rescue, said he'll keep praying Carhart "turns back to the healing arts and not taking babies' lives." Carhart remains unmoved. "When they're ready to accept our position, then we'll sit down. We say choice is right. If you don't want to have an abortion, don't have one." Here in America's heartland, a battle is being waged and both sides are entrenched. There is no middle ground.
A U.S. Army sergeant was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole for gunning down five fellow service members at a combat stress clinic in Iraq. The sentence handed down at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington, came after Sgt. John Russell pleaded guilty to the killings in a deal in which prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. Russell pleaded guilty to the May 11, 2009, killings at Baghdad's Camp Liberty, telling a military court last month that he "did it out of rage." The only question facing the judge, Col. David Conn, was whether Russell committed the slayings with premeditation, which the 48-year-old soldier disputed. During a brief sentencing hearing, Conn ruled Russell killed with premeditation," meaning the sergeant could not be given a lesser sentence. As part of last month's plea agreement, Russell described to the court how he killed Navy Cmdr. Charles Springle, Army Maj. Matthew Houseal, Sgt. Christian Bueno-Galdos, Spec. Jacob Barton and Pfc. Michael Yates Jr. It was the first time Russell had publicly detailed what happened at the clinic. Russell, a communications specialist, was on his third deployment to Iraq. His attorneys argued Russell suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and a brain injury from previous combat, which make him not fully responsible for the killings. As part of the sentence, Russell was reduced in rank to a private and ordered dishonorably discharged from the Army, Maj. Barbara Junius, a military spokeswoman, said.

German football is riding the crest of a triumphant wave with two Bundesliga teams in the Champions League final and the national side one of the favorites for the 2014 World Cup. In contrast, no clubs from the English Premier League -- the world's richest -- made it past the last 16 knockout stage and the English national side continues to under perform at the highest level. Owen Hargreaves, who played in both the Bundesliga and the English Premier League as well as starring for England at the 2006 World Cup, believes that the English game urgently needs to start investing in young talent, or risk falling even further behind. "Young players need to play, end of," he told CNN. "There is a real lack of opportunities for young talent in the Premier League and it needs to be addressed." Born in Canada, but with a Welsh mother and English father, Hargreaves nurtured his talents in the German system with the Bayern youth set-up. He went on to win four Bundesliga titles with the Bavarian giants as well as the Champions League in the 2000-2001 season. But Hargreaves admits that during that time German football, particularly at national level, was itself suffering from a lack of youngsters to replace aging stars. And he pays credit to the German national football association and Bundesliga clubs in coming up with a plan to address that problem. "They put an emphasis on pushing young players through," added Hargreaves. "You can see the result, the Bundesliga improved, the national team improved and it's a lesson for the English Premier League." The Bayern Munich squad which so comprehensively demolished Barcelona 7-0 on aggregate in the Champions League is packed full of their youth academy protegees. Thomas Mueller, who headed the final goal of the tie, exciting 20-year-old David Alaba, rampaging full-back Philipp Lahm, midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos, all came through that route. Defender Holger Badstuber, injured earlier this year, is also a first-team regular who started his career in the academy. Borussia Dortmund, who stand between Bayern and a fifth Champions League crown, have also invested heavily in young players under the inspirational leadership of coach Juergen Klopp. "He's done an incredible job," said Hargreaves. The two jewels in their crown are acknowledged to be midfielder Mario Goetze -- who will move to Bayern at the end of the season -- and forward Marco Reus, both products of their academy set-up and tipped for stardom at international level. Defender Mats Hummels ironically learned his trade with Bayern before switching to Dortmund to get regular first-team action. They have all played a prominent role in thrilling successive victories over Spanish clubs Malaga and then Real Madrid in the semifinal to reach the Wembley showpiece on May 25. Hargreaves is full of admiration for the ethos of style of play of the two German finalists. "They combine Germany efficiency now with flair," he said. "They are mirror images of each other and both thoroughly deserve to reach the final." Hargreaves moved to Manchester United and was an integral part of the 2007-08 side which won the Premier League title and Champions League, but injuries blighted his career after that double triumph and he was forced to retire at the end of last season aged 32. During his spell in the English Premier League, which ended at big money Manchester City, he saw at first hand the trend towards clubs using ever more foreign imports to supplement their ranks. He acknowledges that with the big money on offer, the stakes are high. "Maybe clubs are frightened to give home grown talent a chance," he said. England manager Roy Hodgson has also seen the danger signs as his side make hard work of qualifying for next year's World Cup in Brazil. "Quite a few of the games I go to do not have any English players," he was quoted as telling the Daily Telegraph. "So, one has to be very careful these days when talking about the Premier League and talking about the Englishness of it, because more than two thirds of the players in the league are not English. "We have one of the lowest number of home-grown players to choose from in all the leagues, which, if you are national team manager, is not a great advantage, to be frank." In the Bundesliga, the figures for German talent getting a regular game are the polar opposite to the English Premier League, with participation at well over 60% and it's the same percentage in Spain, the reigning World Cup and European champions. Barcelona's famed La Masia academy nurtured the genius of Argentina's Lionel Messi and midfield maestros Xavi and Andres Iniesta, who have been the corner stone of Spain's international success. On the evidence of the 7-0 semifinal mauling by a rampant Bayern, Barca may need to replenish their ranks with younger talent, with Thiago Alcantara and Cristian Tello pushing to graduate to regular first team play. In England, there are signs that the principles Hargreaves and so many others espouse may finally be incorporated into the national game. The Premier League has introduced rules that mean eight of the 25-man squads must be "home grown" talent, limiting the number of foreign players over 21 to a maximum of 17. The Premier League also has high hopes for its Elite Player Performance Plan, which is designed to increase the number of home grown players playing football at the highest level. While this does not mean the English youngsters will get a starting place, it does broaden opportunity and the English Football Association (FA) has also built a new National Center of Excellence in St George's Park in the Midlands. For Hargreaves it cannot come a moment too soon and his former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville, now an assistant coach to Hodgson, has also seen the danger signs. "There's a tipping point and I think we've gone beyond it in England. We're maybe 20 per cent off. We need to give more chances to our own. We're harming ourselves a little bit." he was quoted recently. Prime target Ironically, the rising star of the Premier League is a Welshman, Gareth Bale, who won the young player and player of the year awards for his incredible performances this season for Tottenham Hotspur. Bale was developed by Southampton's academy, which also produced Arsenal and England striker Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain -- proof that young talent can thrive in Premier League if given a chance. Hodgson and Neville must be ruing the fact they cannot pair former teammates Bale, Walcott and Oxlade-Chamberlain in the England line-up, while Tottenham will be anxious their star asset remains at White Hart Lane. After Barcelona and Real Madrid's maulings at the hands of the all-conquering German sides they are rumored to be looking to supplement their own home grown Spanish stars with big money signings and Bale is reportedly a prime target. Bayern, with former Barca coach Pep Guardiola taking over from Jupp Heynckes next season, are also not adverse to using their financial muscle as well. Dortmund's talisman Goetze is switching to the Allianz Arena next season -- making it even harder for sides from the EPL and other major European leagues to challenge a likely new era of German domination.
South Korean marines detained an American man on the bank of a river bordering North Korea late Tuesday, according to a South Korean Defense Ministry official and a senior U.S. State Department official. The marines were on a regular patrol mission west of Seoul when they caught the man by the Han River in an area where it divides North and South Korea. The U.S. citizen was being interrogated Wednesday, the defense ministry official said, adding that it was not immediately known whether the American was trying to cross into North Korea. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul said it was "aware of the reports that a U.S. citizen has been detained attempting to swim from South Korea to North Korea." The Embassy said it had been in contact with South Korean authorities but didn't have any additional information to share. Americans are allowed to travel to North Korea, usually arriving by plane from Beijing. But it's forbidden to cross from South Korea into North Korea. The U.S. State Department warns citizens against all travel to the authoritarian state led by Kim Jong Un. Three U.S. citizens are currently in detention in North Korea: Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Fowle. A North Korean court on Sunday sentenced Miller to six years hard labor for committing "acts hostile" to North Korea, although the circumstances surrounding his alleged crime remain murky. Bae, a Korean-American missionary, is serving a 15-year sentence for allegedly trying to bring down the North Korean government. Fowle, who was arrested in June while traveling as a tourist, is still awaiting trial. Fast facts on detained Americans CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong. CNN's Paula Hancocks, Elise Labott and Josh Levs contributed to this report.
In the age of digital audio, what does good old-fashioned radio still have to offer? Teca Lima, the voice of RadarCultura, consults the Web site before talking into the mic. Plenty, according to the creators of RadarCultura, a community-based Web site and a daily three-hour AM radio program broadcast from Brazil's São Paulo. "Radio is 'now,'" says 22-year-old Brazilian André Avorio, who implemented the Web site. "[Radio] is generally quick and live. This adds a special dynamic to the medium. Moreover, it is still one of the most popular means of mass communication in Brazil. Combining it with the power of the Internet can result in many new possibilities." RadarCultura is an experimental project of the Padre Anchieta Foundation to promote public participation in audio-visual programming, eventually aiming to fuse its radio, television and Web programs into a single interactive, real-time platform. Like many online music sites, RadarCultura is always looking for new music and emerging talents, but its primary focus is to preserve the memory of the Brazilian repertoire by resurfacing classic, forgotten or unknown songs. The Padre Anchieta Foundation also happens to boast the biggest archive of Brazilian music in Brazil, including more than 15,000 songs dating from the 1920's to the present. "Making it easy to search through the vast archive of songs was an important feature since version one of the Web site," says Avorio. Producer Alceu Maynard observes two types of RadarCultura members: "There are people who listen to the show because they are fans of Brazilian music. There are others who like to produce the content on our site -- they collaborate actively with suggestions, playlists and all aspects of programming." Meanwhile, RadarCultura team members Alceu, speaker Teca Lima and project manager Lia Rangel are busy podcasting interviews, moderating conversations, blogging, twittering and keeping the site relevant. Old media gets new blood True to its non-visual origin, RadarCultura's Web site is strictly text-based, with icons that link to votes and streaming audio. And true to its Web-based platform, the site has adopted, and adapted, all Net-native systems for its daily operations. The site itself runs on the free Drupal content-management system, which allows content to rank and flow according to input and feedback from the site's online community. Members who wish to contribute their own audio material to RadarCultura's archive must either podcast it themselves first, or else they may upload it to the U.S.-based Archive.org to clear it of online rights. Given the quantity of music aired from the ever-expanding repertoire, copyright issues are the most common pretext to negotiation, most notably with ECAD, a privately owned civil society for the collection and distribution of copyright managed by 10 Brazilian music associations. Online, however, RadarCultura distributes the entirety of its streaming content under a Creative Commons license. The team has also been experimenting with the free CoveritLive software to enable live blogging, chatting and Twittering among audience, presenters and guests during its online coverage of radio and TV events, including the popular Roda Vivo TV show. RadarCultura's first live event coverage in February 2008 was of Campus Party Brasil, a seven-day tech-fest that saw people camping out in tents with broadband cables while sharing ideas and technological innovations. In April 2008, RadarCultura struck again with its live coverage of Virada Cultural, Brazil's largest cultural event, including art performances and exhibits in the streets of São Paulo during 24 continuous hours, attracting some 4 million people. "I came up with the idea of inviting the audience to report directly from the streets using their mobile phones," says Avorio. "A telephone system was installed, and the calls from the participants were automatically recorded. Our non-stop production team listened to every recording as they arrived and not only immediately published them online but geo-localized them on an interactive map of São Paulo. "It was RadarCultura's first truly collaborative coverage, as the audience produced most of the interviews and reviews, of not only the main attractions of Virada Cultural, but also the very obscure ones that otherwise would not be covered by the mainstream media." Next: Music for the masses, on demand But still much remains to be done with RadarCultura's original content -- music. "Due to legal restrictions, it has been very difficult to exploit many of the possibilities previously imagined for the RadarCultura Web site, like listening online to playlists or to the thousands of songs in the archive," Avorio reflects. "Live radio has been a great success and will remain so for a long time, but it is now clear the value of on-demand content -- whenever you want it, wherever you are, on whatever device you have handy -- from the iPod to your mobile phone." RadarCultura's Web site not only introduces Brazilian music and culture to the international online community, it brings its programming well beyond the limited broadcasting range of the station's native São Paulo to the rest of Brazil. In a nation notorious for violence rooted in social inequality, the democracy of the Web -- not unlike radio -- is a welcome new medium of communication. "Certainly São Paulo is the most 'wired' city in the country, but the Internet and the possibilities associated with it have reached the most distant towns," says Avorio. "It is amazing the value that such a technology delivers to a country in a fast development pace such as Brazil -- from education to more subtle ways of social inclusion." For Gioconda Bordon, Padre Anchieta Foundation's radio coordinator, RadarCultura's most memorable moment took place on December 17, 2008, when the program celebrated its first anniversary. "We had here in our studio the great composer Tom Zé, a very well-known musician, singing and talking live with a very young singer, Mallu Magalhães, a teenager, actually," she recalls. "The listeners were as happy as we were and, of course, as moved as the two artists were. It was a day in our history."
A new policy sets guidelines for how long U.S. border officials can hold computers and downloaded information seized at checkpoints, and with whom they can share that information. New rules announced Thursday specify border searches to be conducted "as expeditiously as possible." The policy, announced Thursday by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, continues to give border officials the authority to search files in travelers' laptop computers, mobile phones, Blackberrys and similar devices with or without suspicion that a crime has occurred. That is in keeping with long-standing court rulings that say the federal government's powers of search and seizure are greatest at the border to protect the country. But the new policy also attempts to address complaints from travelers that border officials are needlessly perusing confidential information, downloading it and keeping devices and information indefinitely without any explanation. The policy gives travelers the right to be "present in the room" during searches, although they are "not necessarily ... permitted to witness the search itself." It says searches should be conducted "as expeditiously as possible." And Customs and Border Protection officers should keep devices no longer than five days unless there are "extenuating circumstances." Officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the investigative branch of the Homeland Security Department, can keep devices up to 30 days. It also requires border officers to document searches and conduct them in the presence of a supervisor. And it says they should take steps to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information and share it only with federal agencies "that have mechanisms in place to protect" the data. Border officers have long had to deal with issues pitting privacy versus security. But with the proliferation of laptop computers, travelers increasingly are traveling with sensitive information, including confidential legal documents, medical records, credit card and bank information and trade secrets. "Keeping Americans safe in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully screen materials entering the United States," Napolitano said in a written statement. "The new directives ... strike the balance between respecting the civil liberties and privacy of all travelers while ensuring DHS can take the lawful actions necessary to secure our borders." The American Civil Liberties Union said the new rules are a "welcome first step," but said they do not go far enough. "There are two key aspects of this new policy worth applauding -- the limitations on the time that electronic devices can be held by customs officers and requirements that information from electronic devices only be retained if there is probable cause that a crime has been committed," said ACLU attorney Christopher Calabrese. "These procedural safeguards recognize that the old system was invasive and harmed many innocent travelers." "But unless and until the government requires agents to have individualized suspicion before reviewing such sensitive information as medical records, legal papers and financial information, even the most elaborate procedural safeguards will be insufficient," he said. The ACLU this week filed suit seeking records about the Customs and Border Protection's policy of searching travelers' laptops. The Homeland Security Department's statement said its new policies "enhance transparency, accountability and oversight of electronic media searches at U.S. ports of entry." "Searches of electronic media ... are vital to detecting information that poses serious harm to the United States, including terrorist plans, or constitutes criminal activity -- such as possession of child pornography and trademark or copyright infringement," the statement said. The department said it searches electronic media "on a small percentage of international travelers." The border protection agency said that between October 1, 2008, and August 11, it conducted about 1,000 laptop searches while processing more than 221 million travelers at U.S. ports of entry. Just 46 searches were in depth, it said.

Vietnamese authorities are searching for an oil tanker feared to have been taken by pirates just 40 minutes after it departed Singapore for Vietnam almost one week ago. The Sunrise 689 was carrying 18 crew and 5,200 tonnes of oil when it left Singapore's Horizon port on October 2, according to the Vietnamese News Service (VNS). The ship's owner, the Hai Phong Seafood Shipbuilding Join Stock Company, reported that it lost contact with the ship within an hour of its departure, VNS said. VNS reported that Vietnam's Foreign Ministry had sent "diplomatic notes" to the embassies of Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia in Hanoi, asking for assistance in finding the missing ship. Piracy rising in Asia Southeast Asia has become a prime target for pirates who have staged a number "serious attacks" on tankers in the region, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). According to a report released in July, there had been at least six known hijackings since April, when small coastal tankers were targeted for their cargo of diesel or gas oil. "The recent increase in the number of successful hijackings is a cause for concern," IMB director Pottengal Mukundanm said at the time. Until this year, most attacks had been petty thefts perpetrated on boats anchored at harbor, the IMB said. The missing ship, Sunrise 689, was last detected in the middle of a busy shipping zone in the Singapore Strait. According to warnings issued by the IMB, vessels in the Singapore Strait are advised to "remain vigilant and to continue maintaining adequate anti-piracy / robbery watch and measures. Pirates / robbers attack ships while underway or while at anchor especially during the night." Sunrise 689 had been expected to arrive at Con Son island in southern Vietnam on Sunday, October 5, VNS said.
Piracy is expected to pick up in the high seas off Somalia after a lull caused by monsoon season, maritime officials warned Monday. Suspected Somali pirates sit behind bars during the first hearing in their trial at Aden port court on July 15. The Combined Maritime Forces urged crews to take up safety measures, including using recognized transit corridors in the Gulf of Aden and reporting to the European Union's security center before transit. "The prior preparation and vigilance of merchant mariners at all times of day and night is more important now than ever," said Rear Admiral Caner Bener of the Combined Task Force. International forces made up of more than 30 ships and aircraft from 16 nations will continue patrolling the waters to help fight pirates, according to officials. "While our ability to deter and disrupt attacks has improved over time, we are constantly adapting the way we do our business as the pirates adapt and modify their tactics," Bener said. The waters off Somalia are rife with pirate activity, despite increased measures by military forces and shipping companies to ward off attacks. Heavily armed pirates have struck the busy Indian Ocean shipping lanes and the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. They have captured dozens of vessels and hundreds of hostages, making off with millions of dollars in ransom. It was unclear whether a ransom was paid. The Gulf of Aden, off northern Somalia, has the highest risk of piracy in the world.
Former NBA star Allen Iverson launched an expletive-ridden tirade against police when a car belonging to him was pulled over for a traffic violation last week, at one point telling the officer, "Take the vehicle, I have 10 more," according to a police report. Iverson, 35, was a passenger in a grey Lamborghini, spied by an Atlanta officer changing lanes without signaling about 6 p.m. on March 30, according to the police report obtained by CNN. The driver, identified in the report as Antwuan Clisby, couldn't produce any documentation for the vehicle, the report said. He then told the officer his passenger needed to leave the vehicle to eat dinner, and the officer said no one was leaving until the investigation was complete. With that, Iverson became "irate," according to the police report, saying, "I'm the (expletive) passenger." The officer radioed for backup, and a second unit arrived, according to the report. Clisby and Iverson were asked to exit the vehicle, while Iverson continued to curse at the officer, the report said. When police scanned the identification number of the vehicle, which belongs to Iverson, it was found to have tags that expired in 2009. Iverson, former MVP for the Philadelphia 76ers, was told his car would be towed. "Take the vehicle, I have 10 more," Iverson said, according to the report. "Police don't have anything else (expletive) to do except (expletive) with me." He then asked, "Do you know who I am?" The officer wrote in his report that "For the next 20 minutes, Mr. Iverson went on and on about who he was. I stated to Mr. Iverson, 'It really doesn't matter who you are. You tried to conceal your vehicle with a fake drive-out tag due to you not paying for your tags.' " Find out why LeBron James' mother was arrested in Miami Iverson then said, "I make more money than you will in 10 years," according to the report. Clisby, the driver, asked the officers, "Would you want to pay $10,000 for a tag?" the report said. The car was towed, and Iverson later "came back and apologized for disrespecting the police," according to the police report. "He stated he was just upset about his car." Clisby was cited for failure to signal while changing lanes and the expired tag, the report said.
As protests continue over the disputed presidential elections in Iran, we asked two analysts to explain the background to the controversy. Supporters of President Ahmadinejad wave flags at a massive rally in Tehran Sunday to celebrate his victory. Q) What degree of election monitoring is there in Iran? A) The problem with this election, according to London-based Mideast analyst Amir Taheri, is that there is no independent monitoring at all in Iran with the interior ministry arguing that the Council of the Guardians of the Constitution, a "star chamber" of 12 mullahs, would have that role. "Candidates are not allowed to be present at polling stations during voting or counting. Many voters are illiterate and officials help them fill in their ballot papers, so the possibilities for rigging are immense. And there are no booths in the polling stations so voting is done in public, not in private -- a major obstacle for transparency," Taheri said. So the problem for opposition candidates in this election, said Taheri, the author of "The Persian Night," is that there are no concrete examples of fraud because there was no monitoring. "You could say all of Iran's 10 presidential elections have been fraudulent or that all were fair -- we just don't know. All have been held in the same way. The whole electoral process from the vetting of candidates to voting and ballot counting is conducted by the state." Q) So is it possible that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did win the election? A) The president does indeed have great public support in Iran, Taheri said, adding that "I'm sure he did win the election but it's impossible he won 63 percent of the vote. The results probably exaggerated the scale of his support." According to official results, Ahmadinejad won in all regions and among all classes and ages -- again, something that Taheri said was unlikely, "but I can't prove it." Had he not exaggerated the scale of his victory, Taheri said, unlike in previous presidential elections, it is possible there wouldn't be the outcry there is now. "Many Iranians feel insulted by the results because they feel their vote didn't count. Everybody knows, for instance that Ahmadinejad is unpopular in cities but he still won the vote there. That is why people are so angry." Another Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour agreed, saying he believed this was "a stolen election."  Watch Sadjadpour explain why election was "stolen" » "There are a lot of signs there were major improprieties. First of all there were 40 million votes cast and just two hours after the polls had closed they announced Ahmadinejad's victory: and these votes are hand counted in Iran... Sadjadpour, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, added: "Another example I give is that (opposition leader Mir Hossein) Moussavi, who is an ethnic Azeri Turk, lost the province of Iranian Azerbaijan. This is the equivalent of Barack Obama losing the African American vote to John McCain in 2008." Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the record voter turnout in Friday's election showed Iranians value "resistance against oppressors," the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. "Pointing to enemies' massive propaganda campaign to discourage people from taking part in the elections, Ayatollah Khamenei also said there was really a divine miracle behind this elections, given its results that was 10 million higher than any of the previous ones in the 30-year history of elections in Iran," IRNA reported. Q) Will the anger and protests on the streets subside or grow into something much greater? A) Much depends on what the opposition candidates do in coming days, according to Sadjadpour. "We've never in the 30-year history of the Islamic republic seen the revolutionary elite so divided," he said. Former centrist president Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a founding father of the Islamic republic, and Moussavi are now both opposition candidates. "They feel the election was stolen from them and that the majority of public support is on their side. They're planning more public protests so this tumult may not subside any time soon."  Gallery: Emotions run high after election » Q) How will the regime deal with these protests? A) Iran's leaders "have repression down to a science," said Sadjadpour. "Before the election they ease political and social restrictions because they want to project a democratic face to the world. But at times like these when rallies are getting out of hand they use overwhelming force to nip them in the bud. So I anticipate more use of force to ensure they don't get out of hand."  Watch report on latest violence in Iran » Q) What will the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei do? A) This is the big question and there were reports on Monday he would agree to an investigation into allegations of vote rigging. Speaking earlier, Sadjadpour said he felt the supreme leader would not intervene unless he felt his sustainability as leader was at stake. "The reason why is that I believe he was behind this power grab. Ahmadinejad was his candidate so he's not exactly an objective actor. Opposition candidates are trying to appeal to Khamenei before they take to the streets but I'm not sure how he walks back from this." Q) What does four more years of Ahmadinejad mean for Iran and the rest of the world? A) The big problem the United States and Europe is to stop Iran from going nuclear and Ahmadinejad's reelection means Iran's aggressive policy towards the West is not going to change. "I feel the results are quite disastrous," said Sadjadpour. "In terms of the U.S.-Iran relationship, Ahmadinejad's mere presence could well serve as an insurmountable obstacle to confidence building. He presses the worst buttons in the context of domestic U.S. politics with his denial of the Holocaust and belligerence towards Israel. Domestically in Iran he has profoundly mismanaged the economy with one of the highest inflation rates in the world and high unemployment." However according to TIME magazine, behind closed doors the White House may be relieved by the result. Despite the attention paid to the office of the Iranian presidency, nuclear policy is set by the country's religious leaders and appear determined to amass enriched uranium whether or not a hard-liner or a moderate is president, the magazine said Monday. "Ahmadinejad's win may increase Washington's chances of getting tougher sanctions on Iran if they refuse to negotiate," TIME reported senior Administration officials as saying.
Humble woodcutter Mohammed Sultan Nafeek's teenage daughter moved to Saudi Arabia to work as a housemaid to support her family after they were displaced by the 2004 tsunami. Now she is on death row, and all he can do is pray. Razeena Mohammad (left) and Mohammad Sultan Nafeek, parents of Rizana Nafeek. Rizana, who was 17 when she started work in Saudi Arabia, was convicted of killing a 4-month-old baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job. Nafeek says the child died accidentally, choking on milk. His daughter was sentenced to beheading in a case rights groups say underlines the vulnerability of many of the 1.5 million Sri Lankans who work abroad -- nearly 400,000 of them in Saudi Arabia alone. "Our family was suffering hardship, and so our daughter volunteered to go and work abroad to send money home," Nafeek told Reuters by telephone from his modest home in Mutur in Sri Lanka's war-torn northeast. After the December 2004 tsunami forced them from their home, the family was displaced again by renewed civil war between the state and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. Nafeek visited Saudi Arabia with Sri Lanka's deputy foreign minister this month in a bid to secure clemency and met with relations of the dead child's parents but came away empty handed. Under Saudi law, a pardon is the gift of the family of the victim, and so far the parents of the dead child have refused to meet either the family or Sri Lankan officials. "The cops told us: 'Go and pray to Allah. If you can get the forgiveness of the parents, your daughter will be free,' " he said. "So I am praying all the time." "If we had been able to meet the parents, we are sure they would have been willing to forgive our daughter after seeing our situation." The Sri Lankan government is investigating the agency that sent Rizana to work abroad when she was technically still a child but remains hopeful she will be pardoned or exonerated. "I am fairly confident," said Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Bhaila. "We have spoken to tribal leaders of their particular tribe, we have spoken to area officials... It is they who will now have to speak (to the parents)." "His Excellency the President (Mahinda Rajapaksa) has been following this case very keenly. This is an exceptional case because of her tender age," he added. Rights groups accuse the government of failing to protect its expatriate workers -- one of the main sources of foreign-exchange revenues for the $23 billion economy -- with legal aid. They also decry Saudi Arabia's legal system. "This case raises many troubling questions about the treatment of children and foreigners in Saudi Arabia's criminal-justice system," Human Rights Watch said in a statement issued overnight. "International law prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18." Saudi Arabia executed four Sri Lankans convicted of armed robbery earlier this year, and did not inform Sri Lankan authorities beforehand. Sri Lanka reinstated its own death penalty in 2004 after the murder of a high court judge, but it has been dormant since 1976. There is no indication any of the dozens of convicted murderers, rapists and drug smugglers on death row in Sri Lanka and effectively serving life prison terms will actually be executed.

when more than 50 people cared for Duncan in a 24-bed intensive care unit set aside for his care -- the hospital said, "Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and are that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care." The hospital said: "We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area." In its Thursday statement, Texas Health Presbyterian addressed other criticisms as well. Why wasn't he immediately given an experimental drug? Because one wasn't available, the hospital explained. Why didn't he get a blood transfusion, like other Ebola patients in the United States? Because "his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors." 7 ways Thomas Eric Duncan's Ebola case differs from others in U.S. As to Duncan's condition the first time he went to Texas Health Presbyterian, the hospital said he had a "low grade fever and abdominal pain," and was released with some antibiotics and a pain reliever. Weeks claims that discharge papers show that Duncan, in fact, had a 103-degree fever when he left the hospital. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Thursday -- as he and other officials have said previously -- that "clearly there was a misstep early on when he wasn't diagnosed immediately" in that first ER visit. There have been criticisms that hospital staff didn't process the fact Duncan had come from Liberia, where Ebola has infected and killed thousands. But Fauci said that blaming the hospital for Duncan's death is "misplaced," even if it is "understandable" for a mourning family. "I just can't believe that he was deliberately treated in a less well way than others," said Fauci. It seems no explanation, no justification, will wipe away Weeks' grief for a man he called "my brother, my uncle, my best friend" as a "very good person' who would help anyone regardless of their skin color, their health condition or anything else. Wiping away tears, Weeks said that, while he's obviously upset at the Dallas hospital, he would be fine if Duncan could miraculously come back to life. "(But) he's dead. There's nothing you can do," the nephew said. "You can't bring him back ... I can't have him (back). I never will." Complete coverage on Ebola
A high school senior's racy picture is causing controversy after the yearbook staff refused to publish it, calling the picture inappropriate. The photo shows 18-year-old Sydney Spies in a short skirt and revealing top. She had it taken by a professional photographer in her hometown of Durango, Colorado, and submitted it to the yearbook with her mother's approval. "She tells me that she has grown tired of seeing all the boring pictures submitted, and she wanted to do something different," said Sydney's mother, Miki Spies. Seniors at Durango High School can submit their own photos to the yearbook. They often choose pictures that reflect their interests, like sports or music. A committee of five students determines whether the photos are acceptable. They rejected Spies' photo, calling it inappropriate. A second photo, showing her in a short dress against a brick wall, was also rejected. "There's something wrong when people can't express themselves in their own yearbook," Miki Spies said. The Durango School District says it wasn't part of the process, but it supports the decision of the yearbook committee. According to spokeswoman Marty Kay Hutton, "The student editors of Durango High School's yearbook informed a senior student in December that her photo in question would not be included as a senior portrait in the yearbook and asked her to submit a replacement. Durango School District administration supports this decision." Miki Spies says her daughter should be able to express herself, just like any other student. "There are no standards that are required for yearbook photos. She's into the arts outside of school," Miki Spies said. The photos have outraged many as the story has spread. On a Facebook page set up by the family, some of the comments are extremely negative: "Too sexy for a young woman. Think of how you will be remembered for the rest of your life, in the eyes of your classmates." "You are gross and your parents are losers like you are." "Tramp." Miki Spies says that she is surprised by the comments but that they have strengthened her resolve to fight for her daughter. She's not sure what they will do next but says she has contacted the ACLU for help. "I'm a fighter for the underdog, and I hate the abuse of authority," she said. "I'm surprised more Americans aren't on the side of freedom of expression anymore."
Thanksgiving is one of those great holidays that are less about commercialism and more about togetherness (and food, of course). Unfortunately, all that togetherness can be a little stressful for couples -- especially if it includes a hectic travel schedule and/or time with one or both sets of families. So, after the jump, eight tips for surviving the holiday as a couple. 1. If you're hosting Thanksgiving, make sure to share the work load. Whether you're hosting your friends or your families or a combination of both, the key to survival is to help each other with all the tasks at hand. That may mean splitting the duties (one of you cleans while the other one cooks), or working together to get everything on the to-do list done. This is a wonderful opportunity to support one another and work toward a common goal together. Plus, entertaining can be fun -- especially if you do it with someone you love, so enjoy the day and don't get too caught up in the idea of being "perfect." 2. If you're traveling, make a joint playlist for the road. Holiday travel is stressful enough and if there's family on the other end of your trip, you're likely feeling even more pressure than usual. So keep things a little lighter by spending an hour or so before your travel day making a joint playlist you can listen to together en route. Choose songs you both love or have special meaning to you as a couple to help you reconnect during your weekend away (or help you think of each other if you have to spend the holiday apart). The Frisky: 10 tips for throwing a family-free, friends-only Thanksgiving 3. Make time for just the two of you. If you're hosting friends or family or going away for the whole weekend, it's imperative that you squeeze in some solo time with your partner. If you're lucky enough to share a room, retire to bed a little earlier than normal or stay in bed just a little later to relish a few extra moments of alone time. Try to get out for a walk around the neighborhood, or pull your boyfriend away from the rest of the family and show him a childhood photo album. The point is to reconnect at some point during each day so you can check in with one another and you won't feel like strangers when the weekend's over and it's just the two of you again. The Frisky: The American Music Awards: the good, the bad, and the boring 4. If you're meeting new family, debrief each other on names, relationships, and topics to avoid. Thanksgiving is a time for a lot of new couples to meet each other's extended families for the first time. If you have a crazy Uncle Phil who's sometimes medicated and sometimes not, warn your girlfriend about him before you throw her into the fray. Likewise, if cousin Sue just got canned or Aunt Irene's cheatin' husband just dumped her or twins Larry and Carrie can't stand each other anymore, let your boyfriend know about these dynamics so he's not caught off-guard or with his foot in his mouth. The Frisky: The 10 most common non-negotiables 5. Start a holiday tradition you both enjoy. It can be anything -- asking your guests to bring a favorite family dish, playing charades after dinner, watching the National Dog Show, volunteering at a soup kitchen -- but incorporating at least one activity you both really enjoy and declaring it a new tradition will help you feel connected and give you something to look forward to as a couple each year. The Frisky: 10 celebs who say they "can't meet people" 6. Get your heart rates up. Thanksgiving is all about food and you're going to be stuffing your faces with a lot of it, so make sure you engage in some physical activity to burn off some of those calories -- and stress! -- and to help keep each other from sliding off the exercise wagon during the holiday weekend. A walk before or after dinner is always a good idea. The Frisky: The 10 ugliest Prince William and Kate Middleton products for sale 7. Compromise, compromise, compromise. Whether you have invites to more than one Thanksgiving get-together, you live close enough to see both sets of families, or you have to choose which family or set of friends to spend time with this year, the key to avoiding a fight and hurt feelings is to compromise. If you can only see one set of family, decide to see the other set (or sets, if you're children of divorced families) for Christmas or New Year's or Thanksgiving next year. If everyone lives close enough that you can see more than one set of family (or friends) this holiday, have lunch at one place and dinner at another, or the entreé at one home and dessert at the other. People understand -- or they should, anyway -- if you have double the social obligations and can't spend the entire day and evening at one place. The Frisky: Can ex-lovers be roomies? 8. Thank each other. This is Thanksgiving, after all, so don't forget to show your appreciation for your one and only. Whether you're grateful he's coming home with you to meet your family or you're thankful she's putting up with all the football on TV, tell your significant other often how much you appreciate him or her this Thanksgiving. It's one of those things people really can't hear enough. Especially when they're stuck between feuding Larry and Carrie at the dinner table ...

Gunmen shot and killed a food monitor for the United Nations' World Food Program on Thursday, the second killing of a WFP humanitarian worker in Somalia in three days, a spokesman for the agency said Thursday. Mohamud Omar Moallim, a food monitor for the United Nations, was killed in Somalia on Thursday, the U.N. says. Peter Smerdon said Mohamud Omar Moallim, 49, was shot by unidentified gunmen while distributing food to displaced people at Daynile, 6 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of Mogadishu. The gunmen put Moallim's body in a WFP vehicle and drove away, then pushed the corpse from the vehicle and drove on, Smerdon said. Moallim joined WFP in 1993 and worked until 1995 as a logistics assistant. He rejoined the agency in May 2006 as a food monitor. He was abducted in September 2008 for 16 hours outside Mogadishu. He leaves two wives and 11 children. Colleagues said Moallim was calm, extremely hard-working and highly responsible and was often consulted for advice and support by other staff members. On Tuesday, three masked men shot and killed 44-year-old Somali national Ibrahim Hussein Duale while he was monitoring food distribution at a school in Yubsan village, near the Gedo regional capital of Garbahare, the WFP said. Witnesses say the gunmen approached Duale while he was seated, ordered him to stand up and then shot him, according to the account on the WFP Web site. Duale leaves a wife and five children. He joined WFP in 2006 as a food monitor in the Gedo region, which borders Kenya and Ethiopia.
Facebook's iPad app could be a lot closer to launch than we thought. A full-sized, fully-functional version of the iPad app is hidden inside the current iPhone app. That means that, if you are running the iPhone app you already have the iPad executable on your phone. Discovered by M.G Siegler, Apple writer for AOL's Tech Crunch, the iPad app is a lot more modern-looking than the tired old iPhone version, and looks a lot like Twitter's official iPad app. On the left is a source list to navigate between your Wall, info, photos and friends sections. Up top, below the status bar, you'll find more icons to take you to different sections (places and chat, amongst others), and if you flip to horizontal orientation you get a combination of both these navigation "aids," and the top-bar nav icons remain. In short, Facebook has managed to fully port the signature confusion of its website to a tablet app, a not insignificant achievement. Siegler, who found the app after reading about it on Twitter, calls the app "spectacular." The discovery was made by a an engineering student named Marvin Bernal, who also gives instructions on how to get it running on your own iPad. If you are smart enough to know what that means, and yet you still use Facebook, then go ahead and hack away. The rest of us can either wait for the official launch, or wait for Google to release Google Plus for the iPad. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

Bob Dylan has signed a six-book deal with Simon & Schuster, according to Crain's New York Business, encompassing two sequels to his acclaimed 2004 book "Chronicles: Volume One" as well as another book based on dialogue from his Sirius/XM radio show "Theme Time Radio Hour." It's unclear what the other three books are going to be. According to the Crain's, Dylan's literary agent Andrew Wylie was seeking an eight-figure deal for the books. (Dylan has not responded to Rolling Stone's request for comment). RollingStone.com: Classic Bob Dylan photos from the 1960s In 2006 Dylan told Rolling Stone that he was stunned by the overwhelmingly positive response to the first volume of Chronicles. "The reviews of this book, some of 'em almost made me cry - in a good way," he told writer Jonathan Lethem. "I'd never felt that from a music critic, ever....Most people who write about music, they have no idea what it feels like to play it. But with the book I wrote, I thought, 'The people who are writing reviews of this book, man, they know what the hell they're talking about.' It spoils you." RollingStone.com: The artwork of Bob Dylan In that same article, he discussed his possible plans for "Chronicles: Volume 2." "I think I can go back to the 'Blonde on Blonde' album -- that's probably about as far back as I can go on the next book," he said. "Then I'll probably go forward. I thought of an interesting time. "I made this record, 'Under the Red Sky,' with Don Was, but at the same time I was also doing the [second] Wilburys record. I don't know how it happened that I got into both albums at the same time. "I worked with George [Harrison] and Jeff [Lynne] during the day -- everything had to be done in one day, the track and the song had to be written in one day, and then I'd go down and see Don Was, and I felt like I was walking into a wall. He'd have a different band for me to play with every day, a lot of all-stars, for no particular purpose. "Back then I wasn't bringing anything at all into the studio, I was completely disillusioned."

This story is about a U.S. senator's alleged trips on a private plane to the Caribbean for sex parties with prostitutes. If it proves to be true, it would most likely topple a powerful politician and affect President Barack Obama's ability to pass legislation. If it is false, it would raise questions about how government watchdog groups and the media handle anonymous tipsters and their information. The senator is New Jersey's Robert Menendez, a 59-year-old divorced father of two who is set to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His Senate website calls Menendez "a fighter for New Jersey families." Menendez denied the story in a statement issued Wednesday by his Senate office: "Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false." The "right-wing blog" Menendez is accusing of manufacturing the allegations is The Daily Caller, an online publication founded by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel, a former adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney. The Daily Caller published its first reports on the allegations in early November just before the election. The stories were based on interviews with two women and a Dominican Republic official -- all unidentified. That prompted a denial then by the Democratic senator. He was easily re-elected. But the latest allegations are based on documents published by a "non-partisan" Washington watchdog group -- Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, known as CREW. It would be a stretch to call CREW "right-wing," considering Executive Director Melanie Sloan served as minority counsel for the House Judiciary Committee under Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, before being hired by the Clinton Justice Department to be an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. In fact, a quick online search finds blogs accusing CREW of being a "left-wing" group. CREW published an e-mail this week it received last April from a man who identified himself as Peter Williams. "My duty as a U.S. citizen obligates me to report what I consider to be a grave violation of the most fundamental codes of conduct that a politician of my country must follow," the tipster wrote. E-mails sent by Williams included statements from women detailing what they said were sex parties in a house and on a yacht in the Dominican Republic owned by Dr. Salomon Melgen, a south Florida ophthalmologist. One e-mail purported to include a statement from a woman who said she was paid to have sex with the senator several times when she worked for "the Doll Palace" escort service in the spring of 2009. Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic, but only if the prostitute is 18 or older. Williams suggested that he and the women "will be willing to testify" about the allegations if their safety was guaranteed. His e-mail to CREW said he became aware of the alleged behavior while traveling in the Dominican Republic for "personal and business reasons" starting in 2008. CREW said it passed the "numerous" Williams e-mail exchanges on to the Justice Department and the FBI in July 2012, after the group was "unable to independently verify the truth of the allegations." But 10 months after the first contact with Williams, Sloan told CNN her group now has doubts about Williams' identity, motives and veracity. "This unnamed source said he has had this information about Sen. Menendez as early as 2008, yet he didn't come forward until four years later, right before Sen. Menendez was up for re-election," Sloan said. "Further, this source refused to ever speak by phone to us, with other news organizations, or with the FBI, so, those two facts combined to seriously undermine his credibility." CNN efforts to reach Williams through the e-mail address used to contact CREW have been unanswered. It is not known whether the FBI succeeded in talking directly to Williams, but there was a very public indication this week that the agency is investigating Melgen. Agents were seen carrying boxes from his Palm Beach, Florida, office Wednesday. An FBI spokesman in Florida confirmed there was "law enforcement activity" at the location where the search occurred but did not mention Melgen or anyone else and did not explain what agents were investigating. In 2011, the Internal Revenue Service hit Melgen with an $11 million tax lien. "The government has not informed Dr. Melgen what concerns it may have, his lawyer Dean L. Willbur Jr. told CNN in an e-mail Thursday. "We are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times. Additionally, any issues concerning Dr. Melgen and the IRS have been fully resolved and satisfied." Menendez calls Melgen a friend and political supporter. He acknowledged flying on the eye doctor's plane three times to the Dominican Republic in 2010, trips that he said were "paid for and reported appropriately." One of the trips involved official travel for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which he chairs, while the other two were personal trips, Menendez's spokeswoman Patricia Enright said. The senator is not required to publicly disclose information concerning personal travel, she said. The senator made a payment of $58,500 from his personal funds to Melgen's company on January 4 for the full operating costs of the two flights Menendez took in August and September 2010 to the Dominican Republic, Enright said. It was an "oversight" on the part of the senator not to have paid for the flights at the time he took them, she said. New Jersey state Sen. Sam Thompson, a Republican, sent a complaint to the Senate Ethics Committee in November calling for an investigation, saying Menendez may have violated Senate ethics by "repeatedly flying on a private jet to the Dominican Republic and other locations ... and soliciting prostitutes." Thompson said he did not hear back from the Ethics Committee. At an event in Washington on Thursday night, when asked by CNN whether be violated Senate finance rules, Menendez said, "These are nameless, faceless, anonymous allegations. You should find out from them." The Senate Ethics Committee said it could not comment. Enright said the senator assumes the committee is reviewing the matter, but he has not been contacted. CNN asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday whether he thought Menendez was handling the controversy properly. "First of all, Bob Menendez is my friend," Sen. Reid said. "He is an outstanding senator. He is now the new chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. Any questions in this regard direct to him. I don't know anything about it." "I think the issue of the trips alone are probably not enough to suggest that he doesn't have the right to assume the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee," Sloan said. "I think if all the allegations together prove to be true, that would certainly suggest questions about Sen. Menendez's fitness for the chairmanship and perhaps even his position in the Senate." The executive director for CREW, which sent the Williams e-mails to the FBI, said people should "withhold judgment given the many questions about the source of these allegations and the timing of these allegations. I think the best thing is to wait for the FBI to investigate and figure out what really happened here, if Sen. Menendez did something wrong and if not, who's really behind this effort to smear him." If this story evolves into a scandal and Menendez is forced to resign, the Democrats' majority in the Senate would likely get one vote thinner. New Jersey law allows Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, to appoint an interim senator until a special election, which would be no sooner than November.

Police are searching for any other alleged victims of a Sunday school teacher accused of raping and killing an 8-year-old girl from Tracy, California. Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter. "We are asking the public if they have any indication that any of their children may have had inappropriate contact with [the suspect] to contact us," Tracy Police Sgt. Tony Sheneman said Tuesday evening. "There has been no indication that this has happened. But she is a Sunday school teacher and did have contact with children, so that is why we are asking." Melissa Huckaby, 28, was arrested and charged with killing and raping 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, a friend of her 5-year-old daughter. Huckaby, wearing red jail scrubs over a white T-shirt, was in court Tuesday for an arraignment. She was charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14 and rape by instrument. If convicted, Huckaby would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett told reporters after the hearing. A decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made later, he said. Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the court hearing, although she flinched when Sandra Cantu's name was spoken, and she cried at times. Sandra's body was found April 6, stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a dairy farm. Huckaby was arrested Friday night after questioning by police. Sandra was last seen alive March 27 in the mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives with her daughter. The two children were close friends and played together frequently, police said. Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park, and she taught Sunday school at the church, police have said. The church was searched as part of the investigation into Sandra's disappearance and death. Before her arrest, Huckaby acknowledged to a newspaper reporter that she owned the suitcase that contained Sandra's body. But Huckaby said the suitcase had been stolen. Willett declined to comment on any of the evidence or allegations in the case, saying evidence would be presented in court. A memorial ceremony is scheduled for Sandra at 1 p.m. Thursday at a high school in Tracy, police said. -- CNN's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.
A policeman in London appears to have accidentally revealed an arrest plan for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, in what UK media have branded an embarrassing slip-up by London's Metropolitan Police. The photo, snapped by the Press Association news agency and published in several newspapers, shows a clipboard held by a uniformed officer Friday outside the Ecuadorian embassy where Assange has been holed up since June. Clearly legible in a zoomed-in view of the clipboard, on a sheet of paper headed "Restricted," are the words: "EQ Embassy brief - Summary of current position re. Assange. Action required - Assange to be arrested under all circumstances." It goes on to suggest possible ways in which he could exit the building, such as in a diplomatic bag or vehicle. The document also appears to warn of the possibilities of "distraction," perhaps by supporters of Assange who have previously rallied outside the central London embassy building. UK police have previously made clear that they intend to arrest Assange if he leaves the embassy, where he is shielded by its diplomatic protection. Ecuador says UK would be 'suicidal' to try and enter embassy for Assange But the carelessness of an officer in apparently exposing details of the force's plan will likely cause red faces. Asked about the photograph, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police told CNN "the document is not related to the Julian Assange case." The apparent slip-up is the latest twist in the Assange case, which has brought unlikely drama to the posh Knightsbridge neighborhood since he sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex crime allegations. This month, Ecuador officially offered Assange asylum in the South American country, but the British say they will not give him safe passage out of the embassy. The Foreign Office says Britain has a legal obligation to hand him over to Sweden, after Assange's legal efforts to avoid extradition were rejected by British courts up to the Supreme Court. The dispute gathered heat when the British Foreign Office, in a letter to Ecuadorian officials, cited a little known law that could temporarily suspend the embassy's diplomatic protection and allow authorities to enter and arrest Assange. Ecuador's resident has dismissed any steps in that direction as "suicidal." Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, said his client was willing to answer Swedish prosecutors' questions, but only if he was given certain guarantees. Assange, an Australian, and his supporters claim a U.S. grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him. He says the allegations against him in Sweden are politically motivated, and claims to fear Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he claims he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks. Sweden angrily rejected that allegation last week. What's next for Assange? CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.
Senate Republicans again Tuesday blocked Democratic legislation that would require greater transparency into who is behind much of the secretive, often negative campaign advertising filling the airwaves this election season. Supporters of the DISCLOSE Act mustered 53 votes in an effort to advance the bill, but fell short of the 60 needed to break a GOP filibuster. Democrats unanimously supported the bill, while Republicans voted unanimously against it. The legislation, which needs 60 votes to succeed, failed on a 51-44 vote Monday. The legislation would require certain tax-exempt groups involved in political advertising -- which currently are not required to disclose the names of their donors -- to release the names of those who give donations of $10,000 or more. A similar vote Monday ended with the same result. "During this election, outside spending by GOP shell groups is expected to top $1 billion," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, in a floor speech. "The names of these front groups contain words like 'freedom' and 'prosperity.' But make no mistake: there is nothing free about an election purchased by a handful of billionaires for their own self-interest." Read Reid's prepared statement Democrats say the requirement is a much-needed response to the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizen United decision, which opened the doors to large amounts of campaign spending by corporations, labor unions and other groups. The political advertising all those donations buy "threatens to drown out the voice of middle-class families in our democracy," argued Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, a chief sponsor of the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, led the GOP charge against the bill and accused Democrats of crafting it to favor labor unions -- traditionally Democratic allies -- over other types of donors. Read McConnell's statement "This legislation is an unprecedented requirement for groups to publicly disclose their donors, stripping a protection recognized and solidified by the courts," said McConnell, who has advocated for more disclosure in the past so long as it applies to all big players in campaign financing, such as labor unions and trial lawyers. McConnell cited a recent Wall Street Journal analysis that found labor unions spent $4.4 billion on campaigns between 2005 and 2011. Obama picks up campaign cash in the Lone Star State "Predictably, unions are exempted from the kind of disclosure Democrats now want to impose on others," McConnell said. Democrats disagreed with the Republicans' assertion that labor unions are exempt from their legislation. However, the concern about labor unions appeared to sway key Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a longtime vocal advocate of campaign finance reform, who said he would vote against the bill for that reason. Read McCain's full remarks "By conveniently setting high threshold for reporting requirements, the DISCLOSE Act forces some entities to inform the public about the origins of their financial support, while allowing others -- most notably those affiliated with organized labor -- to fly beneath the Federal Election Commission's regulatory radar," McCain said. McCain argued that local union chapters would not have to disclose payments from individual members if the amount was less than $10,000.

The Italian prime minister plans to declare Friday that the worst part of a garbage crisis in Naples is over, even though a visit to one neighborhood found residents still living amid huge piles of trash. Garbage has been piling up in the streets of Naples since a municipal dump was closed on December 31. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is due to make the announcement after a cabinet meeting in Naples, according to the national ANSA news agency. He is expected to say that the first phase of his government's response to the crisis -- the emergency phase -- is over. That first phase has involved cleaning up rotting garbage that has accumulated in the streets since the government closed one of two dumps in this southern Italian city. Now, Berlusconi plans to focus on the second phase of his response to the garbage crisis. That involves long-term solutions such as implementing a viable system of garbage collection, incineration and recycling. Despite the prime minister's planned announcement, however, a CNN correspondent who visited one neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples on Friday found residents still tossing garbage into the street. They said they had nowhere else to put it and complained of a lack of trash bins and recycling facilities. The piles were smaller than a few months ago, and the odor was not as bad, but the visit demonstrated that Berlusconi and his government have a long way to go in addressing the crisis. iReport.com: See trash piled high The prime minister told ANSA that the government had made great strides in addressing the problems. "Besides the 7,000 tons collected per day," he said, "we have collected 35,000 tons that were left unaddressed." Naples' garbage problems have been around in some form for nearly 15 years, but they flared December 31, when the Italian government closed one of the area's two working dumps at the request of nearby residents. As trash piled up, officials closed some schools to protect children from noxious fumes. The government moved some waste to temporary landfills and even shipped some of it to other parts of Italy and Europe. In May, two months after he took office, Berlusconi appointed a "garbage czar" to focus on the crisis, giving him the authority to open new dump sites and landfills in the region.
The number of children living with HIV is slowing down in areas of the world that typically account for the most new infections, the Joint U.N. Programme on HIV/AIDS said Tuesday. That's proof, organizers said, that a program it created to get antiretroviral medications to pregnant women is working. The program is known as "The Global Plan Toward Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping Their Mothers Alive." It was created by a joint effort between UNAIDS and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The initiative targets 22 countries that account for 90% of the world's new pediatric infections. The program gives antiretrovirals to pregnant women who are infected with HIV in those countries. The medicine prevents the transfer of the virus to their babies. Seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Ghana and Ethiopia -- have reduced the number of new HIV infections among children by 50% since 2009. HIV discovery 'will change your life forever' Ghana showed the most remarkable progress. The number of new pediatric infections there fell by 76% since 2009, according to a new report on the program. South Africa had a 63% decline. In South Africa and Botswana, transmission rates between mother and child are now below 5%. "The progress in the majority of countries is a strong signal that with focused efforts, every child can be born free from HIV," said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director. "But in some countries with high numbers of new infections progress has stalled. We need to find out why and remove the bottlenecks." One of the problems may be the small number of women who take antiretrovirals when breast-feeding. The report shows only half of all breast-feeding women living with HIV or their children receive these medicines to prevent mother-to-child infection. There is also an urgent need to improve early HIV diagnosis in children, according to UNAIDS. The goal of the program is to reduce mother-to-child transmissions by 90% and to reduce the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths by 50% by 2015. "Now we must all continue working together to see the day when no children are born with HIV," said U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Eric P. Goosby. This goal, he said, is clearly "within our reach." Could condoms change the world?
Admirers of the late Czech President Vaclav Havel lined Prague's famous Charles Bridge Wednesday as his coffin was moved to Prague Castle ahead of his state funeral Friday. Havel, who helped bring down communism in Czechoslovakia's 1989 Velvet Revolution, died Sunday, aged 75. A fiercely independent thinker with a wry, playful sense of humor, Havel became president of Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Moscow-backed regime, and the first president of the Czech Republic when it split peacefully from Slovakia three years later. The long-time chain smoker, whose health was permanently damaged by time in prison under the Communists, died peacefully in his sleep Sunday, his spokeswoman Sabina Tancevova said. People poured into the streets of Prague with candles and flowers in memory of him that night. His longtime friend and translator Paul Wilson remembered Havel as "a very shy and gentle man with a will of steel, who was fearless when confronting a regime that tried, relentlessly, to crush his spirit." Havel, an absurdist playwright turned political activist, spent four and a half years in prison for opposing Czechslovakia's Communist government before emerging as a leader of the Velvet Revolution. A deeply serious thinker given to long, rambling statements in presidential speeches and conversation, Havel also had an impish sense of humor, reportedly whizzing through the long corridors of Prague Castle on a scooter after becoming president. A perennial contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, Havel never won, but he remained active in anti-communist causes from Cuba to China until his death. He urged Chinese authorities to release dissident Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 call for greater political freedom in China was inspired by Czechoslovakia's Charter 77. Havel and other Czech dissidents attempted to deliver a letter to the Chinese Embassy in January 2010, before Liu won the Nobel Peace Prize, but they found the doors closed and no one to receive it. It was an absurd scene that could have come out of one of the plays he wrote in the 1960s, poking fun at the Soviet-backed authorities who ruled his country at the time. Theater proved a potent weapon against Czechoslovakia's Communist rulers, who stepped down without a shot being fired in the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the defeat of the region's authoritarian Moscow-backed regimes. Havel was unanimously elected president by the last Communist-run parliament of Czechoslovakia 22 years ago this month. His country joined NATO and the European Union under his stewardship, but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency, including his effort to keep Czechoslovakia together. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was "was inspired by his words and leadership. ... Vaclav Havel was a friend to America and to all who strive for freedom and dignity, and his words will echo through the ages." But speaking to to CNN's Jim Clancy in March, Havel expressed more modest wishes for how history would remember him. "I would be glad if it was felt that I have done something generally useful," he said. "I don't care much about personal fame or popularity. I would be satisfied with the feeling that I had a chance to help with something in general, something good. That history gave me that chance."
albeit not necessarily a definitive one. U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Wagahoff Dale issued her sweeping opinion knocking down Idaho state laws and a state constitutional amendment, passed in 2006, as failing to live up to the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee no "state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." "Idaho's marriage laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental right to marry and relegate their families to a stigmatized, second-class status without sufficient reason for doing so," Dale wrote. "These laws do not withstand any applicable level of constitutional scrutiny." The judge's order takes effect at 9 a.m. Friday. It was not immediately known if state authorities in Idaho, who have been fighting to keep in place the law restricting marriage as being between a man and a woman, will appeal this decision. That's what has happened in several other states, in which federal judges overturned state same-sex marriage bans only to have those decisions stayed on appeal. A federal appeals court last month heard challenges to same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar challenges over current bans in Nevada, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan. The three judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard related arguments Tuesday. Their final decision could affect Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Maryland, the latter being the only one of the five with legalized same-sex marriage. After that, the Supreme Court could then weigh in. And late last week in Arkansas, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza declared the state's voter-approved gay marriage ban to violate the Arkansas constitution. The plaintiffs in the Idaho case included four same-sex couples. They included two of whom married in others states and wanted their unions recognized in Idaho, and two of whom had children born while they were a couple. Among other opinions, Dale shot down Idaho authorities' argument that limiting marriage to a man and a woman is in children's best interests. For example, the judge says there's nothing preventing heterosexual couples from marrying simply for a tax break, or stopping them from marrying because they can't or don't want to have children or are "non-optimal parents." Furthermore, the judge said, those children who have gay or lesbian parents might pay the price, emotionally and otherwise, under the state ban. "Idaho's marriage laws fail to advance the state's interest because they withhold legal, financial and social benefits from the very group they purportedly protect -- children," Dale wrote. The judge also described the state's contention that gay marriage should be banned in the name of "religious liberty" to be "myopic." "No doubt many faiths around the world and in Idaho have longstanding traditions of man-woman marriage rooted in scripture," Dale said. "But not all religions share the view that opposite-sex marriage is a theological imperative." Even if a majority of people in Idaho oppose same-sex marriage, that doesn't mean their opinion should equate to law, according to the judge. She stated: "This case asks a basic and enduring question about the essence of American government: Whether the will of the majority, based as it often is on sincere beliefs and democratic consensus, may trump the rights of a minority."

most of the times -- their biological parents because they're suffering from some kind abuse or something like that, and so I don't think that being placed into a home where you suffer the same things solves much." She has been interning in the office of Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, who had her own encounter with an orphan at a young age and has been an advocate for foster children and orphans since she was first elected to office. "When I was a child, a young teenager, I literally found a little 9-year-old sleeping in a park and it was just horrifying to me that a child would be alone sleeping anywhere, let alone sleeping in a park," Landrieu said during an interview in her Capitol Hill office. "I brought him home and that was my beginning of understanding about a child that was homeless, living with a grandmother incapable of raising him. And then, of course, he went through the foster care system, and that's when I learned how broken it was." Landrieu, who helped create the internship program 10 years ago, said a tax credit to help families adopt and a program that helps provide education, and training vouchers to foster youth as they transition out of the system, have helped, but more needs to be done to improve the system. "The foster care interns that come to Washington learn a lot about the system here and how it affects their lives and the lives of children in foster care all over America, which are about 500,000," Landrieu said. "But most importantly, it educates members of Congress and their staffs about what really happens in our foster care system, and we think out of this great changes for the better will occur." Roberts is still searching for her younger brother, who she believes would be 17 or 18 years old now. "I worry constantly," she said. "I was able to be adopted and I had a lovely life and all these siblings that love me, I have a mom who loves me, you know I'm just living a great life right now. And I don't know if his situation was as blessed as mine was. "And then there's also -- he could have been bouncing around from foster home to foster home and I wasn't. He could have been adopted and it's possible his adoptive family didn't want him to have contact with his biological family, and I think about those things all the time." When she graduates in the winter, Roberts plans to pursue a career in broadcast journalism -- a field she loves and that she hopes might one day help Shawn find her. For now, she feels fortunate to have had what she calls a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend a summer in the halls of Congress and to share her story. "There are so many things I want people to know," she said. "One of the main things that I want people to know is that foster youth count."
If you have a heavy foot and may travel a bit over the speed limit, you might want to keep an eye out for these popular police car models. Not all police cars are as clearly marked as this one. What to watch for on the interstate The Ford Crown Victoria is the most popular police car currently in production. Renowned for its durability, many speeders have seen this unfortunate sight in their rear view mirror. But there are other patrol vehicles that road warriors should recognize, and many of them are faster than the popular Crown Vicky. Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor: The standard Officers value the Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor for its durability, size, and overall performance. These cruisers feature reinforced frames, a special 4.6-liter V-8, and other heavy-duty components that enable them to handle high-speed chases. According to The Michigan State Police, the fastest Crown Victoria Interceptor will hit 128 mph. Chevrolet Impala: Under the radar The Chevy Impala is one of the best-selling cars in the U.S. This makes it the perfect choice for police departments who want a car that blends in with traffic. The Impala's familiar shape doesn't stand out or call attention to itself. Fitted with the special Police Package (code 9C1), this mid-size sedan with a 3.9-liter V-6 engine hits an impressive 140 mph. Chevrolet Tahoe: Probably not taking kids to soccer camp Some police departments need the strength and power that only a full-size SUV can deliver. Fitted with the special PPV option, the big Chevy Tahoe SUV can hit 133 mph thanks to its high-performance 5.3-liter V-8 with 320 horsepower. Look for the black wheels with tiny center hubcaps as a tip-off should you see one unmarked or without a light bar. Dodge Magnum: The wagon that knows how to haul Dodge produced their last Magnum police car in 2008, but many police departments still have these station wagons in service. Fitted with the legendary 5.7-liter HEMI V-8, the wagon can hit 131 mph and charge up to that speed with muscle-car type performance. The wagon sprints from 0-60 mph in under six seconds. AOL Autos: Wonder wagons HUMMER H3: Special duty The H3 may be the smallest model in the HUMMER family, but it remains a very capable off-road vehicle. The police-version of the H3 is fortified for running off-road and carries other equipment necessary for police duty. The H3 can be equipped with a 5.3-liter V-8, but high-speed pursuit is not this vehicle's forte, except when the chase is across a desert, through fields, or over the Rubicon. Harley-Davidson Electra Glide: King of the road Police departments also utilize an assortment of motorcycles in their quest to keep motorists safe. The Michigan State Police test two-wheelers on an annual basis and the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide is a perennial favorite. While the Harley offers other performance benefits, with a top speed of just 104 mph, they are not the best for high-speed pursuits. Dodge Charger: That cop car's got a HEMI! The sight of a Dodge Charger police car should be enough to make you think twice about attempting to out run an officer behind the wheel of one of these. Equipped with the 5.7-liter HEMI V-8, the Charger can hit a staggering 146 mph. This makes the Dodge the fastest mainstream police car available. But what about vehicles that aren't mainstream? AOL Autos: Fast cars --join the 600 horsepower club Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Harper Woods, Michigan borders Detroit: It's a relatively quiet bedroom community that packs a big surprise for anyone speeding on the section of Interstate 94 running across its borders: a 2005 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Acquired to boost "community relations" and to intimidate speeders, the Shelby's supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 puts out 450 horsepower and will easily exceed 150 mph. AOL Autos: First drive of 2010 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Police ID: What to look for in unmarked vehicles Departments often use unmarked vehicles, many of which will be identical to their fully outfitted cruisers. Unmarked cars and trucks enable more stealthy operations. Tips for identifying unmarked police cars include looking for; light bars mounted in the rear window, municipal license plates, painted black wheels, and dividers between the front and rear seats. AOL Autos: Cops in the sky Future cop car: Coming to a highway near you Carbon Motors, a new company located in Georgia, is developing the E7, a purpose-built police interceptor. With a wheelbase of 122-inches and an overall length of 200-inches, the E7 is bigger than current Crown Victoria or Charger cop cars. Power for the E7 will be a 300-horsepower clean-diesel that should give the car a top-speed of 155 mph. AOL Autos: Speed cameras on U.S. roads
The streets of Manila can be an unforgiving place for the city's taxi and public transport drivers. Chronic traffic jams and badly maintained roads are part of the daily grind but add in the possibility of floods during the annual typhoon season and a strong constitution is needed. But Josefina Barandon doesn't mind, and as one of the city's few female drivers will happily take to the streets in her electric jeepney as long as she is able to, come rain or shine. Barandon is one of three women driving Manila's 20-strong fleet of electric public vehicles that ply the streets of Makati, the capital's central business district. If her vehicle is a rare sight among the traditional diesel-spewing jeepneys on the roads, even rarer is seeing a woman behind the wheel of a vehicle of any description. "All our passengers are happy if they see women drivers because they think the lady drivers are honest," says Barandon. "Our jeepneys are better taken care of, we clean our own and decorate them at our own expense." Barandon was a taxi operator and then driver before switching from her petrol-powered cab to an electric jeepney in March. It was her good fortune that one of the fares she picked up from the airport last year was Yuri Sarmiento, CEO of Ejeepney Transport, who suggested she swap her taxi for an electric jeepney and with it gain a steady form of employment. Like other drivers of taxis and jeepneys, Barandon regularly used to work shifts of up to 24-hours in order to pay for the hire of the vehicle and then make enough money to support her family. Being an electric jeepney driver is the first time that Barandon has had the benefits and security that most people expect with a job -- a daily shift of eight-hours, health insurance and a weekly paycheck. The e-jeepneys of Makati are still officially a pilot initiative, but only bureaucratic red tape has prevented it from becoming commercial and charging passengers 8 pesos ($0.20) per ride, says Reina Garcia, project coordinator for the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, which organizes the Makati-based project. "As well as the environmental impact, we wanted it to help women to have the same opportunity as male drivers," says Garcia. "Economically and socially women are one of the most vulnerable sectors in society, we wanted them to enjoy the same benefits from the electric jeepney project, such as increased income." Statistics suggest that women in the Philippines have been successful in gaining ground against men. Ranked eighth on the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index, the Philippines outperforms the U.S., Germany and all other Asian countries in terms of gender equality in economic opportunity, health, political participation and education. According to the figures, women outnumber men in the field of senior officials, managers and professional and technical workers, but still lag behind men in terms of equal wages. Despite some gains for women in the workplace there are plenty of hurdles still to overcome, believes Florencia Cabatingan, chair of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines Women's Committee. "Discrimination in hiring is something we're aiming to work on. While jobs won't officially advertise for a man, there will be criteria which points to men and not women, like 'we need someone six-feet tall,' or request a qualification that makes it clear men need to be hired." Notions that traditional diesel jeepneys are too heavy for women to drive are slowly being eroded, or completely bypassed with lighter electric versions, although Barandon says that even her family still finds it funny she drives a jeepney. Macho attitudes from male drivers could also still deter other women from wanting to get behind the wheel. "Sometimes the male drivers, like taxi drivers, they bully women drivers, overtake unnecessarily and think that women drivers can't do what they are doing," says Barandon. But when it comes to fare-paying passengers, Barandon believes most would like to see more women on the roads. "Attitudes have changed. Our passengers are comparing women drivers in other countries, and society in the Philippines already accepts that women drivers are much better (than men)," she says with a smile.
Yemen's largest opposition coalition blamed President Ali Abdullah Saleh's ruling family for causing chaos in the town of Radda, Baitha province, and said the family intentionally eased the way for al Qaeda militants to take over the town. The Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) said this strategy was used in an effort to delay the presidential elections and halt the power transfer from taking place. "Only Saleh would hand over a town to terrorists. He does not care for Yemen or its people," said Ahmed Bahri, a senior JMP leader. Numerous tribal chiefs told CNN that the suspected al Qaeda militants are now in control of the Sawadia Republican Guard's base in Radda and entered the town without a fight. Saleh's eldest son, Ahmed, runs the guards. "Everything was handed over to the militants. What other explanation can there be? Hundreds of Republican Guard forces suddenly evacuated the base without a fight," said Abdullah al-Barraki, a tribal chief in Radda. CNN was able to independently verify that the militants were now in control of the base. Radda, located just 107 miles southeast of Yemen's capital Sana'a, has been without any security presence for more than six days, according to residents. Tribal chiefs in the town are negotiating with the militants to leave the town without bloodshed. This comes as thousands of anti-Saleh protesters marched in the streets of Radda on Wednesday, condemning what they say was an act of treachery by relatives of Saleh. "Saleh's nephew and son handed over the town to the militants. They wanted al Qaeda to take over the town to raise the tension in the country," said Sameer Ashtal, a youth protester in Radda. He added, "Saleh is willing to destroy to the entire country for the sake of himself, and that is why he has to leave power." Marchers in Radda chanted, "Saleh's family sold Radda. He will stand trial for this crime." Last week, dozens of militants loyal to Tareq al-Thahab, an extremist militant, took over historical sites in Radda and called for the implementation of Sharia law. Khaled al-Thahab, a prominent tribal leader and brother of the al Qaeda leader in Radda, said that the National Security Forces assisted his brother in taking over the town. The national security sector is directly run by Ammar Mohammed, the nephew of Saleh. The JMP warned the international community that certain factions will be seeking to halt the power transfer deal worked out with the Gulf Cooperation Council. "The JMP are completely abiding (by) the GCC power transfer deal while Saleh's ruling family is doing otherwise," said Mohammed Qahtan, a senior opposition Islah official, and former spokesperson for the JMP. CNN contacted the office of Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to clarify the reasons behind the growing tension, but they refused to comment. Saleh signed away executive powers to Hadi on November 23, allowing him to keep the title of president for 90 days but officially ending his rule. Hadi is expected to win the February 21 presidential elections and be the country's next leader. Jamal Ben Omar, the United Nations envoy to Yemen, insists that presidential elections will not be delayed. "There is no space to negotiate the delay of the Yemeni presidential elections," he said. Ali al-Amrani, Yemen's minister of information, told CNN that an immunity bill for Saleh is expected to be passed on Saturday after differing factions met at Hadi's residence on Wednesday and finalized most differing points. The bill has been the core of controversy between the opposition and the president. The bill, if passed, will grant Saleh immunity from prosecution for all crimes and violations committed during his 33 years in power.
This journey began with such a simple idea: a day of peace. We all want a world without war, without conflict, without human suffering. A single day is a window of opportunity. On September 21 last year, Peace Day 2011, my organization, Peace One Day launched the 365-day countdown toward a global truce -- what we hope will be the largest reduction in global violence in recorded history, both domestically and internationally, and the biggest ever gathering of individuals in the name of peace. It would be the global community's legacy, not mine. What we want to tell individuals is that the power to change the world lies in their hands. I don't believe in cynicism, in apathy; it doesn't get you anywhere. Cynicism kills potential and possibility. And if we're not working towards a better world, what's the point? When I was younger, I read a book by Frank Barnaby, this wonderful nuclear physicist. He said that media had a responsibility, that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and move things forward. And that fascinated me. I was concerned about what was going on in the world. I couldn't understand the starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people. I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life; I thought, well maybe I could do something. Maybe I could become a filmmaker. Maybe I can use the form of film constructively. TED.com: In defense of dialogue I thought I could go and film older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of what was going on around the world. But I realized that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough, that there needed to be a mountain to climb, there needed to be a journey that I had to take. And if I took that journey, it would be completely irrelevant whether it failed or succeeded. The point is that there would be a hook: Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Is humankind fundamentally evil? As we become a global community, are we becoming indifferent to one another? When it comes to the fundamental issues that humanity faces, solutions involve shifting consciousness towards cooperation. A single day is an achievable starting point. Making that starting point a self-sustaining, institutionalized celebration is what we work towards at Peace One Day. TED.com: Poems of war, peace, women and power Each year, September 21 marks Peace Day -- a day for wide-scale community action, and a day for United Nations agencies and aid organizations to safely carry out life-saving work. By 2007, 100 million people were active on Peace Day and since then, Peace Day agreements by all parties to conflict in Afghanistan have resulted in the immunization against polio of 4.5 million children in areas hitherto unreachable or hard to reach due to conflict. On Peace Day 2008, the U.N. Department for Safety and Security recorded a 70% reduction in violent incidents in Afghanistan. For Peace Day 2012, we are inviting all sectors of society to observe a day of Global Truce -- individuals in every country, at home, in schools, in the workplace, in our local communities, and those engaged in armed conflict on the international stage. Everyone has a role to play. The Global Truce 2012 campaign will only work if the people get behind it-- if you get behind it. Please join the campaign via www.peaceoneday.org and ask as many people as you can to do the same, via social media or via the new free Peace One Day App. Individuals can make a difference. By working together there will be Peace One Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeremy Gilley.
The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week passed a 10-year, $829 billion health care reform bill -- partly because of a "yes" vote from a lone Republican, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. Snowe doesn't appear to be on Twitter. Too bad. But plenty of other people are posting about health care reform and the U.S. health care system on the micro-blogging site. This list of health care twitterers is by no means comprehensive, so feel free to tell us about your favorites in the comments section below. 1. PolitiFact: The health care reform debate has been nothing if not confusing. "Death panels," "tea parties," Rep. Joe Wilson shouting "You lie!" at the president.

A Florida man apologized Tuesday for boarding his daughter's school bus earlier this month and threatening the other children and the driver, saying he acted out of frustration over students bullying his daughter. "I handled it the wrong way when I went on the bus," James Jones said. He said he does not condone storming on the bus or his profanity-laced tirade in front of students. "I really strongly believe we should do it a different way," he said. "But at that time, in the heat of the moment, I did it the wrong way." He urged parents not to follow his example, but to use available resources and talk to the school if their child is being bullied. Jones was arrested a week after the incident, said attorney Natalie Jackson, who accompanied him at a news conference Tuesday. He is facing two misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing a school function, according to CNN affiliate WESH. Jones, of Lake Mary, Florida, and his wife claim they had attempted to talk to school officials about the bullying of their daughter. The Seminole County School District, in a statement released last week, denied that the couple had reported the bullying and said his actions were "not acceptable behavior," according to CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13. The district said one incident Jones alleged had happened on the bus actually involved another student, not his daughter, and that incident was investigated and "appropriate action taken," according to the station. Jones addressed that Tuesday, saying a condom was thrown at another student, but went past his daughter, who found "something wet" on her hair. The girl was told by someone else that a boy had spit in her hair, he said. But he said the girl also has been called names and pushed around. Jones said he found his daughter had been avoiding the bullying by skipping school. She would hide in bushes to avoid the school bus and return home while her parents were at work, he said. The girl has cerebral palsy, according to Central Florida News 13. The girl's mother, Deborah McFadden-Jones, drove her to school in the days before the incident, Jackson said Tuesday, but could not that day, September 3, because she had a funeral to attend. The girl refused to go to school, she said, and her father said he would drive her to the bus stop and talk to those involved. But before the bus arrived, the girl began crying, and told her father about specific bullying incidents, Jones said. He said he was frustrated because she was so upset, and "snapped." His intention was, "I was going to be a dad and I was going to at least talk to the bus driver and find out what was going on with my daughter," he said. He said he had received numerous messages of support from other parents, but wanted to dissuade them from doing something similar. Jackson said Jones held Tuesday's news conference because he wanted to draw attention to national anti-bullying organizations like the National Center for Bully Prevention, and to National Bullying Prevention Month, in October. "It's not about me. It's about kids that are getting bullied going to school," he said, adding that his actions were "out of character." He admitted that by launching into the profanity-laced tirade, he was acting as a bully. "I thought I was backed up against the wall as a parent," he said. "We definitely don't want to promote that." At the time, Jones said the incident had upset his daughter so much that she had to be hospitalized. He said she was still in the hospital Tuesday. She will not be returning to that school, he said, adding he is looking into what to do next. McFadden-Jones said her daughter was attempting to stand up for other bullying victims when "it turned on her and there was no one to help her. ... She felt alone." She said she had noticed her daughter keeping to herself more. "She wasn't involved with the family like she normally would be on a regular basis," McFadden-Jones said. She said when she drove her daughter to school before the incident, she asked to speak with a guidance counselor but was told the counselor was not available. She asked for the counselor's phone number and called from the parking lot "and I let them know I needed to talk to her about my daughter." No one responded, she said. Jones encouraged parents to talk to their children about the situation at school. "Get involved in your kid's life," he said.
Seen the ball drop in New York's Times Square? Caught the fireworks over Sydney Harbour? There are plenty of other ways to ring in the New Year. Byron Bay, Australia Among the first places in Australia to see the sun rise, Byron Bay in New South Wales hosts one of the country's largest parties on New Year's Eve. This year, for the first time, the three-day Falls Music & Arts Festival will take over the town from December 31 to January 3, which means tunes from MGMT, Grizzly Bear, The Roots and Vampire Weekend. Away from the North Byron Parklands, festivities will feature family friendly activities from 9 p.m., plus an early morning event on Main Beach on the first day of the New Year. If you don't have a ticket to Falls, aren't a local or don't have a hotel booked, you won't get in. The mayor is planning to "lock" everyone else out in order to "curb alcohol-fueled violence and destruction of property in the town." Good times apparently await those who have prepared in advance. The Falls Music & Arts Festival Goa, India Balmy weather, beaches, al fresco bars and restaurants -- India's smallest state is one of its biggest party centers. Goan celebrations kick off on December 27 with the three-day Sunburn music festival -- headliners include Pete Tong, Markus Schultz and Afrojak, among other DJs. Parties on New Year's Eve range from masquerade balls to beach raves. If you don't mind crowds, Anjuna Beach has dance performances, Goan folk music and plenty of feni (a local liquor), while the sunset party at Querim Beach's nightclub Kitty Su takes things outdoors with some of the country's top music acts on the sand. At the Hill Top event, near Vagator Beach, a globetrotting roster of trance musicians will entertain revelers well into New Year's Day. Sunburn Goa Hill Top Festival Goa Prague, Czech Republic Prague locals love their fireworks, so much so that many contribute their own to the New Year's Eve festivities around town. The official show explodes over the Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square at midnight; the best vantage points are from the Charles Bridge, Petřín Hill and near Prague Castle. Vltava River cruises are free from crowds and provide Czech beer and live jazz. January 1 is particularly poignant to Prague locals as it marks the day the Czech Republic was created after the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1993. A special fireworks display will be held at Letná Park on the day, kicking off at 6 p.m. to ensure that families with young children can attend. Harbin, China New Year's Eve festivities don't get much cooler than those held in the northern Chinese city of Harbin. Not far from the Russian border, the city gets temperatures well below freezing in winter, perfect for the annual Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival. Celebrating 30 years, the festival sees larger-than-life ice sculptures crafted around town, lit either by lasers or with traditional lanterns. Visitors can walk on icy replicas of the Great Wall, check out St. Basil's Cathedral or stare at a replica Eiffel Tower before fireworks light up the night sky. Another icy tradition takes place when swimmers jump into the city's Songhua River. Harbin Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival Niagara Falls, Canada Billed as Canada's largest free New Year's Eve extravaganza, the December 31 concert at Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls is expected to draw more than 40,000 people. Kicking off at 7.30 p.m. and held against the epic backdrop of Niagara Falls, which straddles the American and Canadian border, this year's event features music from the Sam Roberts Band and Serena Ryder, with Demi Lovato headlining. The party includes food stalls, entertainers and two fireworks displays, at 8.45 p.m. and midnight. You can continue the noise on the first day of 2014 with a Journey Behind the Falls tour, allowing you to stand in the mist where the mighty Horseshoe Falls tumbles from a height of 13 stories, traveling at 65 kilometers per hour. Niagara Falls Festival Reykjavik, Iceland December 31 sees crowds converge on 10 bonfires lit around Iceland's capital before revelers make their way to Hallgrimskirkja church, a dramatic 73-meter-high building designed to resemble the country's lava flows. Perlan (The Pearl), a hemispherical building atop Öskjuhlíð hill with a winter garden and dining areas, provides a more panoramic view of town. Fireworks are sold throughout the city, which means that explosions can be heard from the moment the sky darkens. The intensity builds toward midnight, when a spectacular choreographed display lights the city. The festival of lights can often continue on New Year's Day when tourists head off in search of the aurora borealis. Cruise ship, Various If you can't decide on one destination, a cruise offers a roster of ports. All cruise lines ring in the New Year with pomp and ceremony, but a few go the extra mile. Crystal Cruises hosts a balloon drop in the atrium of its two ships, followed by a ship-wide countdown at midnight, with champagne. On New Year's Day, celebrations continue with a boozy brunch. On December 31, Crystal Symphony will be docked in Sydney Harbour, under the bridge, so you're guaranteed a dazzling introduction to 2014. Norwegian Cruise Line ships will have fireworks and a captain's countdown from the bridge. "The Pride of America" is scheduled to arrive next to Hawaii's volcanoes on the first day of 2014. Weather permitting, the Oceania Cruises' fleet will hold New Year's Eve soirees on their decks, as well as parties throughout the ships. Passengers can look forward to live music, noisemakers, party hats and plenty of bubbles. Crystal Cruises Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises Whistler, British Columbia The Canadian winter sports resort town is hosting a Youth Dance and NYE kids' countdown in Millennium Place, with fire spinners, dancers, circus entertainers, live music and a giant bubble wrap stomp and balloon drop at 9 p.m. At the Fire and Ice Show, Whistler's best skiers and riders jump through blazing rings of fire as guests dance into the New Year. A dazzling display of lights and sounds will ring in the new year. Fireworks are best viewed from Skier's Plaza located at the base of Whistler Mountain, or from the skating rink at Whistler Olympic Plaza. Whistler New Year's Eve Walt Disney World, Florida Most evenings at Walt Disney World near Orlando go off with a bang, but the entertainment on New Year's Eve is particularly spectacular. The attraction -- home to four theme parks, two water parks and 24 themed resorts -- fills up fast, so it's wise to arrive early. Most of the theme parks welcome visitors an hour earlier than normal and stay open until 1 or 2 a.m. on New Year's Day. The Magic Kingdom offerings include the Electrical Parade at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., the Holiday Wishes fireworks at 8:30 p.m. and Fantasy in the Sky fireworks at 11:50 p.m. Epcot will have shows at 6:30 p.m. and 11:40 p.m., plus DJs throughout the evening at the Future World Fountain Stage. Hollywood Studios will showcase fireworks and special effects at midnight with the theme "Mulch, Sweat and Shears" -- a series of four concerts. Walt Disney World Chiang Mai, Thailand The northern Thai city of Chiang Mai officially celebrates Loi Krathong (the Festival of Lights) in the 12th lunar month (this year, November), but the dazzling extravaganza is repeated in part on New Year's Eve. Locals and visitors gather on Thapae Road (closed to traffic from dusk) around the Thapae Gate, where food stalls line the street and musicians and dancers entertain. Even before the sun disappears, paper lanterns are released into the sky. Things are more subdued, but equally illuminating, at the city's Buddhist temples. Candle-lit shrines at Wat Phan Tao, among others, set the scene for more paper lanterns floating into the night sky, with fireworks at midnight. At Ping River, visitors can also watch floating lanterns being released onto the waterway.
A rocket fired by Palestinian militants fell on a Gaza home and killed two children, Palestinian sources said Friday, the same day Israel opened three Gaza border crossings for the first time in 10 days. A truck carrying grain enters Gaza from Israel on Friday at the Karni crossing point, one of three Israel reopened. A third child was in critical condition. The children, all girls, were cousins -- the two who died were 7 and 12, and the injured child is 5, Hamas security and Palestinian medical sources said. The rocket struck a house north of Gaza City. In a separate development, the Israeli military said it allowed a Palestinian who was badly wounded by rocket fire Wednesday to enter Israel for treatment. The Palestinian entered Israel through the Erez Crossing between northern Gaza and Israel. Israel closed the crossing for all but humanitarian reasons because of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel by Palestinian militants. But it opened three other crossings Friday, allowing fuel and commodities into the Palestinian territory for the first time in more than a week. About 80 trucks filled with commodities were expected to cross into Gaza. Among the goods were 400,000 liters of fuel and 120 tons of cooking gas. The decision to open the crossings at Kerem Shalom, Karni and Nahal Oz came after requests from international aid groups and Egypt, said Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. In addition, he said, Israel has no desire to hurt the civilian population in Gaza. Lerner said whether to keep the crossings open would be a daily decision. United Nations assistance programs in Gaza have run out of flour and several essential pharmaceuticals, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. A tenuous six-month truce between the Hamas government in Gaza and Israel expired a week ago. Under the Egyptian-brokered deal, Hamas agreed to end militant attacks on Israel from Gaza, and Israel agreed to halt raids inside the territory and ease its blockade on humanitarian goods. In reality, the truce started breaking down two months ago. Rocket attacks by militants became more frequent, and Israel resumed airstrikes inside Gaza. Since then, dozens of rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants into Israel. Israel Defense Forces said about nine rockets have been launched from Gaza since midnight, pushing the three-day total to more than 110. There are no reports of casualties in Israel. The crossings opened a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met in Cairo and Egypt expressed concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Livni criticized Hamas after her meeting with Mubarak. "Hamas needs to understand that Israel's basic desire to live in a tranquil region doesn't mean that Israel is willing to accept ongoing shooting at its population," she said, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. "Enough is enough. We cannot accept this situation, and the situation will change." Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has threatened to respond to the escalating violence. He warned Hamas again Thursday in an interview on the Al Arabiya television network and seemed to suggest that time was running out. "We do not want to fight the Palestinian people, but we will not allow Hamas to strike our children," Olmert said. "I did not come here to declare war," he continued. "But Hamas must be stopped -- and so it will be. "I will not hesitate to use Israel's strength to strike at Hamas and Islamic Jihad. How? I do not wish to go into details here."
One Direction dropped their new Ed Sheeran-penned single, "Little Things" — a followup to their hit "Live While We're Young" and the second track released from the upcoming Take Me Home — Monday, and as expected, there's nothing "little" about its online reaction. Though the official lyric video has only been live for a few hours, it has already received over 127,000 likes and 55,000 comments on YouTube, and as young girls across the U.S. wake up and check their Tumblrs, those metrics are only going to soar higher. Because of that massive, adoring fanbase of occasionally irrational Directioners, I realize what I'm about to write might not be especially popular, but I've got to be honest: this song is kind of messed up. Yes, it's a pretty, strummy offering that gives each boy his own solo (for the first time, every individual's voice is clearly recognizable), and yes, the stripped-back melody is rather lovely and characteristically Ed Sheeran-y, but it's the lyrics that I find troubling. I mean, just look at 'em: "I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes," sings Liam Payne during the second stanza of the song. "You've never loved your stomach or your thighs / the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine / but I love them endlessly." Later in the song, during Harry Styles' verse, he sings, "You still have to squeeze into your jeans / but you're perfect to me." Perhaps I'd hear those lyrics differently if Ed Sheeran had released this song for his own fans, but this is officially a One Direction song now, and there's something icky about the endlessly coiffed and tailored (not to mention athletically-built) boys delivering those words. Last I checked, One Direction's fans aren't composed mainly of aging obesity victims — they're little girls who range in age from about 8-14. At the older end of that spectrum are girls currently enduring middle school, who may very well be feeling insecure about their bodies. In that case, it seems terribly misguided (or at least ruthlessly conniving) to tap into that insecurity with "Little Things" and ask girls to find their validation in One Direction's blanket affection. But I could maybe see how people would find the words sweet. More troubling to me are the younger fans who listen to this song. The carefree 9-year-olds who nibble on fruit roll-ups on the way to gymnastics class. The ones who watch Good Luck Charlie before bed, getting one last year out of their Sleeping Beauty nightgowns. "Little Things" presupposes insecurity in order to be effective lyrically, but for all those happily naive fans that (thankfully!) aren't dealing with body image issues, One Direction literally provides insecurities for listeners to feel. But that's just part of why the whole pseudo-chivalrous "You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you" vibe feels so disingenuous. One Direction doesn't — they simply can't — love each of their fans as much as they say they do. Not in the way an insecure person needs to be loved to escape that awful cycle of self-reflection. They're an international phenomenon touring the globe and clinking glasses with the rich and beautiful, not psychiatric counselors. Their therapy by way of crooning is simply undercooked.

The $410 billion budget President Obama signed Wednesday will make it easier for U.S. residents to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. It also could facilitate the sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The residents of Havana, Cuba, often rely on bicycle taxis for transportation. Three provisions attached to the omnibus spending bill loosened restrictions enacted by then-President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001. Analysts see the move as a way for the new Obama administration to start thawing relations with Cuba one month before the Fifth Summit of the Americas brings together the U.S. president and 33 other leaders from the Western Hemisphere in Trinidad and Tobago. "[Cuba] is the issue of greatest symbolic importance," said Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. "It will be seen as a test of real U.S. readiness to change in the hemisphere. What he says about Cuba will make headlines." Hakim testified about Latin American policy Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Cuba and the United States have had a troubled relationship since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The United States broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 and imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Bush tightened some of those restrictions in recent years, most notably limiting travel to the island to once every three years for a limit of 14 days. Under the new provisions, relatives will be able to go once a year and stay for an unlimited time. In addition, the definition of relatives has been broadened to include uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. The new measures also increase the amount of money visitors can spend. Otto Reich, who served presidents Reagan and both Bushes in a number of high-level Latin American posts, also testified Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Reich and Hakim have different perspectives on how far Obama should go on improving relations with Cuba, but they agree that attaching the latest measures to the spending bill was the wrong way to do it. "It's important to open up Cuba, but it should be done systematically," Hakim told CNN. "This is very important for the Cuban American community. It ought to be done with them at the table. If they're not involved, they're going to push back." Initial opposition from two Democratic senators with large Cuban American communities in their states put the spending bill in jeopardy. Senators Bill Nelson of Florida and Bob Menendez of New Jersey voted for the budget Tuesday after receiving personal letters from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner assuring them that the new provisions will not alter U.S. policy. Reich said he did not like the Cuba provisions in the budget because the United States gets nothing in return. "I'm opposed to it because of the way it was done," he said. "There's a way it can be done to advance the conditions of the people in Cuba. I don't approve of the unilateral way it's being done. The embargo is a negotiating tool. We should not negotiate with ourselves, and that's what we're doing." Hakim warns that too much should not be read into the new measures, saying, "The fact is that this is very minor." Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, said in a policy statement Wednesday that the new provision "suffers from being too little and too late." Similar measures have been attached to previous spending bills in the past eight years but Bush threatened to veto the legislation, so the language was scrapped. Senators Nelson and Menendez were most concerned with the provision that allows cash advance sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. Before Bush, "cash advance" used to mean that money would have to be paid as soon as the goods reached Cuba. But the Bush Administration said "cash advance" had to mean money was sent before the cargo was loaded on ships in the United States for Cuba. The language in the new spending bill reverts the meaning to the previous "cash-on-delivery" method favored by U.S. farmers and exporters. Some members of Congress also were concerned the new provisions would allow credit sales, which would poke major holes in the economic embargo. But Geithner's letters to Nelson and Menendez assured them this would not happen. He did tell the senators, though, the Obama administration is reviewing its policies toward Cuba. CNN State Department Producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.
Veteran Tommy Haas described his fourth round victory over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic at the Miami Masters as "one of the best wins of my career". The German, who reached No. 2 in the world rankings in 2002, kept his cool to become only the second player this year to beat double defending champion Djokovic in an ATP Tour event. The 6-2 6-4 triumph was Haas' third win over six-time grand slam winner Djokovic in seven career meetings and his first win against a top-ranked player since he beat Andre Agassi in 1999. "I'm just really happy and proud of that tonight, against such a great player who has been dominating the sport the past couple of years, I really took advantage of the opportunities I've gotten," the 34-year-old German told the tournament's official website. "I think I played extremely well. He gave me a lot of looks, and I took advantage of it." "These are the moments I appreciate the most, going on those big stadiums, big stages, playing against the best people in the world. Playing against someone like Novak and coming out on top at this time of my career, it's unbelievable." Djokovic was magnanimous in defeat, praising his opponent while also admitting he was well below his own exceptionally high standards. "All the credit to him," said the Serb, who also lost to Juan Martin del Potro at the recent Indian Wells Masters event. "He played a great match and he was the better player, no question about it. "The results show everything. As far as I'm concerned, it's definitely the worst match I have played in a long time." Haas advanced to play French 11th seed Gilles Simon, in what is the first all-European quarterfinal line-up in the event's history. Djokovic's defeat means second seed Andy Murray is the highest-ranked player left in the draw. The 2012 U.S. Open champion breezed beyond Italy's Andreas Seppi to set up a last-eight meeting with Croatia's Marin Cilic, who upset fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. No. 3 David Ferrer won in straight-sets against Japan's Kei Nishikori, cruising to a 6-4 6-2 success. Spain's Ferrer will play Austria's Juergen Melzer for a place in the semifinals. The quarterfinal line-up is completed by fourth seed Tomas Berdych and Frenchman Richard Gasquet, who defeated Sam Querrey and Nicolas Almagro respectively.
Answers about the crash that killed actor Paul Walker and his friend Roger Rodas may be in the computer system of the rare Porsche they were riding in. Investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will meet with engineers from Porsche next month to analyze the data retrieval system, the department said. That system could shed light on the car's speed, throttle opening, air bag deployment, seat belt use and possibly other information from the time of the crash. Walker, the 40-year-old star of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, died on November 30 when the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT he was riding in slammed into a pole and burst into flames. Rodas was behind the wheel. Porsche Carrera GT: 5 reasons the car Paul Walker died in is different The exact cause of the crash remains unclear, but witnesses told authorities the car was speeding near a business park in the Santa Clarita community of Valencia, California. The posted speed limit in the area is 45 mph. A toxicology report, which could show if drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident, won't be available for several more weeks. Walker was attending a holiday toy donation event for his charity, Reach Out WorldWide, on the day of the crash when he hopped into the car with Rodas for a ride, witnesses said. 5 things to know about Roger Rodas After the crash, Los Angeles authorities arrested a man accused of swiping a piece of the charred Porsche while it was on a tow truck. Thousands of fans across the country mourned Walker's death on social media and at the scene of the crash, where Walker's co-star Tyrese Gibson broke down sobbing as he laid a yellow flower at the site. Paul Walker purchased wedding ring for U.S. soldier Walker was in the middle of filming the seventh "Fast & Furious" movie when he died. Universal Pictures said it has put production on hold "for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise." 'Hours' director: Paul Walker was excited about new career direction CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.
A Florida man was denied bond Monday on a murder charge stemming from a weekend shooting that started with a complaint about loud music and ended with a teenager dead. A statement by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office described a Friday-night confrontation in a gas station parking lot that escalated into at least eight shots being fired at a car carrying a group of teenagers. Seventeen-year-old Jordan Davis, among the teens, was fatally wounded. Forty-five-year-old Michael Dunn of Brevard County, Florida, was arrested Saturday and charged in the fatal shooting. According to the statement from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Dunn told authorities that he had asked the teens to turn down loud music from their vehicle adjacent to his, as he waited while his girlfriend, who was returning with him from a wedding, went inside the gas station to make a purchase. Dunn told police he felt threatened by the response from the teens, the statement said. Dunn's attorney, Robin Lemonidis, told CNN Monday that Dunn told police that he reacted after having seen a gun barrel in the window of the teens' car and after hearing a profanity-laced string of threats against him and his girlfriend while the teens motioned they were opening the door. Lemonidis said that was when Dunn reached for his gun and opened fire on the vehicle. She added that, "When all the evidence has been flushed out, I believe that it will be extremely clear that Mr. Dunn acted as any responsible firearm owner would have under the same circumstances." Eight or nine shots were fired at the teens' car, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office statement added. There were no guns found inside the teens' car, the statement said. Lemonidis said her client and his girlfriend left the scene after the shooting, fearing that they had encountered gang members and that more would follow. The couple went to a local hotel for the night, and saw the news the next morning that Davis had died. They returned to Dunn's home in Brevard County, where local police arrested him Saturday on an out-of-county warrant. Dunn was arraigned Monday afternoon, and Lemonidis said she entered a not-guilty plea on her client's behalf. Ron Davis, the victim's father, told CNN affiliate WAWS that he wants to see justice, "Whether it be through the legal system or to God. God's going to punish him for that, so me, I don't want to do anything to him."
Don't ask music super-producer Benny Blanco to whip up a No. 1 song for an artist because it ain't gonna happen. Sure, the man knows how to make hits: His work on Rihanna's "Diamonds" and Ke$ha's "Die Young" landed both at the top of the Billboard charts. But he's the first to tell you that trying to compose a chart topper is almost always guaranteed to fail. "When you're like, 'Yo, we gotta write a hit song, we need a hit song right now," that never works," Blanco told CNN. "Every time that happens, I never write a hit song. I write a s****y song that sounds like someone trying to make a hit song." Blanco knows of what he speaks. Two of the songs he helped produce are up for Grammys this year: Maroon 5's "Payphone," nominated for best pop duo or group performance, and Trey Songz's "Heart Attack," which is competing for best R&B song. Blanco said in an era where singles rule (seriously, when was the last time you bought an entire album?) the pressure is on labels, artists and producers more than ever to produce a song that will head straight to the top of the charts. But what does that song look and sound like? Is it an earworm such as Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe"? An intensely personal tale such as Adele's "Set Fire to the Rain" or a breezy "I can relate to that" poppy tune such as Taylor Swift's "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together." The answer is yes. "Everything needs to be a hook," said Blanco, who snagged the Songwriter of the Year Award at the BMI Pop Awards in 2012 along with Ester Dean and Pitbull. "Everything needs to be catchy because a listener is either going to stay with the song or lose interest in the first five seconds. But people also like those songs they can relate to and say, 'Yeah, I went through that.' " Chris Mooney, senior director of artist promotions at TuneCore, said artists looking for a No. 1 song have to prepare their fans for a release by using every social media tool available: YouTube videos, tweets, Facebook postings, etc. TuneCore distributes music for artists through partners such as iTunes and Spotify for a nominal fee. The company does not, he said, take a percentage of the revenue of the music distributed, and that business model has attracted such well-known acts as Nine Inch Nails, Ziggy Marley and the Civil Wars to use the service. But if an artist wants to have a true No. 1 smash across the country, he or she will have to resort to some old-fashioned methods, Mooney said. "You really need radio play, and that's not something everyone can do," he said. "But I still think that's key to having a No. 1 song." That type of marketing to get airplay can be a pricey proposition. Just ask Sarah Stennett, an A&R executive and manager who works with singers Ellie Goulding and Jessie J. There are plenty of songs that are good tunes, Stennett said, but "when you've got a record that works, you need a record label that will then work that record." But for a label to justify the expense of promoting an artist, the singer and song have to gel in a way that will connect with the audience, she said. "There are certain songs that just encapsulate all you need to know about an artist," Stennett said. "They are like personality records. For instance, 'Get the Party Started' by Pink. It was a hit, but it also told you a great deal about who Pink was as an artist." Stennett said the machine involved in promotion has to remain enthusiastic about the project. "Everyone has to be about the message," she said. "It's about spreading the message. Have you heard this song by ...?" Silvio Pietroluongo, director of charts for Billboard, said the conundrum the music industry faces is that while albums aren't selling nearly as well as before, the music is bigger than ever. "I think music is more popular and accessible today than it's ever been," he said. "It's a major component of advertising campaigns, sporting events and anything multimedia." That means the industry now has varying degrees of success, he said, from an artist such as Adele, whom he calls "lightning in the bottle" able to sell both singles and albums, to some such as Jepsen, who has sold millions of singles but not as many albums. Pietroluongo said any artist is one hit away from that big break or even a comeback. But today's hit can easily come from performers such as Flo Rida, who, Pietroluongo said, is one of the all-time, top-selling digital download artists despite a lack of recognition as a hitmaker. "They are catchy tracks," Pietroluongo said of the rapper's music. "I think the challenge with Flo Rida has been to put a face with the hits. I'm not sure if you locked 10 people in a room that half of them would realize that all the songs they love are Flo Rida." Producer Blanco is also not easily recognizable, though he may increasingly be responsible for some of the most played music out these days. The process of putting it all together is as much fun as work, he said. It often starts with a roomful of friends and lots of food. He likes to write with friends, he said, since as soon as he writes anything he usually shares it with them anyway. And a hit could occur while he's chilling in a hot tub or taking a walk: anything as long as the ideas keep flowing. "I let the song come to me," he said. "Then that thing comes to you, and you just know what that thing is. Music isn't like a 9-to-5 job. You never know. It's just the most unpredictable thing."
Spanish international striker David Villa suffered a broken leg as European Champions Barcelona brushed aside Qatari side Al Sadd 4-0 Thursday to reach the final of the FIFA Club World Cup. Villa fractured his left tibia while trying to latch on to an Andres Iniesta through ball after 34 minutes of the semifinal clash in Japan's Toyota City and was carried off on a stretcher. Spanish champions Barca will come up against Santos in Sunday's final after the Brazilian team beat Japan's Kashiwa Reysol 3-1 Wednesday. Barca sealed their comprehensive victory with a brace from full-back Adriano and strikes from Mali's Seydou Keita and Brazilian Maxwell. Santos cruise into Club World Cup final Villa was restored to the starting line-up by coach Pep Guardiola having recently lost his place in the team to Alexis Sanchez, with the Chilean preferred for last weekend's "El Clasico" victory over archrivals Real Madrid. Sanchez arrived from Udinese in July, but saw the start of his Barca career hampered by a hamstring injury. The 22-year-old's recovery and return to the first team has prompted speculation over Villa's future with the Catalan giants. The 30-year-old has found the net just five times in 15 Spanish La Liga appearances this season and now faces a lengthy period on the sidelines. A later statement on the Barcelona official website confirmed the bad news: "Villa will return to Barcelona, via Frankfurt, to be operated on. He will be accompanied by doctor Ricard Pruna and Manel Estiarte. The approximate time he will be sidelined is between four and five months." Barca coach Guardiola added: : "He will be greatly missed as a colleague and as a player. I hope everything goes well. "He will be out for a long time. It's a big blow to the team. We just hope that he can play again as soon as possible." In that time frame, Villa could also face a race against time to be fit to take his place for Spain as they defend their title at Euro 2012 in Ukraine and Poland in June. Barca never looked like losing to Asian Champions League winners Al Sadd and took the lead when Adriano pounced on an error by goalkeeper Mohamed Saqr to bundle the ball home after 25 minutes. CNN Blog: Is Roberto Mancini the right man for Man City? Adriano doubled his and Barca's tally two minutes before half time, latching onto Thiago's pass to hammer his shot beyond a helpless Saqr. The second half continued in the same vein as the first, with Barca dominant. The third goal arrived with 26 minutes to go, Argentina star Lionel Messi slipping a perfect pass through for Keita to finish. Spain midfielder Thiago was once again involved in the fourth and final goal, the 20-year-old playing in Maxwell who fired a shot into the bottom corner. Barca will be looking to claim the title for the second time in three years, having beaten Argentina's Estudiantes to the crown in 2009.
Struggling to make ends meet, trying to dig themselves out of debt, Nicole Thompson-Arce and her husband have moved in with her ex-husband. Together, the unlikely threesome of Omaha, Nebraska, is raising two young daughters from the first marriage. It's the kind of situation that has left cable guys howling. "They'd never heard anything like this," Thompson-Arce, 28, remembered with a laugh. "And they're in people's homes everyday." When she and Craig Thompson, 42, were going through a divorce in 2005, this was not a deal either of them could have imagined striking. It was a messy divorce, the kind involving a custody dispute. But once they ironed out that battle, agreeing to joint custody, Thompson-Arce said they were able to move on and forward. iReport: Read Thompson-Arce's post By the time she married Mathew Arce last July, she said she and her ex were friends. In fact, they were so close that his mother -- meaning Thompson-Arce's ex-mother-in-law -- was in (not just at) the second wedding ceremony. Soon after the Florida wedding, the new lovebirds flew into a financial mess. She had left a job, and as soon as she found another (a temp position), her 22-year-old husband was fired from his higher-paying gig. iReport.com: Job hunt stories They fell behind in rent. The bills stacked up. The credit card debt grew. iReport.com: What are you cutting from budget? A couple months later, Arce, landed a temporary Wal-Mart cashier position, which has since turned into a full-time job. But finances remained shaky and digging themselves out of debt seemed insurmountable. Tell us how you're surviving in this economy In walked the ex with an offer, just in time for Christmas. Thompson, an 18-year bakery employee at Wal-Mart, lives in a three-bedroom, one-bath home. "I knew they were having money problems, so I just asked them to move in," he said. "I figured I'd get to see my girls, my daughters, more often. And Nicole said yes right away." Besides the economic savings, the benefits are many. No longer do they have to shuttle Victoria, 7, and Caitlyn, 6, between two households. As a team, they can parent and be on the same page. Finding a baby sitter is never a problem. They take turns making meals, which they all share. Thompson and Arce, who are 20 years apart -- "I had to get the whole spectrum going there," Thompson-Arce joked -- have become the best of friends, and share a similar sense of humor. They have tackled home improvement projects, run around together on days they both have off and often hang out at the kitchen table building plastic models. "We just clicked," Thompson said. "When I tell people, 'I'm living with my ex-wife and her husband,' I get some really strange looks. ...It's different. It's unusual, but it works." The transition has been smooth and great for the kids, Thompson-Arce said. And for their benefit, irrespective of finances, she thinks it's a living situation they'll stick with for at least five to 10 years. It has, however, taken a little time for the little ones to get the story straight. Seven-year-old Victoria went back to school after winter break -- and after the whole team had blended under one roof -- and started telling people this: " 'My mommy has two husbands,'" Thompson-Arce remembered. "I was like, 'No, honey, don't tell them that!'" What she and both men hope the girls are learning is that divorced parents can work together and be friends. "There are so many families that go through divorce and can never let it go," she said. "I'm thankful, and hopefully our situation can help people rethink things because if they have kids, it's in their best interest to get along." One might wonder whether the couple, who've been married for less than a year, get enough time alone together, given where they're living. Thompson-Arce points out that her ex works a shift that sends him to bed at 7 p.m., so the evenings -- after the kids are asleep -- are for her and her husband to share.  Watch restaurant holds date night event » "When they do have a romantic evening, I don't hear them, so we're not going there," Thompson quipped. "There's a bathroom between our two bedrooms." The ex-husband hasn't dated since the divorce. He said it's because he's been focused on work and taking care of the kids. Thompson-Arce, however, said that she and her husband are forever trying to get Thompson on the dating scene and want him to meet someone special. Special, and understanding, she would most definitely need to be. "He'd have to find a very open-minded woman because we don't plan on going anywhere anytime soon," Thompson-Arce said.
Few issues divide the Supreme Court -- and the country at large -- more than church-state matters, and arguments before the Supreme Court on Wednesday involving a workplace discrimination lawsuit against a Lutheran church proved especially touchy. At issue is whether the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to hiring and firing decisions involving "ministerial employees" like teachers who may have primarily secular job duties. The justices appeared at odds over whether this is substantive discrimination or simple retaliation against a Michigan teacher, after she complained to government authorities over her treatment on the job. "You're asking for an exemption (to lawsuits) so these issues can't even be tried" in a government hearing on the merits, said Justice Anthony Kennedy. "She was fired simply for asking for a hearing." "It's none of the business of the government to decide what the substantial interest of the church is," countered Justice Antonin Scalia. "There, in black and white in the text of the Constitution, are special protections for religion." Court records show Cheryl Perich went on medical leave for narcolepsy in 2004. When she tried to return several months later to the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School, officials refused to accept her, saying a substitute had been hired to complete the school year. After weeks of often acrimonious discussions between her and the school, Perich was fired for insubordination and "regrettable" conduct toward church leaders. She then complained to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sued the church on her behalf. Federal courts have upheld an exception in the Americans with Disabilities Act blocking government intrusion in the employment decisions between religious institutions and ministerial workers. The church said Perich was just such an employee and therefore the institution could not be sued. Perich had been hired five years earlier, and eventually became a "called" teacher, meaning she could not be fired without cause. Assigned to third and fourth grades, she led instruction in math, language arts, social studies, gym and music, with much of the curriculum identical to that of the local public schools. Perich also taught a religion class four days a week, and engaged in daily prayers and devotionals with her students. The religion-based activities typically took up about 45 minutes of the seven-hour school day, according to court documents. She also led chapel services with her class twice a year, on a rotation basis with other instructors. The faculty has two types of teachers: "lay" employees, who are on one-year contracts, and called teachers like Perich, who have completed a formal colloquy, receiving a certificate of admission into the teaching ministry. Those parochial instructors are hired on an open-ended basis and cannot be summarily dismissed without proper justification. Perich began as a contract teacher, but fulfilled the requirements to be a called teacher, becoming a "commissioned minister" in the Lutheran Church. Perich attended the one-hour oral arguments at the high court, saying afterward, "I can't fathom how the Constitution in any way can be interpreted to deny me my fundamental rights. I hope the court sees it that way." The Redford, Michigan, school is affiliated with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, but does not require its teachers to be called, or even Lutheran. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati eventually ruled for Perich, saying her primary duties as a teacher were not religious in nature. In the oral arguments at the high court, Douglas Laycock, representing the church, said, "Government does not set the criteria for selecting and removing officers of the church. That's a bedrock principle." Justice Sonia Sotomayor jumped in. "Doesn't society have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable," and deserving of government intervention. "We know from the news recently that there was a church whose religious beliefs centered around sexually exploiting women and, I believe, children." She added, "Once we say that's unacceptable, can and why shouldn't we protect (from retaliation) the people who are doing what the law requires, i.e. reporting it?" Arguing for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Justice Department lawyer Leondra Kruger said, "The government's interest in this case is not in dictating to the church-operated school who it may choose to teach religion classes and who it may not. It is one thing and one thing only, which is to tell the school that it may not punish its employees for threatening to report civil wrongs to civil authorities." Chief Justice John Roberts was incredulous. "You're making a judgment about how important a particular religious belief is to a church," he told Kruger. "You're saying: We don't believe the Lutheran Church when it says that this is an important and central tenet of our faith." Kruger later suggested the government could not bring action against the Catholic Church for its historic policy of men-only priests, but that retaliation claims against the Lutheran Church in this case are justified. But Justice Samuel Alito said any such lawsuit would invariably involve questions of religious doctrine, from which religious groups would be constitutionally insulated from any claims. "I can't reconcile your position on those two issues without coming to the conclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is older, stronger and entitled to more respect than the Lutheran doctrine," he said. The Constitution's First Amendment bars any government from passing laws "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The high court in the past has typically dealt with such church-state disputes by allowing Ten Commandment displays in public buildings; the mention of "God" on currency and in the Pledge of Allegiance; manger and menorah displays in public parks; and school and legislature prayer. Legal experts say federal courts have been split on the current issue, and it gives the justices a rare opportunity to explore a religious freedom dispute from an employment context. Several dozen supporting briefs supporting both sides have been filed by religious and civil liberty organizations, employment groups, and eight other states. Six members of the high court are Catholic, the other three are Jewish. The case is Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC (10-553). A ruling is expected early next year.

then Barbara Thomas -- started her career as a star law student at New York University with a drive to succeed inherited from her mother. "Originally, when I told my mother I wanted to be an actress she said that we didn't need any starving actresses in the family, and, if I wanted to act, I should do it in front of a jury and become a lawyer," she said. "My mother was the smartest person I know and she fundamentally believed that women should have a career to offer them the opportunity to be independent." Judge's graduation coincided with a push to get more women into big, American law firms and with her top grades, she was able to secure several offers. "I worked extremely hard, often until 3am, but it paid off as I became a partner in my law firm by the time I was 31," she said. At the age of 33, Judge became the youngest ever commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). "That was the big break that changed my life," she said. Also on Leading Women: The British-born artist who became one of India's leading talents While at the SEC, Judge had her son, Lloyd Thomas, and took only 12 days off work, returning on day 13 to give a speech to 200 brokers. "My mother always told me that as long as you have good childcare, you could have a career -- in fact, a good job was harder to find than a good nanny," she said. "I have a wonderful relationship with my son and he is proud of the fact that I worked full time, even when he was young. "You can have a serious career and also be a serious mother." In 1983, after three years at the SEC, Judge's first husband relocated to Hong Kong, so she got a job as the first woman director of a British merchant bank, Samuel Montague & Co, to join him in what was then a British territory. "It was very much a boys' club and it was difficult to be accepted, particularly as an American woman trained as a lawyer, not a banker." Thirty years on, Judge is still working at the same furious pace and gets up before 5.30am every day to work before breakfast. She plans to take after her mother, who did not retire from her job as a university associate dean until the age of 87. The owner of a resume littered with firsts -- rising to the top of a man's world in the 1970s and 80s -- Judge will inevitably be described as a pioneer for women. "I feel more like a pioneer now than I did when it was happening," she said. "I never really thought of myself as a 'woman' in the context of my professional life,  I only thought I was a 'person.'" "The real pioneer was my mother."
For desperately ill patients with serious, life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections, access to new antibiotics is a matter of life and death. All across America, people are dying from bacterial infections that we used to be able to cure with antibiotics. Just this March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned the public about a four-fold increase in one group of "nightmare bacteria," carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which kills up to 50% of the people infected, and is on the rise. The annual impact of antibiotic resistant infections on the U.S. health care system is estimated to be $21 billion to $34 billion in excess health care costs and more than 8 million additional hospital days. At the same time, we are not making new antibiotics fast enough to prevent these deaths. Without new antibiotics, things we all take for granted, including surgery, chemotherapy, organ transplantation and premature infant care, will be in jeopardy. A streamlined but targeted approach that speeds regulatory approval of new antibiotics -- and limits their use to the sickest of the sick -- is an appropriate way to balance the safety risks of these new drugs with the lifesaving benefits they can offer patients who have no other treatment options. As a practicing infectious disease physician, my colleagues and I are seeing firsthand the devastating effects that resistant infections have on patients. Consider Addie Rerecich, who was a healthy, athletic 11-year-old in 2011 before she spent five months in an Arizona hospital battling several serious drug-resistant infections that her doctors did not have antibiotics powerful enough to treat. Addie ultimately needed a double lung transplant to save her life. The health care costs from her hospital stay alone totaled $6 million, and she will need medical attention and therapy for the rest of her life. As resistant infections like those that nearly took Addie's life continue to increase, the antibiotic pipeline is nearly dry, with few drugs in development that will work against the most alarming pathogens our patients face. A proposal from the Infectious Diseases Society of America aims to address a key part of the problem by reducing the obstacles to regulatory approval of new antibiotics for use in a distinct, narrow group of people: Patients with serious resistant infections that have no effective treatment options left. How will this make a difference? The current regulatory environment in the U.S. discourages drug companies from antibiotic research and development, and few firms are active in this area today. Antibiotics also aren't as profitable as other drugs, such as those for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes, which patients often take for years. A more direct path for regulatory approval can encourage more companies to get involved in antibiotic development again. IDSA's approach -- the Limited Population Antibacterial Drug -- would speed patients' access to new, lifesaving antibiotics by allowing the Food and Drug Administration to approve them for narrow use based on smaller clinical trials than required for more widely used antibiotics. Under LPAD, drug companies will still have to show that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks in patients with serious infections. It's an idea modeled after the successful Orphan Drug Program, which encourages the development of drugs for rare diseases. Promoting the appropriate use of these new antibiotics is critical, because we know antibiotic misuse and overuse are significant drivers of drug resistance. Special labeling will ensure narrow marketing of these drugs. Educational efforts should be put in place to send a strong signal to health care providers, facilities and insurers that these drugs are only for patients who need them most. These drugs will also likely be priced higher, commensurate with their value as life-saving medicines, than traditionally approved antibiotics, another factor that will help limit their wider use. Antibiotic stewardship programs, which encourage appropriate antibiotic use by providers and health facilities, will play a key role. These programs provide much needed support and guidance to clinicians and ensure that our precious resource of antibiotics will be used wisely. Professional medical groups -- including the American Medical Association -- public health organizations, patient groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers have voiced their support for IDSA's proposal. FDA and several members of Congress are also interested in the concept and in moving it forward. To be sure, developing new antibiotics and speeding their approval process to treat seriously ill patients is just one way to grapple with this complex public health crisis. IDSA also promotes enhanced public health efforts, including better data collection and surveillance of drug resistance and the use of antibiotics, improved infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and stronger efforts to encourage the appropriate use of antibiotics in humans and on the farm. Increased research funding to explore how antibiotic resistance develops and spreads is just as vital, along with additional economic incentives and regulatory clarity to boost antibiotic development. Patients like Addie need our help. We must take action now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Helen Boucher.
At least 12 people, mostly women, were killed and 47 others were wounded in Somalia's capital city, Mogadishu, after Islamists and African Union forces exchanged shells Thursday, an ambulance service official said. "I can confirm that at least 12 people died in today's fighting and we have collected 47 others who got wounded," said Ali Musa, director of an ambulance service who spoke to CNN from Mogadishu. "At one site, a shell landed on women selling milk and a number of them got killed and wounded." Exclusive: Somalia battles measure success in meters Musa said the shelling began in the morning with Islamist rebels firing mortars at Somalia's parliament building, where lawmakers were in session. The exchange of shells continued until 3:20 in the afternoon, Musa said.
"Media must cease reporting on the discovery of a body at a psychiatric hospital in Dongguan." "Media must not report on corruption allegations relating to the eldest son of President Hu Jintao." "Media must not report on a lawsuit against China Eastern Airlines by victims of a plane crash in 2004 in which 52 passengers were killed." Those are just a few of more than 60 restrictions the Chinese government slapped on the media in 2009, often secretly, according to the International Federation of Journalists. The press freedom group said it obtained written media-related orders which are published in its report, "China Clings to Control: Press Freedoms in 2009." Tight controls were put on reporting of ethnic riots in the west of the country in July, and clear orders were issued for how to report President Barack Obama's visit to the country in November, the IFJ said in the report released Sunday. The press was instructed not to organize questions for the public to ask Obama at a town-hall style event he did in the country and was banned from reporting on "protests or spontaneous news during Obama's visit," the IFJ report said. It all added up to a year of increased censorship in China, on the heels of a period of relative openness around the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the group charged. CNN's calls to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Washington were not immediately returned. The IFJ report said that Chinese media were ordered not to report prominently on protests in Iran following the country's controversial presidential election in June. They were barred from reporting at all on elections for the chief executive of Macau, a region of China, and were waved off stories about refugees entering China, threats to public health, political protests and corruption, the report said. They were allowed to report about some stories in English but not Mandarin, and others in newspapers but not online, said the report, which was compiled with the help of a group called Chinese Human Rights Defenders. That's not to mention self-censorship in the press around two key anniversaries last year: the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests and the Tibetan uprising of 1959, the IFJ said. "Media did not need to be ordered how to report these matters -- they were very aware there was to be no independent reporting on these topics," the report said. "Most journalists and media outlets would self-censor and there would be no need for regulations or orders... self-censorship remains a matter of self-preservation." Direct orders from the government -- sometimes containing the explicit threat of "punishment from the Central Propaganda Department" -- was only one element in Beijing's arsenal against the press, the report said. China is clearly concerned about the Internet, the IFJ suggested. "Online surveillance was stepped up, Web sites were entirely or partially closed, online social networks were shut down, online news portals were censored, online journalists and bloggers were detained and arrested." Press "accreditation rules tightened further in 2009... making it difficult for online journalists to gain accreditation," the report said. And foreign journalists encountered "acts of violence, destruction of work materials and equipment... surveillance and reprimands," the report said. But "despite the difficulties, many journalists try to go out of the way to get the news," the IFJ said. China hosted a World Media Summit in October, drawing the heads of some of the world's largest news organizations, including the Associated Press, Reuters, News Corporation, Russia's Itar-Tass, Kyodo of Japan and China's own Xinhua. President Hu addressed the conference, saying "it is more important than ever before that the media should establish and uphold social responsibilities," according to Xinhua. Hu pledged the Chinese government would safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of foreign news media and continue to facilitate foreign media coverage of China in accordance with the law, Xinhua reported. It is not clear that he made a similar promise regarding Chinese media. Obama criticized censorship in his November visit to China, responding to questions from the Chinese public about restrictions on the Internet. "Because in the United States information is free, and I have a lot of critics in the United States who can say all kinds of things about me, I actually think that that makes our democracy stronger and it makes me a better leader because it forces me to hear opinions that I don't want to hear," he said. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on China to investigate alleged hacking of Google in the country -- prompting the Internet search giant to threaten to pull out of China. "We look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent," Clinton said. Five years ago, Google agreed to allow some censorship by China, in exchange for the right to operate in that country's massive emerging technology market. The company now says censorship and the hacking of Chinese dissidents' Google e-mail accounts have prompted it to reconsider. The IFJ calls itself "a non-governmental, non-profit organization that promotes coordinated international action to defend press freedom and social justice through the development of strong, free and independent trade unions of journalists."
Back in the mid-1960s, a Palestinian guerrilla group called Fatah -- the Conquest -- began launching cross-border attacks against Israeli civilians. Sponsored by Syria and led by Palestinian activists, among them the young Mahmoud Abbas, Fatah aroused admiration throughout the Arab world. So much so that Egypt, then Syria's rival, formed its own group and called it the Palestine Liberation Organization -- the PLO -- which also staged attacks into Israel. The Israelis wouldn't sit passively, though, but struck back at Fatah's Syrian hosts, who in turn shelled Israeli villages. Not to be outdone, Egypt in May 1967 evicted U.N. peacekeeping forces from the Sinai Peninsula and amassed troops along Israel's border. This precipitated an Israeli pre-emptive strike against Egypt which, within hours, ensnarled Syria and even Jordan. Six days later, Israeli troops controlled the territories, whose final status remains bitterly unresolved. Recalling the background to the Six-Day War -- a conflict almost nobody wanted and even fewer anticipated -- is crucial today in the face of a frightfully similar process unfolding along Israel's southern border. If left unchecked, the rising violence in Gaza could quickly spiral uncontrollably. Another conflagration, no more desired or foreseen than that of 1967, could once again engulf the Middle East. Though Fatah and the PLO merged long ago and are now headed by Mahmoud Abbas, who has since forsworn terror, other Palestinian groups are vying for power. By attacking Israel, they gain credibility in the Palestinian street and prestige throughout the region. One such group was Hamas, a wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, that violently expelled Abbas' men from Gaza in 2007 and proceeded to fire thousands of rockets at Israel. Still not passive, Israel retaliated with punishing operations in Gaza in 2008 and 2012. Those blows, together with the Brotherhood's fall from power in Egypt, subdued Hamas, but now another Gaza organization has risen to challenge it. Islamic Jihad has been firing rockets and aiming ground attacks at Israel. Characteristically, the Israelis responded with force and earlier this week killed three Islamic Jihad operatives engaged in mounting a strike. The terrorists then fired some 50 rockets and mortar shells at southern Israeli towns, spurring Israeli fighter jets to bomb 29 targets in Gaza. (An Islamic Jihad leader told CNN on Thursday a truce had been declared, but the Israeli government has not commented.) But Israel regards Hamas as the sovereign authority in Gaza and holds it ultimately responsible for any attacks emanating from there, even those conducted by Islamic Jihad. If the rocket fire and shelling continue, Israel is likely to retaliate against Hamas, which could be dragged, however unwillingly, into the fighting. Islamic Jihad is funded and armed by Iran. Just last week, Israeli naval commandos intercepted a cargo ship -- the Klos-C -- carrying 400,000 bullets and 40 rockets capable of hitting Tel Aviv. Made in Iran, the arms would have enabled Islamic Jihad to join with Hezbollah, Iran's chief proxy in Lebanon, to rocket every Israeli city. The goal is to deter Israel from striking Iran's nuclear facilities and to paralyze it with multiple existential threats. But what if Iran -- much like Egypt in 1967 -- miscalculated? What could happen if an Israeli reprisal for Islamic Jihad's rockets results in a confrontation between Israel and Hamas? Would Hezbollah then join the clash, unleashing its arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets against the Jewish state, and would Israeli forces have to invade Lebanon to stop them? Would Iran watch idly while its closest Middle East ally was crushed by the "Zionist enemy," or would it, too, leap into the fray? Gaza remains a combat zone as of this writing, and rocket alert sirens are wailing in southern Israeli cities. As in previous exchanges, a de facto cease-fire might be worked out and relative calm restored to the region. Or the confrontation could widen, and what began as a skirmish could inexorably expand into war. As the example of 1967 reminds us, a single spark in the combustible Middle East can swiftly fan a flare-up into a firestorm.

Protests planned around Egypt -- particularly in Cairo's Tahrir Square -- on the second anniversary of the January 25 revolution are expected to be an explosion of dissent, revealing the deep divisions in the country between President Mohamed Morsy and the Egyptian people. Opposition to Morsy's authoritarianism is broader than the world recognizes. In making accommodations for Morsy's government, the United States is -- once again -- out of step with the Egyptian people. Egyptians may not know exactly what they want, but they know what they don't want. Although an effective political opposition has yet to coalesce, Egyptians from all sectors of society are united in their refusal to accept another repressive regime. Egypt is on a collision course. An ever growing, if periodically discouraged, portion of the population opposes the government and Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood, and supports the revolution's goals of social and economic justice, accountable government, and basic freedoms, including freedom of expression and protection of minorities. Yet the government is moving in exactly the opposite direction, with its authoritarian control over political, social, and religious life. The government's investigation of the wildly popular "Egyptian Jon Stewart" Bassem Youssef -- charged with insulting Morsy and undermining his command -- and the forced "retirement" of respected journalist Hani Shukrallah, editor of state-owned Al-Ahram's English-language website, are just two very public examples of the vice tightening on freedom of expression. In fact, the Arab Network for Human Rights says about 24 lawsuits for insulting Morsy have been filed against journalists and activists since his election in June. The regime is trying to put the revolution genie back in the bottle. But it is clamping down on a population that has discovered its voice. In opposition to this repression, Egyptians at all levels are increasingly engaged in politics. A Cairo cab driver -- ever the measure of popular sentiment -- recently debated the failings of the Constitution with a passenger. After reaching the destination, the driver leapt out, grabbed a dogeared copy of the Constitution he kept in the front seat, and pointed to a passage to prove his point to his passenger. The December demonstrations against President Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood-backed Constitution, which attracted an even broader segment of the population than those who stood in Tahrir Square in 2011, revealed the broadening chasm between the regime and the people in Egypt. Assembled outside the Presidential Palace were old and young, veiled and unveiled, rich and poor. Whether they arrived in chauffeur-driven cars or whether they marched from Cairo's outlying shantytowns, the hundreds of thousands joined together in their refusal to accept a state that squashed the dreams of the revolution and dictated political, social, and religious behavior. Many call the second wave of the revolution in the fall of 2012 the "Mothers' Revolution." Parents and grandparents went into the streets to protest the divided loyalties in their families between the Islamists (Brotherhood or Salafis) and those supporting a democratic, secular Egypt. In Egypt, secular means freedom from state control of religion, not nonreligious. The clash between these two visions of Egypt -- secular with freedom and social justice, or a religious state run by the Brotherhood with its version of Sharia law -- played out inside families and on the streets. Soldiers protecting the Presidential Palace during the December demonstrations were moved to tears when an Egyptian woman, referring to Morsy, shouted at them, "Why are you protecting this man who is pitting Egyptians against each other?" Mohamed El Gindy, a successful businessman who opposes Morsy and spent much of December camping in Tahrir with the young revolutionaries, has experienced this division within families firsthand. A relative who had joined the Salafis informed him that the extreme Islamist group had put El Gindy at No. 5 on its "hit list," which is widely believed by Egyptians to exist. The relative was unapologetic until El Gindy told him that he might as well put El Gindy's mother on the list, too, since the octogenarian also had joined the street protests. Egypt and its families may be divided, but on one subject, all are united -- in the belief that the United States is supporting the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government. Visible in the throngs at the December demonstrations were signs opposing Qatar and the United States -- yes, the U.S. and Qatar were lumped together as supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood regime. "This is such a historic opportunity to restore the image of the U.S., but instead it is putting itself in the same position as Qatar. ... And this from President Obama -- so disappointing," Riham Bahi, a professor at American University in Cairo, said, reflecting views heard repeatedly last December in Egypt. Opposition leader and blogger Bassem Sabry was even more blunt: "With the Constitution in play, you are subsidizing an Islamist state." Sabry said he was always pro-U.S. "until the revolution." In addition, the Pentagon plans to proceed with the delivery of 20 F-16 jets to Egypt, a step that looks to Egyptians like a vote of confidence in Morsy. Unchanged since the revolution, U.S. aid policy toward Egypt still makes the military alliance its priority. Two years after the Egyptian Revolution, the U.S. government finds itself again backing an authoritarian regime against the popular will. As January 25 approaches, with massive protests planned against Morsy's government, this is a precarious position for both the U.S. and Egypt. In his second term, Obama should adopt a more agile and informed policy toward Egypt, one that matches the words often heard from the White House -- "The United States always has stood with the Egyptian people" -- with action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Schneider.
Residents in several major East Coast cities -- including Washington, Philadelphia and New York -- braced late Saturday for the impact from Hurricane Irene. By Saturday evening, the storm had already knocked out power in more than a million homes, forced more than a million people off the New Jersey shore alone and caused at least nine deaths. Irene weakened somewhat since coming ashore early Saturday near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and it is expected to slowly lose more strength overnight. But it is still a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds around 80 mph and extending 85 miles from its center. Forecasters expect it to remain a hurricane until it once again makes landfall Sunday afternoon in southern New England. While the vast majority heeded calls to evacuate, emergency officials continued to plead with some stubborn residents to head to high ground, warning that heavy rains and a storm surge of 4 to 8 feet could cause widespread flooding of low-lying areas and pose untold dangers to residents from Virginia to Massachusetts. "Living in New York City all my life and never experiencing a hurricane before, I have no idea what to expect," said CNN iReporter Elie Shaby, who lives one block north of where authorities have ordered evacuations in Manhattan. Five people died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and three were killed in Virginia due to falling trees, emergency officials said. In addition, a 55-year-old male surfer died around noon in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, said Capt. Tamara Marris, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County Beach Patrol. As of 11 p.m., Irene was 70 miles south-southwest of Ocean City, Maryland, moving north-northeast at 16 mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane already had brought 10 to 14 inches of rain to much of North Carolina and was pushing a 4-foot storm surge into the Chesapeake Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane warnings extend up the coast to Cape Cod in Massachusetts, with tropical storm warnings issued for parts of coastal Canada. Reports of tornadoes came from several states, including Virginia and North Carolina. Ed Schaeffer, a spokesman for the Lewes, Delaware, fire department, said between 30 and 40 homes have been damaged -- five of them severely -- though there have been no injuries. "It's pretty tough, honestly," Delaware Gov. Jack Markell said of conditions Saturday night. "So far, it's still early for us and it's already hitting us pretty hard." A tornado in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, destroyed five homes and seriously damaged a business Saturday, Sheriff Darryl Liverman told CNN affiliate WITN. Vance County authorities published photos of a home damaged when a tree fell on it and crashed through a bedroom ceiling. It was unclear if anyone was injured. The National Weather Service issued tornado watches -- indicating favorable conditions  for a tornado to form, even when one hasn't been reported yet -- through Sunday morning for several areas, including New Jersey and New York City. U.S. Coast Guard Adm. William Lee, who tracked the storm by air, said he believed Saturday night the worst fears for Irene had not yet come to fruition. "All in all, the damage wasn't nearly as bad as we expected," Lee told CNN. "I've been through several hurricanes and, in comparison to ones like Frederick, Andrew and Hugo, this one (has had) significantly less damage." As it passed through North Carolina, Irene ripped off roofs and caused other damage to homes and businesses in Hyde and Jones counties, toppled trees that blocked roads and brought down power lines statewide, according to the state emergency management division. "We're not seeing catastrophic damage, but there is massive flooding near the coast in some places," Brad Nieman of the state's emergency management division said Saturday evening. In Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina -- where a hotel facade, for instance, ripped away and fell into the ocean -- police and public works crews stopped responding to calls because of adverse conditions, the state emergency management division reported. More than half a million people in North Carolina had lost power as of 7 p.m. Saturday, and 5,000 people huddled overnight in 60 shelters around the state, said Brad Neiman from the state's emergency management division. "We're not seeing catastrophic damage, but there is massive flooding near the coast," Neiman said. "A lot we will figure out at first light (Sunday)." Authorities in communities across North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland announced curfews. Some banned the sale of alcohol. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter declared a state of emergency, telling residents to be prepared to go without power for up to two weeks. Boston has joined New York, New Jersey and the cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore in suspending all transit service, with no subway and bus service on Sunday. And the Philadelphia International Airport will remain closed until at least 4 p.m. Sunday, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. In Virginia, more than 600,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said. Officials warned people to be prepared to be without power for up to a week. In Newport News, Nate Morris -- a student at Christopher Newport University, about a mile from the ocean -- said he noticed numerous trees and power lines down. "There were times when you'd walk around or be in the house, and you couldn't hear anything because of the wind and rain," Morris told CNN on Saturday night. "And it sounds it like it will be a very hard night, too." More than 1 million people on the Jersey shore had joined untold numbers of others from the Carolinas to New England in moving inland or to higher ground, away from the storm's worst impacts, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said. Those who remained behind in communities where the storm has yet to hit are making a mistake believing that the storm is too weak to do any damage, said Craig Fugate, Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator. "Some of our most devastating floods have occurred in tropical storms," he said. The hold-outs included 92 residents of Atlantic City high-rises, many of them elderly, who refused pleas from Christie and others to get a free ride out of the danger zone. Mayor Lorenzo T. Langford told CNN on Saturday night that 94 of those inside had responded to the latest call by authorities to get out. "We've made three sweeps, the most recent sweep probably was the last one," Langford said, adding that about 90% of the city's residents had evacuated. "We've admonished them to leave when they could." In New York -- where the city ordered the unprecedented evacuation of 370,000 people from low-lying areas on Friday-- even residents who aren't being ordered to leave could face an arduous few days following Irene's tour of the city. The city's transit system, shut down Saturday, may not be fully running again until Monday at the earliest, high-rise buildings are being instructed to turn off elevators and utility ConEd may have to cut power to Manhattan, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. "This is a storm where, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, it can be fatal," he warned. CNN's Chris Boyette, Jeanne Meserve, Chris Lawrence, Greg Botelho, Jason Carroll, David Mattingly, John Zarrella, Kimberly Segal, Sarah Hoye, Kristina Sgueglia, Rafael Romo, Eden Pontz and Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.
Accepting my diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was probably the most difficult part of my MS journey. However, it also helped me retake control of my life. For years, I was in denial that I had MS. I thought if I didn't focus on my MS, then maybe it would just go away. It took the Nashville flood in May 2010 for me to "wake up" and decide it was time to take responsibility for what is, and what will be, my life with MS. My Mom, my sister and I lost our home and almost everything we owned in the flood. When we were rescued by boat, we were given another chance at life. I realized then that things can be replaced, but life and good health are invaluable. The stress from the flood brought on a relapse of my MS, which I could no longer ignore. At that point, I decided to accept that MS is part of who I am, and that I needed to learn how to manage it in order to continue living my dreams. I believe it was God who gave me another chance at life with the flood rescue and I wasn't going to waste it. I was determined to show this disease who was boss and that I would not let MS define my life's journey! I wanted to show the world that MS looks different for everyone and that MS does not mean you have to give up on your dreams. A diagnosis with any disease can be overwhelming, scary and confusing. Before, I, too, was scared and worried about how the world and the music industry would look at me if they knew I had MS. Would they judge me and stop booking me to sing places? Would I be able to continue playing shows? Would the dreams I'd been working toward my entire life be taken from me? If so, what else would I do? I can't say life is a piece of cake. Occasionally I still get asked whether my MS will interfere with my professional or personal life, but I respond every day by doing what I love. Can I continue to play my shows? Ask my fans who are there with me when I'm on tour around the world or playing a local nightspot. Can I write my songs? Listen to my current CD. Can I live a full and happy life? Come see the home I rebuilt after the flood. This doesn't mean I live my life in a haphazard way without a plan. I have developed a strong network of support, starting with my family. After hearing some positive things about my local MS Society chapter, I also reached out to it for information and found a mentor who has grown into a lifelong friend. I've learned to manage my MS by keeping all my options open. I have a neurologist who helps me control my MS with a disease-modifying therapy and address any symptoms that may appear. I am also much more than my MS and I manage my life through diet, exercise and my faith. I have learned that I do not have to give up on my dreams. I do still have the challenge of educating those within my professional field that MS won't stand in the way of performing concerts or being with my fans. It's a challenge I face head-on every day. I will continue to stand up for myself and those with MS and show the world that as people living with MS we can still do what we want to do.
Put your dog in a bow tie: weird but cute.  Dress your cat in a bear costume: odd, but let the kitty dream. Push your overweight dog in a stroller: ridiculous, but sweet. Give your dog a tattoo covering its entire stomach and pierce its ears with mini barbells: WAIT! The New York Legislature believes some pet obsessions have gone too far. A bill banning the piercing and tattooing of companion animals, the most common of which are cats and dogs, was unanimously passed in both chambers on Wednesday. The bill awaits signing by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. If Cuomo signs the bill, violators face possible fines or imprisonment. The legislation was initially introduced in 2011 when a groomer, Holly Crawford, of Sweet Valley, Pennsylvania, began marketing "Gothic kittens" on eBay. New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who represents Manhattan, introduced the legislation immediately after reading an article about the kittens, said Lauren Schuster, her chief of staff. The kittens were pierced down their entire back, according to Schuster. That practice was brought to the attention of law enforcement by the animal rights group PETA. The groomer was prosecuted and convicted in Pennsylvania. Court documents showed she was sentenced to six months of electronic home monitoring and a period of probation. Crawford did not return a CNN call seeking comment. Under the New York bill, tattooing is acceptable as a form of identification for animals or to indicate that a medical procedure has been done, but "not for design purposes." Animal advocates hope people will move to having pets "microchipped" instead. Last year, a North Carolina man came under fire for putting tattoos on his two dogs. Ernesto Rodriguez, a tattoo artist, said he put the intricate tattoos on the bellies of his dogs so they could be easily identified if they were lost, CNN affiliate WGHP-TV reported. New York's bill gained momentum in early March, when a Brooklyn resident tattooed his pitbull while it was having surgery to have its spleen removed. This was the "catalyst for [the bill] to move again," said Schuster. Response from the public and animal rights groups was immediate, said Schuster. "I think people have a natural knee jerk for something like this," she said. People began to ask the question, "This really happens?" said Schuster. Under the bill, piercing and tattooing of companion animals would only be allowed for medical or identification purposes and must be performed by a licensed veterinarian. While tattooing in the past has been used as a form of identification, PETA says it prefers the microchip because it is the most effective. "Under no circumstance should an animal be pierced," said Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigation for PETA. Nachminovitch calls the bill a "wonderful thing" even though this "should be common sense," she says. While many states have animal cruelty statues, this is the only ban she has heard of to legally ban the tattooing and piercing of companion animals.

Prosecutors on Thursday dropped a drug possession with intent to sell charge against a musician who was arrested earlier this year in connection with the heroin overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. In return, Robert Aaron Vineberg pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office. He will serve no jail time. Vineberg will be sentenced October 14 to five years of probation, forfeiture of $1,284 confiscated from his apartment after his arrest and 25 days of community service, said Joan Vollero, director of communications for the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Vineberg also will attend an outpatient drug treatment program. Vineberg, who is from Canada, could face immigration consequences in light of his felony plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, Vollero said. He was originally also charged with third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, which included intent to sell. Vineberg was among four people arrested in Manhattan in the days after Hoffman's death. Prosecutors said Vineberg had just under 50 small bags of heroin as well as packaging paraphernalia in his apartment during a raid. Additionally, 250 small bags of heroin were found in another of Vineberg's apartments in the same building, prosecutors said. Vineberg, 58, was found to have the actor's phone number stored in his phone, a law enforcement official told CNN. Calls to Vineberg's lawyer were not immediately returned. The guilty plea comes the same day that the city's health department released 2013 data showing that heroin overdose deaths have doubled since 2010 in New York City. The city's health department said that 77% of drug overdose deaths in 2013 involved an opioid, including opioid analgesics (prescription painkillers), methadone or heroin. "On average, there is more than one fatal opioid overdose a day," according to the release. How heroin kills you Man arrested in Hoffman case gets a no-jail deal
The future of science and technology sounds so promising.  Unprecedented advances in computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics, neuroscience and biotechnology hold the potential to radically transform our world for the better and create mass abundance for all. I sincerely want to believe in this techno-utopian vision of things to come, but my work as a police officer and global security strategist working in more than 70 countries around the world has taught me that there is a darker side to these emerging technologies. The criminal underground is highly innovative and often acts as an early adopter of emerging technologies. As a young police officer, I observed gang members and drug dealers using beepers and mobile phones, long before they were in common use by the general public.  Today, criminals are even building their own encrypted radio communications networks, such as the nationwide system developed by narco cartels in Mexico. Watch Marc Goodman's TED Talk Technology has made our world increasingly open, and for the most part that has huge benefits for society. Nevertheless, all of this openness may have unintended consequences. Take, for example, the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai, India. The perpetrators were armed with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. The lethal innovation was the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies, including smartphones, satellite imagery and night-vision goggles to locate additional victims and slaughter them. Moreover, the terrorists created their own operations center across the border in Pakistan, where they monitored global news broadcasts, online reporting and social media in real time, leveraging the public's photos, videos and social network updates to kill more people. TED.com: All your devices can be hacked The terrorists in the Mumbai incident even used search engines during their attack to identify individual hostages and to determine, based upon their backgrounds, who should live or and who should die.  These innovations gave terrorists unprecedented situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and the government. Newer forms of technology are also subject to criminal misuse.  Robots are becoming more commonplace, and international organized crime groups and terrorists have lost no time in deploying these technologies as part of their field operations. For example, drug traffickers in Latin America are using robotic submarines to deliver thousands of tons of cocaine annually to the United States. Last year, the FBI arrested a man in Boston who planned to use remote-controlled robotic aircraft packed with explosives to attack both the U.S. Pentagon and Capitol building.  In the future, as robots become more widely deployed, so too could their criminal use and exploitation. TED.com: How cyberattacks threaten real-world peace Advances in the life sciences means it is now possible to design DNA on a computer screen and send the DNA code to a "bio printer" for assembly. Our ability to reprogram DNA itself will undoubtedly lead to great advances in medicine, but the danger is that these same techniques can be used to modify viruses, like H5N1 influenza, to become more and more lethal, potentially affecting millions around the globe. To hackers, DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked. We are at the dawn of an exponentially advancing technological arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill. Though such battles have gone on since the beginning of time, what has changed is the pace of innovation. New technologies and capabilities are emerging so quickly, it becomes increasingly likely they will outpace the capabilities of public safety officials to respond.  The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. TED.com: A 21st century cyber-weapon Technology is proliferating at an exponential pace and despite law enforcement's best efforts, cybercrime grows unabated. In coming years, we will witness an explosion in the use of robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and synthetic biology. There is little to suggest police will be any more prepared for these emerging threats than they were for basic cyber crimes. Our current nation-based legal and policing paradigms have clearly not kept pace with the global threat. The paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism call for a shift to a more open and participatory form of law enforcement. Given the rapid acceleration of technological development, any system that relies on a small, elite force of highly trained government agents may be doomed to failure. Good people in the world far outnumber those with ill intentions. But criminals and terrorists have shown their ability to take up technological arms to harm the general populace. This calls for increased vigilance on the part of ordinary citizens. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us.

Hurricane Leslie was hundreds of miles away from Bermuda Wednesday, but forecasters said the slow-moving storm could pack powerful winds as it nears the British territory. Officials said plans were in place for the storm, but advised residents to prepare for the worst. "Leslie could be a historic storm for Bermuda as it is very large and forecast to intensify rapidly as it approaches," Bermuda's Emergency Measures Organization said in a statement. "The island could experience hurricane force winds for a sustained period of time, possibly up to two days." The Category 1 storm was about 460 miles (740 kilometers) south-southeast of Bermuda, moving north at 2 mph (4 kph) Wednesday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), the hurricane center said. It could become a Category 2 hurricane, packing winds of more than 96 mph, by Friday, the hurricane center said. Forecasters predict it could affect Bermuda this weekend. The latest forecast track predicts that the storm could be within 20 miles of the island by Sunday morning, officials in Bermuda said.
The Chicago Bears waived wide receiver Sam Hurd on Friday, two days after federal authorities arrested him on charges of conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine. Hurd, 26, was arrested Wednesday at a Chicago restaurant, where he accepted cocaine from an undercover U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. Authorities say he was trying to set up a drug distribution network in Chicago, having allegedly expressed interest in getting a supplier to sell him hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine and marijuana per week, and that Hurd was a target of a five-month investigation in Dallas, where he once played for the Cowboys. "We are very shocked about what we heard," Bears General Manager Jerry Angelo said Friday while announcing Hurd's release from the NFL team's roster. Hurd was freed from custody Friday after a judge in Chicago granted him a $100,000 cash bond, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago. His attorney, Brett Greenfield, said Hurd had waived his preliminary hearing, and that a grand jury will now decide whether to indict him. The case will be handled by a federal court in the northern district of Texas, where the criminal complaint was filed this week. Greenfield said Hurd's frame of mind is confident, and that there is a "very high level of relief" that he is out of custody. The complaint says that Hurd met with an ICE undercover agent at a restaurant in Chicago on Wednesday night. A confidential informant with whom Hurd had communicated previously also attended the meeting, according to the complaint. He was interested in buying 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine, at $25,000 per kilogram, and 1,000 pounds of marijuana at $450 per pound, per week for distribution in the Chicago area, according to ICE. Hurd said that "he and another co-conspirator currently distribute about 4 kilograms of cocaine per week in Chicago, but that his supplier couldn't supply him with enough quantity," Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. After they finished negotiating, Hurd accepted a kilogram of cocaine from the undercover agent, according to the complaint. "Hurd stated that he plays for the Chicago Bears and that he gets out of practice at about 5:30 p.m., after which he would make arrangements to pay for the kilogram of cocaine," ICE officials said in a news release. "Hurd left the restaurant with the bag of cocaine and was arrested shortly thereafter in the parking lot of the restaurant." If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. Hurd, a sixth-year NFL player out of Northern Illinois University, joined the Bears in July after playing with the Cowboys for five seasons. Angelo, the Bears' general manager, said Friday that team research on Hurd turned up no red flags before he signed in July, according to the Bears' website. "We spend an inordinate amount of time on character, making sure we know the player as well as we can," Angelo said. "But no system is foolproof. For me to sit here and say that we should have known something that we didn't know, I can't say that in this case. There's no foundation for anybody to say that." NFL wide receiver Terrell Owens also expressed shock after hearing of Hurd's arrest. "It would never cross my mind that Sam would ever be dealing or using drugs," said Owens of his former Dallas Cowboys teammate. "This is completely out of character for him." Though Hurd has only eight catches for 109 yards in this season's first 13 games, he contributed in other ways. He has long been a special teams force, leading the Cowboys in special teams tackles in 2009 and 2010. CNN's Karan Olson, Jim Barnett, Bill Kirkos and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.
So you're ready to go. You've booked your flight, arranged your accommodation and booked a rental car. Awaiting is a week of motoring through Italy's magical countryside. But what's it really like to drive in Italy? Is it as nerve-wracking as it's made out to be? Do you need the skills of a Formula One driver to cut it on the nation's dog-eat-dog superstrade? Certainly, driving in Italy's main cities can be a white-knuckle experience but head out to the country and you'll find that the pace slackens and the roads are a lot less stressful. To help you on your way here are some insights based on years of experience and tens of thousands of kilometers. Lonely Planet: Italy for honeymooners Driving styles Italian drivers are fast, aggressive and skillful. Lane hopping and late braking are the norm and it's not uncommon to see cars tailgating at 130km/h. Don't expect people to slow down for you or let you out. Rather, seize the moment. As soon as you see a gap, go for it. Italians expect the unexpected and react swiftly but they're not used to ditherers so whatever you do, do it decisively. Road etiquette Much driving etiquette is dictated by unwritten rules. Flashing, for example, means 'Get out of the way' or 'Don't pull out 'coz I'm not stopping'. But if an approaching car flashes you, it's warning you that there's a police check ahead. Similarly, the car horn can mean everything from 'Watch out' to 'Ciao' to 'Let's celebrate, the traffic light's just turned green'. City challenges When driving in cities watch out for traffic restrictions. Many city centers are off-limits to unauthorized traffic and if you slip into a ZTL (zona a traffico limitato -- reduced traffic zone) you risk being caught on camera and fined. City driving also involves dealing with one-way systems, scooters appearing out of nowhere and narrow streets better suited to horse-drawn chariots than modern cars. To escape the worst mayhem, drive in the early afternoon when traffic is at its lightest and parking is easier. Which brings us to... Parking Parking is a major headache. Space is at a premium in towns and cities and Italy's traffic wardens are annoyingly efficient. Car parks do exist but they usually fill up quickly, leaving you to park on the streets. If you park between blue lines make sure to get a ticket from the nearest meter (coins only) or tabaccaio (tobacconist) and display it on your dashboard. Note, however, that charges don't apply overnight, typically between 8pm and 8am. Lonely Planet: Driving Burgundy's Route des Grands Cru Petrol stations You'll find filling stations all over but smaller ones tend to close between about 1pm and 3.30pm and on Sunday afternoons. This isn't as irritating as it might sound as many have self-service (fai da te) pumps that you can use any time. Simply insert a bank note into the payment machine and press the number of the pump you want. Remembering, of course, to distinguish between benzina (petrol) and gasolio (diesel). What to carry in the car Apart from your driving license, car documents, insurance papers and reflective safety vest, which you're legally obliged to carry, it's worth having some coins for parking meters. Also, if you're travelling with kids, keep some plastic bags to hand. Car sickness is a real possibility on winding country roads and things can prove messy unless you're prepared. Car hire Hiring a car in Italy is easy enough -- agencies are widespread and all the usual rules and regulations apply. But bear in mind that a car is generally more hassle than it's worth in cities, so only hire one for the time you'll be out on the open road. Also, think about what kind of car to get. Rural road surfaces are not always the best and many agriturismi and beaches lie at the end of long, axle-busting tracks. Similarly, road signs can be iffy in remote areas, so consider paying for sat nav. Top drives Here are a few roads to try out. • Bolzano to Cortina d'Ampezzo, Dolomites. • Montepulciano to Montalcino via Pienza, Tuscany • Sulmona to Pescasseroli via Scanno, Abruzzo • Chia to Porto Teulada, Costa del Sud, Sardinia • Vietri sul Mare to Sorrento, Amalfi Coast, Campania • Potenza to Metaponto, Basilicata Lonely Planet: How to survive a boring road trip © 2011 Lonely Planet.

A former hospital worker systematically shot and killed four people in upstate New York on Saturday, authorities in two counties said. Former hospital worker Frank Garcia, 34, has been accused in the shooting rampage. Frank Garcia, 34, was arrested Saturday afternoon. Garcia knew all four victims, police said, but they didn't reveal details about the relationships. "The individuals who were shot were known to the suspect. It was not necessarily a random act," Monroe County Sheriff Patrick O'Flynn said. The first two victims -- Mary Sillman, 23, and Randall Norman, 41 -- were fatally shot before 5 a.m. at Lakeside Memorial Hospital in Brockport, where Garcia was once employed, O'Flynn said. Another woman was wounded and is undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital, he said. The second shooting happened at a house in nearby Ontario County on Saturday afternoon. Christopher Glatz, 45, and his wife, Kim, 38, were killed "execution-style" while their two teenagers were in the suburban Rochester home, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said. The teens were not wounded, but it is unclear whether they witnessed the event. Povero said neighbors reported Garcia went door-to-door looking for the Glatzes' home. "He was in fact looking for the residence," Povero said. "He was saying different things to different people, but he was clearly looking for that home." Ballistic evidence has connected the two crime scenes, Povero said. Investigators found the matching brass cartridges from a pistol found on Garcia when he was arrested, he said. Garcia was arrested at a restaurant Saturday afternoon, CNN affiliate R-News in Rochester reported. Garcia was to be arraigned Saturday night in Monroe County, where the first shootings occurred, on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in the second degree, O'Flynn said. Sillman was a certified nursing assistant at Lakeside's long-term care center, hospital officials said. "During Mary's brief time within the system, those who worked closest with Mary described her as warm, kind and compassionate toward the residents of Lakeside Beikirch Care Center," Lakeside interim CEO Michael Stapleton said in a statement. Garcia likely will face similar charges in Ontario County, Povero said. "This certainly speaks to a tragedy that is enormous, not only the taking of the lives that were taken, but the people that were left behind, the person in Brockport and the two teenage children who were present when their mother was systematically murdered," Povero said.
You don't have to be a motorcycle enthusiast to be wowed by the custom bikes created by Paul Teutul Sr. and his sons as seen on the Discovery Network's "American Chopper" for a decade and now airing on CMT's "Orange County Choppers." Teutul, or "Senior" as he's called, left the U.S. Merchant Marine and eventually opened his first business, called "Paul's Welding," according to the Orange County Choppers website. After he grew his welding shop into a 30-employee business called "Iron Works," his passion for customizing motorcycles grew in leaps and bounds. But a constant companion on Senior's ride was alcohol. "Back in the day, I kinda started early drinking and getting high," he says. "If drinking was in the Olympics, I would have been a gold medalist." But he also says he thought he would grow out of what he now recognizes as addiction. That didn't happen. "What it does is it gets progressively worse, and I think that I finally got to the point where it kinda just took over my life completely," he says. Teutul says there's a long history of alcoholism in his family: "My uncle was an alcoholic, my mother was an alcoholic. And you know -- most of them died from that." Eventually, he realized everything he had built was at risk if things didn't change. "I was fortunate -- in 1985, I was running a business, I had a small wielding shop, and I just got lucky," he says. I went to a 12-step program and then I just kept going." Just because he stopped drinking, however, didn't mean his buddies did. "It's tough when you're not drinking and you've got two people on either side of you in a truck knocking down shots of Black Velvet (whiskey) and drinking beers and you're in the middle." It wasn't easy, he says. For nine years straight, he was afraid to miss a meeting. "It did take me two years before I wasn't thirsty anymore." He says he doesn't go to meetings these days and that he never feels like drinking. But Teutul says given his past experience, he will not drink again. Senior just celebrated 29 years of sobriety, which he describes as "quite the trip." "When you get sober, you put things in play and they happen," he says. "You think a lot clearer. Your whole attitude changes, you kinda learn how to live all over again, which is a tough thing by itself." And it's a message he continues to share. "My life's an open book, "says Teutul. "I know people that had problems and I think that I've been a power of example to them. I've heard from people that they've turned their lives around from me sharing my experience, so it's all good. I don't have a problem with sharing anything."
A strong earthquake measuring 6.1 in magnitude struck southern Iran on Wednesday, according to a report from the U.S. Geological Survey. The citadel at the city of Bam, Iran in 2005, hit by a quake in 2003 when 30,000 people died. The quake demolished nearly 200 villages in Iran's Hormozgan Province, according to Iran's Press TV, citing the head of the provincial disaster management headquarters, Yasser Hazbavi. At least six people were killed and 46 others were injured, Hazbavi told Press TV. People panicked and fled buildings when the temblor struck in the quake-prone region around 3:30 p.m. Iranian time (1100 GMT), Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported. It also knocked out power to the region.  See map of quake's epicenter » The epicenter was located 35 miles (55 km) west-southwest of Bandar e-Abbas, Iran --  just across the narrow Strait of Hormuz from the United Arab Emirates -- according to USGS. Mehdi Rezapoor, head of the Iranian Seismological Center, said it was "a medium-sized quake." Speaking on Press TV, Rezapoor had no details on damage, but said that based on the quake's strength, "I don't think it was very extensive." The quake shook nearby Dubai, where CNN staff members said they felt the building they were in shake for about 15 to 20 seconds. "From my office window at the Dubai Media City where all foreign media are located, I can see that a lot of offices have evacuated buildings," CNN Dubai Bureau Chief Samson Desta said. "I can see up to perhaps 200 people who have taken refuge out in the streets, causing somewhat of a traffic jam." There was no evidence of any damage in Dubai, where there are a lot of high-rise buildings. Iran lies on a series of seismic fault lines and has experienced devastating earthquakes -- most notably in December 2003 when a 6.6 magnitude quake devastated the ancient city of Bam in southeast Iran, killing at least 30,000 people.
In the 23 years since he tried to break up a robbery in central London, Ian Semmons hasn't spent a day without severe pain. The fight left Semmons with multiple fractures, including a broken back and two shattered ankles. He had a head injury so severe, doctors put him in a coma and kept him there for a month to control the swelling in his brain. "I spent nine months in hospital and then 12 months in a rehabilitation center, where I was basically rebuilt," Semmons says. "But nothing was done to treat my pain." His regular doctor, a general practitioner with Britain's National Health Service, offered little for the pain despite his complaints. At the time, patients in Britain's government-run system such as Semmons weren't able to switch to another doctor. Unlike patients now, he was stuck. Three years went by. Then Semmons moved a few miles away -- as it turned out, far enough for him to be assigned to a different doctor. During their first meeting, Semmons' new physician asked if he had been to a pain clinic for treatment. "I said 'What's that?' " Semmons recalls. "When he explained to me what it was, and said he was going to send me in to it, I discovered that it was in the very hospital where I had been treated. I had no idea it even existed." Semmons' experience highlights a reluctance of many UK doctors to treat pain aggressively, including a reluctance to prescribe painkillers, especially opiates -- the rampant use of which in the United States is widely described as an epidemic. Prescription drug deaths: Two stories Overdoses from prescription painkillers, usually involving alcohol, recently overtook car crashes as the No. 1 cause of accidental death in the United States. Despite making up less than 5% of the world's population, U.S. patients consume about 80% of all prescription pain medication. That's enough each year to give every man, woman and child a dose every four hours for three weeks straight. It's true that wealthier countries tend to use more pharmaceuticals overall. Despite a similar standard of living, on a per-person basis, patients in the UK receive less than half the pain medication as their U.S. counterparts, according to the Drug Control and Access to Medicines Consortium, a UK academic research group that studies issues related to medicine and drugs. And while the approach may anger patients like Semmons, British physicians say it's helped their country avoid the wave of misuse and overdoses that plagues the United States. The National Health Service runs roughly 300 pain clinics, and official guidelines from the British Pain Society, a group of professionals, state, "In most situations, for most patients and most pains, opioids should not be considered as first-choice treatment." Other treatments, including physiotherapy, acupuncture and massage are widely used. While U.S. doctors are also supposed to consider alternatives to medication, many are swayed by insistent patients, says Dr. Anthony Ordman, who runs the long-term pain clinic at London's Royal Free Hospital that he founded in 1997. By contrast, Ordman says, "The physician (in the UK) has a salary ... that takes away certain influences that the patient may have on the physician's thinking. I don't necessarily have to be liked by my patients." Ordman says the decision on whether to prescribe an opioid is complex, and only made after at least one long interview with the patient. "I tell (patients), 'You must please stick to the dose I prescribed for you and you must not escalate it without medical permission. You must keep the medication locked up and safe. You must please not lose your prescriptions, because I'm not going to replace them,' " Ordman says. "You begin to see we're almost building up a contract between physician and patient." But the process takes time. Patients need to be referred to pain clinics by their primary doctor. On average, it takes 18 weeks for a patient to be referred to Ordman's clinic, although he says in extreme cases he can sometimes find time to see a patient as soon as the next day. According to Semmons, many patients don't even know that they can ask for a referral. "There is a general lack of awareness of what there is out there to help (people) with their chronic pain. People don't know the right questions to ask." After finally getting his pain under control, in part with the use of painkillers, Semmons founded the advocacy group Action on Pain to try and help other patients. "What we tend to find is a lot of frustration," he says. Some people say their doctors think they're faking simply to receive powerful drugs. Others may feel intimidated. "There's the fear that if (people) go public with a criticism, (the doctors) will give you a tough time," Semmons says. Gupta: Let's end the prescription drug death epidemic Just as powerful opioids are tightly restricted in the United Kingdom, so are painkillers to which most Americans don't give a second thought. While you can walk into virtually any U.S. drugstore and pick up a bottle of ibuprofen or acetaminophen with 400 or 500 tablets, the largest size on UK shelves contains just 16 pills. If you consult a pharmacist and he or she approves, you can purchase 32 pills. "We have to protect the patient," says Howard Silver, a pharmacist at Gateway Chemist in London, who notes that even a moderate overdose of Tylenol can cause liver damage and even death. Shown a typical 400-count bottle of acetaminophen from a U.S. drugstore, Silver shook his head with dismay. "I'm astonished," he says. "That's a bottle of death." While that may sound alarmist, 12 million Americans in 2010 reported using opioid painkillers they might not need, or using them without a prescription. For all that, the stark differences between the two countries may be starting to blur. In some areas of the United States, doctors are shifting to a stricter approach. Last month, New York City announced that patients at public hospitals would no longer be able to receive more than a three-day supply of medicines such as Vicodin and Percocet. Lost or stolen prescriptions will not be refilled. Another example is Washington state, where an educational course for anyone who prescribes opioids is required by law, and a so-called "pain contract" to accompany any prescription. Meanwhile, the number of painkillers prescribed in the UK is on the rise. One factor may be recent changes to the National Health Service allowing people more flexibility in choosing a doctor. Semmons still walks with two crutches. Like the weather, his pain is always there, even as it changes from day to day. "It's a constant nagging pain and then it alternates up to a really sharp, needly pain, a stabbing pain," the 63-year-old says. On good days, he can stand to be philosophical. "I'm in pain every day. It's just a part of life." CNN's Stephanie Smith contributed to this report.
Charlie Sheen looks back on his rocky past while plotting the next phase of his career in the new issue of Rolling Stone, on newsstands Friday. The actor, who walked away from the massively popular CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" last year after a bizarre public meltdown -- complete with its own set of memorable catchphrases, from "Winning!" to "Tiger Blood" -- will soon star in the new FX show "Anger Management." On his post-"Two and a Half Men" antics: "Clearly, a guy gets fired, his relationships are in the toilet, he's off on some f****** tour, there's nothing 'winning' about any of that. I mean, how does a guy who's obviously quicksanded, how does he consider any of it a victory? I was in total denial." On being off the wagon and making no bones about it: "I mean, the s*** works. Sorry, but it works. Anyway, I don't see what's wrong with a few drinks. What's your drink? Tequila? Mine's vodka. Straight, because I've always said that ice is for injuries, ha ha." On his foot fetish: "I've not dated girls because of their feet, just the length of certain toes and the shape of where things should be and they're not. Hammertoes are bad. And the second toe being too long? That's bad, too." On his mended relationship with ex-wife Denise Richards: "He and I are like best friends now," says Richards. "Confidants. He tells me everything." Adds Sheen, "And we sleep in separate rooms. Everybody's going to want to know that, too." See the full story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.

Amanda Sedgmer, mother of five and daughter of coal country, believes that in this presidential election, her way of life is at stake. "If you ask anybody in the coal industry what would happen if Obama is re-elected, they'd say the coal industry is done," said Sedgmer, whose husband, Ryan, is a coal miner and whose family has depended on the industry for at least four generations. Sedgmer lives in Hopedale, Ohio, which sits on top of one of the state's richest coal deposits. For nearly a century here, mining has been one of the few professions guaranteeing a good and consistent salary. Read Sedgmer's original story on CNN iReport But in the past two years, an increasing number of coal-powered electricity plants across the country have announced closures. Estimates vary, but banking and industry analysis firm Credit Suisse put expected and known closures for 2009-2012 at 111 plants, that's one-fifth of the nation's nearly 500 coal plants. There are two main factors in the demise of those plants. First, the price of coal's competitor, natural gas, is decreasing. At the same time, a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency is pushing the price of coal up. That change, called the Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, rule requires that coal- and oil-fired power plants reduce pollutant emission rates significantly. The rule, which operates under the Clean Air Act, does not stipulate a lower level of carbon output. But by requiring lower mercury and other toxic emissions, it would reduce carbon as well. Coal mining families aren't the only ones facing shifts in industry The EPA estimates this will result in some 1% of national electricity capacity shutting down, and a cost increase of about 3.7% in retail electricity. But those in coal country give much higher estimates. They believe if President Obama stays in office and the rule continues, it will mean the end of their industry. "If coal fell, which is one of the main sources of employment around this area, everything would suffer," Sedgmer said while sitting on her front porch. "There'd be no funding for the schools, which are already suffering. I can't see how destroying one industry benefits anything." The job is a source of income for the family and pride for Ryan. "I like it," the 30-year-old said. "I enjoy doing it. ... It's provided for our family. We have a big family and we haven't had to worry about too much." Watch behind-the-scenes interview with Sedgmer The Sedgmers have invested a lot in their home in Hopedale, which is next to the towns where Ryan and Amanda grew up. When another mining job moved the family away, the Sedgmers rented out the 100-year-old home, keeping a foothold in their community. Thanks to a new mining job, two weeks ago the Sedgmers moved back to the area. They put up a "Home Sweet Home" sign in the kitchen. They want to stay. "If all coal mines shut down," Amanda Sedgmer paused, "we would struggle ... we would definitely lose our house. " Sedgmer voted for President Obama in 2008 and she is not a particular fan of Mitt Romney, but she's voting for the Republican because she believes he is the only chance the coal industry and her community have to survive. Romney hopes all this concern helps him in the Buckeye swing state and in other coal communities. He has told crowds at campaign speeches that President Obama "sure doesn't like coal." The president has vigorously disagreed, saying he is for "clean coal." Environmentalists believe the EPA rule and the increasing closures of coal plants are breakthroughs that are overdue and will do dramatic good. Les Brown, the president of the Earth Policy Institute, points to studies that coal emissions, including mercury and other pollutants, cause more than 10,000 deaths a year. "It's a war for survival," Brown said, sitting in a Washington office filled with piles of reports and papers about the environment. "Saving lives, not just a handful of lives, but thousands of lives. But more broadly, saving the planet." Would he like to see all coal plants closed? "Yes," Brown responded, "It would be cleaner, it would be safer and it would help stabilize the climate, which is the big threat to our future. I mean it's even difficult to put a price tag on that." Brown sees the problems with coal and climate change as a very human issue that could lead to droughts in some places, including the American Midwest, and floods in other places, like the American coasts. In either case, Brown fears loss of crops, homes and lives. But the same issue is personal to Amanda Sedgmer. Every day as Ryan prepares to go underground, he checks a bulletin board listing the latest coal closures. The Sedgmers' five children are still young, aged 16 months to 10 years. Those old enough to speak already talk about coal. When asked what he wants to do when he grows up, 4-year-old Ben Sedgmer blurts out, "Coal miner!" But his parents don't know if there will be many, or any, coal mining jobs waiting for him in Hopedale when he's old enough. For both sides, the war over coal is personal.

The day begins with a count of the necessities for a joint operation with Afghan troops -- among them 85 halal MREs (Meals Ready To Eat). Around the tactical headquarters, soldiers of the 172nd Infantry get a taste of home before setting off into the wilder fringes of lawless Ghazni province. There's baseball televised from Fenway Park, replete with a rendition of the "Star-Spangled Banner" by Rose Newton, aged 11. One lieutenant has his mortgage approved by email; another exclaims how he just can't wait to go home. This is FOB "4 Corners." And tonight these soldiers plan an air assault into an area called Qadem Khel, where the Taliban is basically the law. Neither this unit, nor other U.S. forces, will get to do many more of these as the drawdown of Allied forces gathers pace. Adding an air of anticipation to the mission, the men at 4 Corners believe two of the men they most want to take off the battlefield are in the area. They have a photo of one of them, with and without a heavy mop of hair. The helicopters arrive and, with the assistance of night vision for the Americans and some careful footwork by their Afghan colleagues, they climb aboard. The helicopters touch down in a huge expanse of desert. The troops huddle in the coldest moment before the dawn, and then begin their approach. The mantra now is "Afghan-led," part of NATO's bid to make this an Afghan-only war. The Afghan soldiers are mostly from the north or northeast of Afghanistan and to many locals they are strangers almost as foreign as the Americans. They lead the way, set the tempo. And, for a mission that many of the Americans thought might have been one for special forces, that tempo is pretty relaxed. In large numbers, in daylight, they amble into town. They're allowed into most homes; would you say "no" when four dozen armed men arrive at your door? When they meet a locked door, the Afghans seem to turn away, particularly when a pocket knife can't prise the lock. It is remarkable to watch, and their casual attitude is contagious to the Americans, who are soon also ambling, in between the occasional grimace at how this operation is being led. Soon it becomes clear that their prey has probably fled unless they're remarkably lazy. Sergeant Richard Snader admits that "once they hear the birds they probably leave immediately." But still they carry on, house to house, the first contact this village has had with the Afghan government in over six months. At times, it has an almost random feeling. Two boys are caught riding banned motorbikes. One Afghan soldier considers shooting the bike's fuel tank as a punishment, but decides that's probably too dangerous even for him. So the soldiers let the tires down, and then the more sheepish biker is given a couple of heavy slaps around the head. Instant justice, Afghan-army style. Far from western jurisprudence, but in rural Afghanistan, this is often what passes as the law. As they pass through the village, locals seem bemused, friendly. As though visited by aliens, rather than caught in a war. This is not a place where NATO has power, or Afghanistan's government even exists. Captain Chris Barlow says he's been told by locals that when the Taliban lay booby traps for NATO, they issue a warning to villagers over the mosque loudspeakers. This is their form of law. Barlow, with eight weeks left in his tour, accepts it's likely American forces won't return to Qadam Khel soon. Eventually, the insurgency makes an appearance. The Americans are searching a house where weapons had been found previously when shots are fired. There is confusion and the Afghan army seem to relish the fight ahead. U.S. airpower arrives quickly, with one of the heavily armed A10 warplanes buzzing the likely insurgent position. But after 20 minutes, it's clear children and women are near the insurgent firing position. The Americans dispense with any idea of an assault. They head back into the village, and at dark move again -- across wide open fields to the landing zone. A whirr of Chinook blades and a cloud of dust later, the Americans are gone, perhaps for the last time.
NFL player Samuel Hurd has been arrested and charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Thursday. Agents say Hurd, 26, a wide receiver for the Chicago Bears, was arrested Wednesday night after a five-month investigation that began in Dallas, where Hurd once played for the Cowboys. Authorities say he was trying to set up a drug distribution network in Chicago. The complaint states that Hurd met with an ICE undercover agent at a restaurant in Chicago on Wednesday night when, law enforcement officials say, Hurd introduced himself as the person communicating with a confidential informant. Hurd stated that he was interested in purchasing 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine, at $25,000 per kilogram, and 1,000 pounds of marijuana at $450 per pound per week for distribution in the Chicago area, according to ICE. Hurd said that "he and another co-conspirator currently distribute about four kilograms of cocaine per week in Chicago but that his supplier couldn't supply him with enough quantity," Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. After they finished negotiating, according to the complaint, the undercover agent presented Hurd with a kilogram of cocaine that Hurd accepted. "Hurd stated that he plays for the Chicago Bears and that he gets out of practice at about 5:30 p.m., after which he would make arrangements to pay for the kilogram of cocaine," ICE officials said in a news release, "Hurd left the restaurant with the bag of cocaine and was arrested shortly thereafter in the parking lot of the restaurant." If convicted, Hurd faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. CNN's efforts to contact Hurd's lawyers were unsuccessful Thursday afternoon.
Rick Weiland says when he was walking down the street making the music video for the song he wrote, a woman stopped him and thought he was country crooner Merle Haggard. You can't blame her for being confused. It's not every day a candidate for Senate plays the guitar and puts his campaign message to song, let alone make a music video. "I'm running for the Senate but I ain't a big wheel. I don't have an RV just my automobile. Hey, hey, no one's bought me," sings Weiland in the folksy, cheeky video. "It got 39,000 hits on You Tube," Weiland tells us proudly, saying his son produced it. The Democratic candidate says singing for the Senate is a good way to communicate, and helps show South Dakota voters who he really is. He now keeps his guitar in the car and pulls it out at rallies, like he did this week before an event with Sen. Tom Harkin of neighboring Iowa. Country-singing Senate hopeful 'rocks' South Dakota race But he also does it out of necessity. Until recently he has been left for political dead by his national party in his bid to keep this open seat in Democratic hands. South Dakota's Senate race was supposed to be a shoe-in for the Republicans -- one of three guaranteed pick ups in their quest to gain 6 six Senate seats to capture the majority. West Virginia and Montana, the other two, still seem like sure bets for the GOP, but South Dakota is suddenly iffy. There are many reasons that the contest has shifted into a four-way race that includes former Republican Sen. Larry Pressler, now running as an independent, and tea party candidate Gordon Howie. As a result, it has been hard for Republican candidate Mike Rounds, a former two-term governor, to consolidate his party in this right of center state. Rounds is also under fire for abuses in South Dakota, during his time as governor, of a federal program to swap green cards for business. He told CNN, as he has before, that he did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide, but he concedes the questions about it have taken a toll on his campaign. "It is one way to say 'big scandal,' suggesting a big scandal and that takes away from the issue of Obamacare and making it an issue, it takes away from the Keystone XL pipeline and getting it built and these are things that Democrats in South Dakota are absolutely on the wrong side of it," Rounds said. Several Republican strategists and high ranking officials in Washington tell CNN that Rounds' problems have been compounded by the fact that he was slow to fight back. He has always run campaigns without attack ads and didn't want to start now. When we put that criticism from fellow Republicans to Rounds, he chuckled. "We appreciate their input, we can learn as well, but there is also a way to win in South Dakota. We've won in the past, we think we're still on top of the way we think people in South Dakota want to see campaigns won," Rounds said. Pressler, an independent, thinks he knows how campaigns are won here too. He was a Republican senator for 18 years, and the At-Large Representative before that. 'Cowboy poetry' on the plains: An off beat senate candidate But he was defeated 18 years ago, and admits the world has changed a lot in that time. Pressler says the GOP in South Dakota got too conservative and the Senate he once served is paralyzed with partisanship. That's why he wants to run for just one more term, to help change it. "Well it's a very bitter place," he said in an interview. But the more flux this race is in, the more Pressler is attacked from all sides as a spoiler -- especially by the GOP. They're reminding voters Pressler supports the president's signature health care law and voted for the Democratic president twice. Pressler won't say which party he would caucus with if he wins the Senate seat. Some Democrats here are worried he will take votes from Weiland, especially because another concern is that he is too liberal for South Dakota. He scoffs at that, saying that's "national conventional wisdom -- the same national conventional wisdom that said this state was lost." CNN's Adam Levy contributed to this report
A court handed down a 20-year sentence Thursday for an Indonesian man convicted of helping assemble the bombs that killed more than 200 people in Bali in 2002. The Jakarta court found Umar Patek, 45, guilty of taking part in premeditated murder and conspiracy to smuggle explosives and firearms for use in terror attacks. Patek had faced a maximum penalty of death, and the courtroom was packed for the verdict delivered by a panel of five judges. He stared at the floor and showed no emotion as the verdict was read. He shook the judges' hands and hugged his lawyer before he was escorted to a car waiting in the basement of the courthouse for transportation to a jail on the outskirts of the city. Patek, who has expressed remorse for his actions, will consider appealing to a higher court, said his lawyer Asludin Hatjani. Hatjani said he was "very disappointed" by the verdict. "Umar Patek did what he was accused for because he was under pressure from his seniors, and he failed to convince them to prevent the attacks, although he already tried hard to do so," Hatjani said. Patek was one of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists, with a $1 million bounty on his head from the U.S. government's Rewards for Justice program. Three of the masterminds of the Bali bombings -- Imam Samudra, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron -- were executed in 2008. Patek was the last of the accused to stand trial in Indonesia. The October 12, 2002, blasts tore apart two nightclubs in Kuta, a town popular with tourists on the Indonesian island of Bali. At the time, the country's police chief called the attack "the worst act of terrorism in the country's history." Among the dead were 88 Australians and seven Americans. Patek eluded investigators looking into the 2002 attacks for many years until his capture in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the same village where U.S. Navy SEALs shot and killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden several months later. Patek was extradited to Indonesia in August. He faced six charges, including premeditated murder, for his part in the Bali bombings, as well as helping build bombs used in a series of attacks on Christmas Eve in 2000. He also was accused of smuggling firearms from the Philippines to Indonesia and planning a militant camp in Aceh in 2010. Patek denied all the charges but admitted helping mix a relatively small amount of the total quantity of explosives used in the Bali attack. The first bomb detonated in the busy Paddy's Bar on Jelan Legian just after 11 p.m., according to a report from the Australian Federal Police. Seconds later, as survivors fled the first blast, a second larger bomb hidden in a van exploded outside the crowded Sari Club. A third bomb went off later near the U.S. Consulate in Renon, a suburb of Denpasar, the Australian police said. Hundreds were reported missing in the confusion that followed the blasts. Many of those killed were foreign vacationers, although some residents were also caught in the attack. According to testimony given May 31 during his trial, Patek said that when he arrived in Bali, 950 kilograms of explosives had been combined, and he reluctantly agreed to mix the remainder. "When I saw Sawada, aka Sarjiyo, looking exhausted and nervous, finally I agreed to helped him and both of us mixed the explosive ingredients that were less then 50 kg. I did it lazily because it didn't come from my soul and it was contrary to my conscience," he said, according to an English translation of his testimony. Sarjiyo was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for his role in the attacks. During his trial, Patek asked for forgiveness for the bombings, which he said he "even suggested canceling." After the attacks, he said, he felt "remorse and regret." "I said that it was my last involvement on that kind of action in Indonesia. Please know that whether I came to Bali or not, the Bali bomb would still have happen(ed)," he said. Patek's lawyer argued that his client was not directly involved in the planning of the bombings. He doesn't deny helping assemble the bombs but was unaware how they would ultimately be used, his lawyer, Hatjani, said during Patek's trial, which started in February. Hatjani slammed the prosecution's case as "vague and far from the truth" and argued that an anti-terrorism law introduced in Indonesia in 2003 could not be used retroactively for the 2002 attacks. Prosecutors have used several articles under the penal code, the emergency rule law and the 2003 anti-terrorism law to charge Patek. Patek is one of the last figures associated with a splinter group of Jemaah Islamiyah, an al Qaeda-linked terror group behind the Bali bombings and other attacks in Indonesia. Many in that group, like Patek, trained and fought in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the early 1990s and were deeply influenced by bin Laden's teachings. Patek fled to Mindanao in the southern Philippines with several other Indonesian militants. One of them was Dulmatin, another former Jemaah Islamiyah member, who returned to Indonesia and helped set up a military-style training camp in province of Aceh. He was killed in a police raid just outside Jakarta in October 2010. Patek returned to Indonesia from the Philippines in 2009. Prosecutors allege that he was involved in preparing firearms for the Aceh training camp, a charge the defense disputes. "Patek was only in transit in Indonesia and was not involved in training of firearms," Hatjani said. "He was there to attend a wedding and he didn't even see the firearms." Indonesian authorities have tried and convicted hundreds of terrorists since the 2002 Bali bombings. The arrests of senior militants with combat experience have weakened the terror network and its ability to launch major attacks. Radical Indonesian cleric sentenced to 15 years in prison According to recent reports by the International Crisis Group, the terror threat in the country remains but has shifted to attacks on Indonesian authorities, with smaller groups or radicalized individuals targeting the police.

Like many mothers, Yan breastfeeds her child. But she's also found a way of making it pay. After noticing she produces more than she needs, Yan -- who lives with her five-month-old baby in Shenyang, the capital of China's northern Liaoning Province -- decided to sell it. "I don't want to waste my milk," she told CNN. "I heard that others sell breast milk online, and I thought 'Why not sell mine?' I created a Web page and started my business." A cursory search for "breast milk" on 58.com, a Chinese online shopping platform, reveals no shortage of mothers offering to sell their breast milk. From Shanghai to Guangzhou, nursing mothers are cashing in on this booming online trade. "I just need to wait for calls," said Yan. "I provide fresh and frozen breast milk. But you have to pick it up yourself." According to Yan, the market price is around 5,000 RMB (US$814) for a month's supply. In contrast, a month's worth of conventional baby formula costs around 2,000 RMB (US$325) in China. After China's tainted milk powder scandal in 2008, many new mothers who were unable to produce enough breast milk for their infant resorted to buying formula overseas â€” most notably in Hong Kong. However, earlier this year Hong Kong introduced limits on the amount of milk powder travelers can take out of the territory, over concerns about shortages and a "black market" in formula sold at vastly inflated prices. The restrictions have encouraged new mothers to find other means of sourcing milk to feed their babies. "If I don't have enough breast milk I would prefer to purchase human breast milk, because I don't trust our milk powder," explained Fang Lu, a newlywed who is planning to start a family. This week, the mistrust of milk powder extended to the biggest single supplier of dairy products to China. On Saturday, New Zealand company Fonterra announced that a strain of bacteria that causes botulism had been found in batches of an ingredient used to make baby formula, as well as sports drinks. China immediately halted imports of Fonterra-produced Whey Powder and Dairy Base powder, and increased inspections of New Zealand dairy products. Some mothers may be turning to others' breast milk as an "safer" alternative but health experts say it doesn't come without risks. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, babies fed unscreened milk from other mothers could be exposed to infectious diseases, including HIV, and illegal and prescription drugs. It adds that, if not stored properly human milk, "like any type of any type of milk, becomes contaminated and unsafe to drink." In May, China opened its first breast milk bank at the Guangzhou Maternity and Childcare Hospital and just last week another opened in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. However, like others around the world, they impose strict controls on who is able to donate, limiting the availability of supply. The trend of mothers' buying human milk online is not limited to China. A number of sites exist online to match buyers and sellers. Separately, an increasing number of women are turning to informal milk sharing sites that trust donors to properly store their milk and declare any lifestyle or health risks to prospective recipients. On those sites, the sale of breast milk is strictly prohibited. In China, trading human breast milk online occupies a legal gray area. While the Ministry of Health Law Supervisor Department has declared that human breast milk cannot be a commodity, no laws regulate or explicitly prohibit its sale. But while the practice may not be encountering legal obstacles, some people spoken to by CNN expressed discomfort with the growing popularity of the trade. Wangyan Liu, a doctor from Beijing, said he was concerned about breast milk sales, saying that poorly stored milk could make infants sick. "If conditions of breast milk storage are not good, then it's more dangerous," he said. "We need laws for the breast milk business." But for Yan, the emergence of China's breast milk market is a positive development -- and not one that is solely motivated by profit. "I think the business is totally fine. I have excess breast milk and I want to help others -- and earn some money," she said.
Western Sydney Wanderers became the first Australian club to win the Asian Champions League after a goalless draw away to Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal ensured a closely fought 1-0 aggregate victory in the tournament final Saturday. A heroic defensive display and some favorable refereeing ensured striker Tom Juric's goal in last week's first leg at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney was enough to claim the continent's most coveted club prize. Wanderers can now look forward to the FIFA World Club Championships in Morocco next month where they could come up against the likes of Real Madrid or San Lorenzo, current champions of Europe and South America's leading club competitions respectively. The unlikely triumph is all the more remarkable given that the Wanderers were only founded in 2012 and were playing in continental competition for the first time. Only 14 Wanderers fans were given visas to attend the game in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, which was played in front of a highly partisan crowd in the King Fahd Stadium. "The game was everything you expect from a final," explained a delighted Wanderers coach and former Mark Popovic in quotes carried by the Asian Football Confederation website after the match. "It is still a little surreal for me as a coach. I am sure it will hit home in the next few days when we reflect. "I am just proud for these players and our club. The first time in the competition, to win it, I think in the future we will really understand how special this run has been and how it was to win this title. Popovic's side have earned a reputation as a mean defensive unit over the course of the competition. Golakeeper Ante Covic was named the player of the tournament after the match and produced a series of spectacular saves in both legs of the final to keep the vastly more experienced Al Hilal at bay. But the keeper was extremely lucky not to give away a penalty midway through the second half when he cleaned out Al Hilal striker Salman al-Faraj in the box. Fortunately for Covic, the Japanese referee didn't point to the spot despite the protestations of incredulous Al Hilal players. Al Hilal's Romanian coach, Laurentiu Reghecampf, lamented the decision from the sidelines but later described being more disappointed by the fact his team were not able to make the most of their chances over both legs. "We had bad luck and we had many chances," Reghecampf said. "We were the best team over the two games." "If you lose one game when you play bad, you can congratulate the other team. But when you play how we played and they play how they played, we feel very bad." "We had a lot of chances but we missed them. If the ball does not come to our strikers they cannot score and that's why we have to find a balance between attack and defense."
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta departed Thursday for a trip to Asia aimed at updating friends and allies about Washington's new Pacific-oriented defense strategy. It is the secretary's second trip to the region since taking office. He is expected to return late next week. Before boarding the 12-hour flight across the Pacific, Panetta spoke to about 250 civilian and military personnel at Hawaii's Camp H.M. Smith, home of the U.S. Pacific Command. Panetta told those gathered that Hawaii is a "key point" in the U.S. military strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. The secretary also met with the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Sam Locklear, who plans to join Panetta for much of the trip. The first stop is Singapore, where Panetta is expected to deliver a major policy speech focusing on the role of the United States and its defense strategy in the Asia-Pacific region, according to a senior defense official who briefed reporters about the trip. "Basically the core of what we are trying to do with the swing through Asia is to give a comprehensive account to partners and everyone in the region about what the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific will mean in practice," the official said Wednesday. The scheduled speech is at the International Institute for Strategic Studies' annual Shangri-La Dialogue, which covers regional defense and security issues as well as global threats like terrorism and piracy. Panetta also is scheduled to meet with military leaders from Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Australia and perhaps China. "It's a good opportunity for the secretary to meet his counterparts, we'll have to see who the Chinese send," said a second senior defense official who also briefed the media. "If the opportunity is there and the schedules can support, we welcome that opportunity, as we have in the past." Much of the secretary's schedule at the Shangri-La Dialogue is still unclear because there will be so many officials from various Asian nations, and nailing down specific meetings is still being worked out. After Singapore, Panetta flies to Vietnam to meet with senior leaders there. "We're going to be able to thank the Vietnamese for their continual great assistance on remains recovery and other importation issues," the first official said, referring to Vietnam's cooperation in finding the remains of American servicemen missing since the war there nearly 50 years ago. The United States and Vietnam have been working for 17 years on normalization of their relations, and the official says those relations are "really healthy." From Vietnam, the secretary plans to go to India for his last stop. He plans to spend two days there meeting with top officials in New Dehli and "he'll be giving one major speech in India as well," the official said. "India is the only country we mention in the defense strategic guidance as a partner. And we are really shifting to a point at which our defense interactions with India are becoming routine." CNN Pentagon Producer Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.
Authorities found the mutilated remains of 14 people inside a truck parked in front of a city government office in northern Mexico Thursday, according to the Attorney General of the State of Tamaulipas . The bodies were found in the town of El Mante, Tamaulipas. 49 headless bodies -- just another crime in Mexico drug war? Investigators went to the scene near city hall and saw the bodies, which were 11 men and 3 women, authorities said. Federal forces have stepped up security in Tamaulipas and the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon since November 2010. The states are among Mexico's most violent, according to government statistics. Photos: Violence not going away Turf battles between the rival cartels have become common in northern Mexico. Last month, Mexico's interior minister said the Zetas drug cartel and members of the allied Gulf and Sinaloa cartels were in a fierce feud in the region. He blamed the battle between rival cartels for the 49 decapitated and dismembered bodies left along a highway in the northern city of Cadereyta, Nuevo Leon. More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence throughout the country since December 2006, when Calderon announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat cartels. In small-town USA, business as usual for Mexican cartels
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that "we will not surrender," even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his compound in Tripoli. "I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me," Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television. "But my soul is in God's hand. We will not think about death or life. We will think about the call of duty." At least three explosions rocked Tripoli late Tuesday night; it was not immediately clear what they hit. Earlier in the day, NATO targeted a military base and Gadhafi's compound, state television reported. A spokesman for the Libyan government said that at least 31 people were killed, including a number of civilians, and dozens more were wounded after 60 missiles struck the capital city. The compound was under "intensive continuous bombardment," according to state TV, which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed. "We will not surrender, we will not give up," Gadhafi said. "We have one option -- our country. We will remain in it 'til the end. Dead, alive, victorious, it doesn't matter." The blasts Tuesday, and others Monday that Libyan officials said hit state television buildings, elicited heated responses from the government spokesman. "We believe NATO understands that its military campaign is failing miserably," said spokesman Musa Ibrahim. "No one has the right to shape Libya's future except for Libyans." Ibrahim said Tuesday's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and revolution compound, which are military barracks near Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound. The spokesman said the attack on the television network killed two people and wounded 16. NATO disputed the account. "We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities. What we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli," the alliance said. "The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster's building is bogus." The back and forth between Libyan officials and NATO continues a public relations war between the two sides. Libyan officials have continually charged that NATO airstrikes have damaged civilian facilities and killed hundreds of civilians. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said recently that his forces have made "significant progress" in its U.N. Security Council mandate to protect Libyan civilians. This week, the Libyan government said it had evidence that alliance airstrikes were harming civilians. Officials took journalists to Tajura, a city east of Tripoli, to show them a small crater that held what appeared to be the remains of a rocket. The reporters were also taken to nearby homes that the government said had been damaged by airstrikes. NATO said it had been active in the area hitting military sites but could not say whether the attacks had caused the damage in the residential area. Reporters were also taken to a nearby hospital to see Nasib, a comatose baby who was a victim of the airstrikes, the government said. A woman, who the government said was Nasib's mother, cried over the child's listless body. Journalists were not allowed to talk to the woman or to the doctors. But one doctor quietly slipped a note to one of the journalists that said the girl was injured in a car accident, not a bomb attack. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking Tuesday to British lawmakers, said the European Union has added six additional ports controlled by pro-Gadhafi forces to its sanctions list in an effort to starve Gadhafi's troops of military supplies. He said the United Kingdom intends to push for additional sanctions against Gadhafi's regime. "Any political settlement in Libya requires an end to violence and Gadhafi's departure," Hague said. CNN's Raja Razek, Dan Rivers and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.
September 12 is always the day that reminds us that the war may never end. September 11, each year, is the day for somber commemoration and prayers for those who were lost.  September 11 is the date that lives in history. But as each September 12 dawns -- this year on Sunday -- we realize anew that the uncertain slog continues, that the year ahead will be one in which unseen and hazily defined enemies continue to wish ill on a United States that, in 2001, dedicated itself to a war on terror. Most wars eventually come to a close. This one, by its very nature, will not. One evening in the weeks after September 11, 2001, I was having dinner with John Glenn.  There is no American who has had the life that Glenn has: a World War II Marine fighter pilot who flew 59 combat missions, and who then returned to the skies in the Korean War to fly 90 more; the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth and the greatest national hero of his era; a United States senator for 24 years; at age 77 the oldest man ever to leave the Earth's bounds as he returned to space aboard the shuttle Discovery. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, with an injured and angry country hungry for retaliation and victory, Glenn, who had turned 80, was realizing something before most people did. "All the other wars we had," he said, "the object was to win the battlefield. Use tanks, use planes, take their capital, and declare victory. War's over. "But this. . .this is like the wind. This is like fighting the wind. . . .You can hit them, but they'll pop up somewhere else.  This doesn't seem to be the kind of war where you can look forward to them signing a surrender on the battleship Missouri." He was referring to the end of World War II. America's involvement in that war began on December 7, 1941, and ended less than four years later on the September day in 1945 when Japan signed its surrender aboard the Missouri in Tokyo Bay.  By the ninth anniversary of the beginning of World War II, the victory had long since been won; the surviving soldiers were home and raising families; the terrible times were all past tense. Nine years after the war on terror began, though, there is no end in sight, and even if there was, who exactly could sign a surrender?  In the first days of the war on terror, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, perhaps inadvertently, put his finger on it.  Speaking to reporters, he said: "I've therefore characterized this conflict, this campaign, this so-called war, as being notably different from others." This so-called war. Nine years ago the country went into what we were told was wartime footing. But unless you were a member of a family with a son or daughter, a father or mother, a brother or sister serving in the military, here at home it wasn't always easy to figure out precisely what that entailed. Nine years ago, the National Guard moved into U.S. airports when the terminals finally reopened to passengers; the Guard's saturation presence ended soon enough. Curbside baggage check-in was done away with because federal officials believed it provided an opportunity for terrorists; that decision, too, was soon reversed as the airlines complained that it was hurting their business.  The nation seemed uncertain of the appropriate rules in this new kind of war. It is largely forgotten now, but there were serious suggestions that salad bars be shut down because they were convenient targets for terrorists wanting to poison the citizenry. For a while a phrase from World War II -- "for the duration" -- re-entered the language, but that, too, soon disappeared when it became evident that the duration would most likely have no endpoint. Life went on even as the war went on. Last week, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey reported that 67 percent of Americans now believe that it is unlikely that the United States will ever capture or kill Osama bin Laden.  The subject of his capture, once a part of daily civilian conversations, seems to have been increasingly pushed aside. And so as another September 12 arrives we enter the tenth year of a war like no other.  Few among us would be optimistic enough -- or foolish enough -- to declare that placid times are just around the corner on this planet we all share. The anger in the world, especially during weeks like the one just past, does not feel as if it has cooled.  When the rhetorical heat becomes especially fervid,  I think of something else that John Glenn told me during that dinner. He was remembering the day in 1962 when he had looked out the window of a capsule hurtling through blackness and took in a sight that no American eyes had ever seen: the Earth, from the vantage point of space orbit. He recalled his thoughts with a combination of wonder and sadness. "You look down," Glenn said, "and you think about all the borders you fly over.  You fly by those borders so quickly, and you think of all the things that people do to each other because of those borders." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.
If North Korea is the crying capital of the world, Nigeria holds the aces when it comes to smiling and laughing. It's not simply anecdotal evidence. Nigeria has been adjudged a happiness-ridden country at least twice in recent years. In 2003, the UK's New Scientist magazine conducted a survey that found that Nigeria had the highest percentage of happy people in the world. Seven years later, another survey, a Gallup poll this time, found that Nigeria had the world's highest rates of optimism. Now don't ask me about the methodology of measuring Gross Domestic Happiness, or assembling an Optimism Index. What is not in doubt is this: the appearance of Nigeria -- an oil-rich, natural-disaster-starved, fertile-land-suffused country where 70% of the population survives on less than $2 per day -- at the top of these surveys, seven years apart, must mean something. Months ago, while at school in England, a Taiwanese friend observed the enduring optimism of the Nigerian soul, telling me Nigerians were fond of saying things would work out fine. The Taiwanese, she explained, were a lot less sanguine. Decades ago Afrobeat musician and 'prophet' Fela Anikulapo Kuti saw this. The saxophone-wielding sociologist-of-the-streets recorded "Suffering & Smiling'"as a testament to the never-say-die Nigerian spirit; to the remarkable capacity of the Nigerian soul to look beyond the prison wall and see, at midnight, a sun that not only hadn't risen but was not actually slated to rise. The song accuses organized religion (Christianity and Islam) of brainwashing Nigerians into a delusion-filled contentment with a dysfunctional status quo. "Suffer suffer for world, enjoy for heaven," Fela chants, in that timeless masterpiece. Is a 'Nigerian Spring' next? Commercial buses in Lagos are mobile placards, bearing text drawn from Holy Books, local sayings and conventional wisdom. "One with God is a majority." "The downfall of a man is not the end of his life." "It is well." The most popular, "No condition is permanent," says it all; succinctly capturing the psyche of a people who delight in trading grass-to-grace stories. Most fascinating are the ones that involve a sudden turn-around: the man who last week didn't know where the next meal was going to come from, but who today is feeding thousands at a party to celebrate his appointment as a Government minister. Pentecostal churches devote a chunk of their services of "testimonies" -- dramatic renderings of miraculous divine interventions. President Jonathan's most memorable campaign message involved juxtaposing his shoeless childhood with his adult influence. Yes, Obama did something similar (his father's humble beginnings in Kenya), but there was a difference: in Jonathan's version there was the subtext of a God-ordained destiny. It was no ordinary "only-in-Nigeria-is-this-possible-by-dint-of-aspiration" story. Nigerians, you see, are strong believers in the concept of a divinely-ordered "destiny" (not saying this is unique to us, though), strongly linked to the names we're given at birth. (We must be the only country in the world whose President is named "Goodluck.") It is because of this gift of nature that you will find Nigerians insisting -- erroneously, of course -- that suicide, like homosexuality, and revolutionary uprising, is an un-Nigerian act. This explains why you'll find Nigerians who insist that the Christmas Day bomber failed not because he was incompetent, but because he was Nigerian, and couldn't process the thought of a self-inflicted death. And this is why, when a lone suicide bomber attacked the Nigeria Police headquarters in Abuja last June, early reports said he was from a neighboring country. Nigeria's oil economics fuel deadly protests In light of the foregoing you can understand why, when the Arab spring commenced, a common topic of discussion amongst Nigerians was "Is this possible in Nigeria?" "Can Nigerians rise up in protest against their governments?" It was often asked in a rhetorical tone, questioner assuming the answer to be 'No'. Explanations would follow: Nigerians are too docile, too easily compromised, too steeped in hopes of an approaching -- and almost inevitable -- turn-around in their fortunes. There is apparently such a thing as an "adjustment bureau", founded, staffed and headquartered in Nigeria, which helps citizens, like the fabled frog, to consistently adjust to the rising temperature of boiling water. In our case until the time when, by divine intervention, the heat is turned off. It is therefore with surprise that I have observed, and participated in the series of public protest rallies now known as 'Occupy Nigeria' -- tens of thousands of Nigerians across the country and in the Diaspora, trooping to the streets to protest the insensitivity of a government that cut fuel subsidies benefiting a largely poor population whilst itself guilty of astonishing levels of profligacy. At one of the rallies, a man, told me that not even the protests that followed the annulment of the June 12, 1993 elections -- arguably the most significant act of subversion of the will of the Nigerian people in recent history -- drew such crowds. Had June 12 drawn those crowds, he said, things would have turned out differently. What is behind Nigeria fuel protest? So what has changed? What, in the collective Nigerian DNA, has undergone a mutation? Why are people trooping to the streets in an unprecedented manner, seeking to register their opposition. We'd have to turn to Tahrir Square in Cairo, and the Arab Spring, for some explanation. All of last year we were treated, via Al-Jazeera and CNN, to real-time scenes of dictators literally toppling from their thrones. Those images are powerful, and I think they filed themselves in our subconscious, awaiting such a moment as this. When the moment came, with the 110% rise in fuel prices on New Year's Day, I suspect that an exhuming started happening, of the buried images of people power from last year. Nigerians, with some tentativeness at first, and then with increasing boldness, seemed eager to not be left out of the wave of people power that has gripped their continent, everywhere from Tunis to Cairo to Kampala. Nigeria cuts fuel prices after national strike And then of course the internet provided a platform for the accumulation and direction of the anger and frustration. While it may be true that the internet is currently being used only by a minority of Nigerians, it appears that that minority is more significant than we all assumed, because all of those online people are connected to the larger society, and are thus able to channel the information and energy that effortlessly pools online. The numbers I saw last week at the Gani Fawehinmi Memorial Park in Lagos were astonishing, and hugely inspiring. And it grew by the day. By Thursday the spots where my friends and I stood comfortably on Tuesday had been taken over. And this was happening in cities all across the country. It is still too early to know the full extent of what this means for Nigeria's rather uncertain future. But one thing is not in doubt, Nigerians, experts at suffering and smiling, surprised themselves last week. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tolu Ogunlesi

Fans of porn star Stormy Daniels are drafting her to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana now held by Republican Sen. David Vitter. And it's no racy gimmick, they say. Porn star Stormy Daniels, who has no party affiliation, says she's "always up for a good fight." The Draft Stormy Web site says that "2010 presents the Pelican State with the opportunity to start with a clean slate -- to elect a representative that we can be proud of, who will work tirelessly, and who will challenge the status quo. We at the Draft Stormy campaign feel that Baton Rouge native Stormy Daniels is best suited to fulfill these duties." Vitter is famous -- or infamous -- for his link to the "D.C. Madam," the woman who ran a prostitution ring. Elected to the Senate in 2004, he admitted to "a very serious sin in my past" in July 2007 after his phone number turned up in records of an escort service run by the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the D.C. Madam. Running for re-election, Vitter said his wife has forgiven him and is banking on the same sentiment from his constituents. Will the Draft Stormy move mean stormy weather for Vitter? The senator's office didn't return calls by CNN. But a spokesman for the state GOP said voters "are concerned with real issues that affect their everyday lives and not with political or publicity stunts." The Draft Stormy campaign was started by New Orleans resident and Daniels fan Zack Hudson, who insists it's for real. Daniels, 29, isn't affiliated with a party but is embracing the idea of a possible candidacy.  Watch the adult entertainment star talk about a possible run » She said she's planning a "listening tour" around Louisiana to talk about a range of matters, including the economy -- which along with women in business and protection of children are the three issues listed on her Web site. When told Vitter can be a tough opponent, she said she's "always up for a good fight." "I think anyone that knows me ... is more than aware of that," Daniels said. "Politics can't be any dirtier of a job than the one I am already in." According to a capsule bio on the Draft Stormy Web site, Daniels has been "breaking barriers and shattering glass ceilings her entire life," serving as editor of her high school newspaper and president of her school's 4-H Club and eventually transferring "her determination and talents to the professional level, becoming a featured performer in the adult entertainment industry." Another stride was "signing an exclusive contract with the video production company Wicked Pictures, a company committed to a health and safety first policy, as pertaining to its video performances. Stormy's decision to sign with Wicked highlighted her commitment to sending a positive message to young people of the importance of practicing safe sex," the bio said. Daniels has directed films for the company, won awards for writing, directing and acting, and has appeared in mainstream films such as "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." "Originally, the focus wasn't even about making me as a candidate," Daniels said. "I think it was about bringing attention to the Senate race in general. Then the response was overwhelmingly positive. And I think everyone is just running with it." While her political aspirations may be a light diversion for Louisiana voters, reality will set in if Daniels tangles with Vitter. Clancy DuBos, political director of the New Orleans alternative newspaper Gambit, said Vitter is a brilliant politician with a campaign war chest worth $2 million. If the Daniels campaign is meant to remind voters of Vitter's D.C. Madam link, the move could backfire, DuBos said. "You are going to need someone better than a porn star, or a lap dancer, or a sex worker to nail David Vitter on this," he said. "You need a serious opponent who is himself, or herself, not guilty of something like that to say, 'Let's talk about family values, shall we?' " The Draft Stormy movement said Daniels' "real world experience and special understanding of the economic hardships facing Louisianans and Americans make her uniquely qualified to take on the tough challenges we face. "Our grass-roots movement spans the political spectrum and champions Stormy's philosophy of personal responsibility and the promotion of individual enterprise. We eschew partisanship and labels, instead judging our leaders on their integrity, character and effectiveness." CNN's Sean Callebs contributed to this report.
A German man is facing federal charges in the United States on suspicion of trying to extort money from supermodel Cindy Crawford and her husband, using a photograph of the couple's then-7-year-old daughter, court documents said. Edis Kayalar is charged with one count of extortion in a criminal complaint filed Thursday, according to Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. The photo, apparently taken as a prank by their former nanny, shows the couple's daughter bound to a chair, court documents said. Kayalar was deported to Germany from the United States in September after he had repeated contacts with Crawford and her husband, business mogul Rande Gerber. However, the complaint against him alleges, he continued to demand money from them. Federal prosecutors are in contact with German authorities on the matter, Mrozek told CNN, but as of Thursday night Kayalar was not in custody. If convicted, Kayalar faces a maximum penalty of two years in federal prison. Kayalar first contacted Crawford and Gerber in July, according to the criminal complaint. He told Crawford, who answered the phone, that he had a photograph of their daughter and wanted to help them out because he is a "good person," the documents said. Crawford then handed the telephone to her husband. Identifying himself as "Brian," Kayalar told Gerber he had a photograph of their daughter in "revealing clothing, bound to a chair and gagged," according to the complaint. He said he had stolen the photograph from the former nanny and that he wanted to return it because it "bothered" him and he felt it "just wasn't right," the complaint said. He told Gerber he wanted to give up the photograph so it would not end up in the tabloids, according to the documents. Kayalar told Gerber he had met the former nanny at a bar about three months before, when the woman still worked for the couple, and that he had been at her apartment and gotten Crawford's number from the nanny's cellular phone while the nanny was sleeping, the complaint said. The couple notified the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In the affidavit, an FBI agent states that she reviewed the photograph, which depicts the girl, who has since turned 8, bound and gagged in a chair and wearing shorts and a T-shirt. The girl told her parents -- who did not know it had been taken -- that the former nanny took it as part of a "cops and robbers" game. Kayalar called again, arranging to meet Gerber at a bar in Venice, California, to return the photograph, the court documents said. He did not ask directly for money, but hinted that he was "broke" and would like a monetary reward for the return, according to the complaint. Gerber brought a sheriff's deputy to the meeting. During the meeting, Kayalar told Gerber he did not have the original image with him, saying he had left it with friends for "security purposes," but showed him a copy he had saved on his cellular phone, according to the complaint. He told Gerber stole the photograph from the nanny's apartment along with a handwritten note saying, "The baby sitter went crazy and tied everyone up and they need your help! Please." Gerber and the deputy then got Kayalar to call and arrange to meet the former nanny with them. When the former nanny -- who was not identified in court documents -- saw Gerber with Kayalar, she "became extremely upset and began to cry," the court documents said. She apologized to Gerber and told him the photograph had been taken as a prank, and that she initially had planned to put the photograph and the note on the front door of the couple's home "in order to pull a prank on Crawford" but had not done so. On the way back to the bar, Kayalar repeatedly asked Gerber for money, the complaint said, saying that "he could get a lot of money from the tabloids for the photograph." He said he would deliver the photograph to Gerber the following day. Gerber went to meet with Kayalar the next day in Malibu, later telling police he obtained a hard copy of the photograph from him and gave him $1,000 "for his trouble," according to the court documents. But two days later, Gerber called police again, saying Kayalar called and demanded more money, saying he still had a copy of the photograph. During the Venice meeting, Kayalar told the sheriff's deputy he was a German citizen and that his true name was Edis Kayalar, the complaint said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement found he was in the United States illegally, and he was arrested and deported. In November, Kayalar began calling the couple from Germany, however, saying he had no choice but to demand more money since they had "gotten him deported," court documents said. He said he wanted $100,000 for not releasing or selling the photograph to the media. "Kayalar stated that before, he had not committed any crime, but that now he was committing extortion," the complaint said. He provided them with German bank account information. Gerber asked for proof that he still had the picture, and shortly afterward received an e-mail with a copy of it. Authorities traced the computer used to send the e-mail to Stuttgart, Germany, the complaint said. Since then, Kayalar has made another attempt to obtain money from the couple, according to court documents, and Gerber stalled, saying he needed more time to get the money.
Some of the most important turning points in the struggle for justice have occurred when individuals in our three branches of government courageously did the right thing by standing up against injustice. In the 1960s, Attorney General Robert Kennedy marshaled the power of the federal government to protect protesters at pivotal moments in the civil rights movement. Rep. Charles "Mac" Mathias, a Maryland Republican, bucked his party and reached across the aisle to help draft the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Alabama Federal District Court Judge Frank Johnson and the judges of the old Fifth Circuit helped to end legal segregation and enforce voting rights in the South despite much resistance. Last week, in the midst of our preparations for the 50th anniversary commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington, the civil rights community was heartened to see two modern-day versions of this kind of courage and commitment to justice. Attorney General Eric Holder and Federal District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin landed a one-two blow against mandatory minimums and "stop and frisk" racial profiling. Holder announced that the Justice Department would no longer seek severe mandatory sentences for low-level nonviolent drug offenders with no ties to gangs or large-scale drug organizations. Citing a report that black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20% longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes, Holder said, "This isn't just unacceptable -- it is shameful. It's unworthy of our great country, and our great legal tradition." It was inspiring, gratifying and satisfying to hear the nation's top law enforcement officer publicly recognize that mandatory minimum sentencing is wrong, overburdens our federal prison system and wreaks havoc on our communities. Why some movements work and others wilt In short, mandatory minimums have been a near disaster. On the same day that Holder made his announcement, another courageous public servant also did the right thing by striking down as unconstitutional New York City's notorious practice of "stop and frisk." Judge Shira Scheindlin found that between 2004 and 2012, the New York City Police Department made 4.4 million stops. Eighty-three percent of these stops were of blacks and Hispanics, even though they make up only 52% of the population. In 88% of these stops, the individual was found innocent of any wrongdoing and in 98.5% of the frisks, no weapon was found. Judge Scheindlin's decision followed the tradition of great judges who upheld civil rights. And, in conjunction with Holder's announcement, it offers the promise of a new approach to law enforcement in the United States -- smarter, saner more humane strategies that are tough on crime without targeting, tormenting and demeaning people and communities of color. We received a strong message from the executive and judicial branches. It is now time for the third branch of government -- Congress -- to adopt measures that address crime while protecting civil and human rights. Congress took an important step three years ago with the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between offenses for crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. However, that law applied only to future crimes, and does not affect anyone convicted prior to enactment, an unfortunate gap in an otherwise worthy measure. Rethinking drug sentences comes too late for some Congress should close this gap and take steps toward correcting and preventing the corrosive impact of mandatory minimums by passing the bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013. Among other things, this act would make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive to persons currently serving time for nonviolent drug crimes by allowing them to petition the courts for a review of their case. The bill would also reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, and give judges more discretion to determine sentences in nonviolent drug cases, enabling them to tailor the sentence to fit the particular crime and individual offender rather than forcing them to impose a "one size fits all" penalty. "Our current scheme of mandatory minimum sentences is irrational and wasteful," said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who has co-sponsored the act with Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois. The bipartisan support for the act offers hope for meaningful change and we strongly urge Congress to pass this measure as soon as possible. Opinion: Why did justice on incarceration take so long? Fifty years ago this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans of all ages, races, economic conditions and political persuasions lined up on the right side of history, marched on Washington and stepped into posterity. Today, every member of Congress has the opportunity to follow in their footsteps. If they look into their hearts and forward into history and honestly consider on which side of posterity they'd like to be at the 100th anniversary commemoration, they should know the right thing to do.

It's hard to think of a time in the history of America's intelligence community when it has been more battered by accusations of over-stepping or mismanaging its mission: to secretly gather information to support the activities of the U.S. government The list of recent revelations grew over the weekend with allegations that America has been systematically spying on its European allies. Reports in the European press, apparently drawn from documents provided by Edward Snowden, suggested that America spied on the European Union, France, Italy, Greece and other close international friends, listening in on encrypted fax transmissions and planting bugs and other devices at 38 embassies and missions in Washington and New York, as well as locations in Europe. The timing is not great: the eve of scheduled trade talks with the Europeans, a priority of the Obama administration. The new reports have caused a furor across the continent, stoking the uproar caused by earlier Snowden-related revelations that America has been listening in on millions of German calls and e-mails. Top officials, like Secretary of State John Kerry, shrugged it off by saying allies often spy on each other, and others, like former Director of the NSA and CIA Gen. Michael Hayden, noted that some friends spied on us. But the damage was done to important relationships and to the Obama administration's prior claims that it would conduct itself according to a different standard than past U.S. governments. All nations collect intelligence, Obama says This all comes on the heels of reports that the overreach of the intelligence community begins at home. While it will be cold comfort to our NATO allies that we are only treating them as we do our own people, the details of programs that warehouse massive amounts of phone metadata and e-mail traffic were the first shock waves produced by the Snowden leaks. But the problems go beyond what Snowden leaked to the very fact that a comparatively junior contractor could gain top level clearances and access to so much information. Indeed, it is deeply disturbing that hundreds of thousands of private contractors had Top Secret clearances and that, as we have learned, many may have gone through inadequate screening procedures or been inadequately managed. Earlier news -- about the scope of U.S. drone programs managed by the intelligence community, "kill lists," extra-judicial targeting of perceived threats, the scope of America's cyberwarfare programs against enemies in Iran (Stuxnet), China and elsewhere -- have already called the role of the community into question. Just last week NBC News reported that a senior U.S. military leader very close to President Obama and his national security team, Gen. James Cartwright, was a target of a leak investigation concerning Stuxnet.. These are all stories of a culture of secrecy and of arrogance that has simply gone too far. Perhaps each and every one of these missions began with a reasonable national security goal. But because so much of the planning and execution takes place behind closed doors or in situations in which the term "oversight" is laughably applied to wink-and-a-nod rubber stamping of initiatives, it is perhaps more surprising we have seen so few scandals than that we are dealing now with what seems like so many. Consider: According to the U.S. government's own figures, last year the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court received 1,789 applications for approval of government spying operations and OK'd all but one. Since 2001, according to a report in Salon based on government figures collected by the Federation of American Scientists, more than 15,000 applications were approved and only 10 denied. The Supreme Soviet of Cold War Russia was a less effective rubber stamp. The FISA Court is just one of the feeble oversight mechanisms that apparently did not do its job. Congressional and executive branch officials have bought into the post 9/11 paranoia and hopped up threat mentality and come to accept that even the possibility of an attack on the United States warrants disregard for U.S. laws and international agreements. Not to mention the principles of respect for individual liberties and reasonable constraints on government power on which the United States was established. This was well illustrated when NSA Director Keith Alexander argued that the agency's massive surveillance programs were warranted because they allegedly stopped "over 50" terror attacks, with scant reference to the size of the attacks, the real risk posed, whether other means to stop them that didn't involve massive surveillance might exist, or to the possibility that the damage done to civil liberties might be worse than that which might have been produced had the terror plans gone forward. Opinion: Why we're all stuck in the digital transit zone with Snowden Indeed, senior U.S. officials have told me that, in their view, a primary motivator for accepting all these programs was fear that resisting would hold dire political consequences for them, should an attack occur. In other words, in the modern U.S. intelligence community, CYA has become more important than CIA. There are real threats out there. And, yes, other nations spy on us. Terrorists use new technologies to target American interests and citizens and must be contained. Cyberwarfare poses a growing threat to the United States as well as other nations. All these facts require analysis and countermeasures by the U.S. government. Some require the United States to go on offense. But what the revelations show is a series of errors of overreach and bad judgment, not that all our programs should be eliminated. The problem here is one of scale and of profoundly compromised and twisted values. That problem itself is complicated and exacerbated by America's emergence as the world's first cybersuperpower. As such, we have sought to flex our technological muscles not only in ways that make us safer but that introduce a new form of constant, low-grade, invisible conflict that makes Cold War spy games seem quaint in their narrowness--even if their stakes were much higher. In the past, I've called this Cool Warâ€”neither cold nor hot but dangerous nonetheless, not just to our enemies but also to our friends, our interests and our values. Edward Snowden broke the law and if the United States can bring him in, he deserves to be prosecuted. But the ones who should be in their own hot seat are those who created, approved and rationalized into existence the sprawling, seemingly uncontainable global intelligence and cyberwarfare apparatus that is as much of a threat to the kind of country we want to be as any terrorist group. Opinion: Why can the U.S. do about Snowden? The problem for us, of course, is the only people with the power to restore balance and common sense limitations to these programs are the ones who let them get so out of control in the first place.

This week Marketplace Middle East focuses on the relationship between Israel and the "new" Egypt. IN FOCUS: Egypt's Ramadan professions Egypt is still forging its new foreign policy. Domestically, however, boosting economic growth is a top priority. The country has been struggling to get back on its feet since its revolution last year. But for some Egyptians, business is picking up. And it has a lot to do with Islam's holiest month FACETIME: Erel Margalit, Jerusalem Venture Partners Technology is one of Israel's key industries. In fact, high tech products account for around 45% of its exports. But while many consider Tel Aviv Israel's Silicon Valley, Erel Margalit is looking to the ancient city of Jerusalem as a gateway to the country's business future.
The chief financial officer of India's Satyam Computer Services Ltd. was arrested Saturday, the third person taken into custody in a scandal that began when the company's chairman admitted inflating profits with "fictitious" assets and non-existent cash. Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju is shown Saturday being sent to prison in Hyderabad. Vadlamani Srinivas will appear Sunday before a special court, said A. Sivanarayana, additional director general of police in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, told CNN. Company founder B. Ramalinga Raju and his brother, Rama Raju, Satyam's managing director, were arrested Friday in connection with the scandal. In a letter written to investigators, B. Ramalinga Raju admitted that he and his brother were responsible for cooking the books at Satyam, according to CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN. Satyam, India's fourth-largest software-services provider, serves almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generates more than half its revenues from the United States. It employs some 53,000 people and operates in 65 countries. B. Ramalinga Raju resigned Wednesday and confessed to padding company balance sheets. The practice began several years ago to close "a marginal gap" between actual operating profit and one reflected in the company's accounting books, he said, but continued for several years. "It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten," B. Ramalinga Raju said in a letter to the company's board of directors. He said no board member was aware of what he was doing and he did not profit from the inflated accounts. The deception came to light after he tried to plug the hole by getting Satyam to buy his son's construction companies. The acquisition was "the last attempt to fill the fictitious assets with real ones," he wrote in his letter. The deal would have cost Satyam $1.6 billion -- but the company's board vetoed it. Stocks fell following the botched deal. Soon afterward, B. Ramalinga Raju came clean, saying he was doing so "with deep regret, and tremendous burden that I am carrying on my conscience." After his confession, stocks of the Hyderabad-based company fell more than 70 percent, causing India's major stock index, the BSE SENSEX, to fall 7.3 percent Wednesday. The BSE SENSEX on Thursday deleted Satyam Computer Services from its indices. The company's interim chief executive officer said Thursday the company's immediate goal is to continue its operations uninterrupted. CNN's Bharati Naik and Harmeet Singh contributed to this report.
Carol Ann Carnese never considered herself an anxious person. Except when it came to wet wood. Does this small creature terrify you? You might have sciurophobia - the fear of squirrels. "If I saw someone lick a wooden spoon, I had to turn away," says the 41-year-old massage therapist from Portland, Oregon. "I'd break out into a sweat ... and I'd just get sick to my stomach. I could not even look at someone with a toothpick in their mouth." It wasn't just looking at wet wood that freaked her out. It was touching it, too. "I could not eat Popsicles to the end," Carnese explains. "As soon as I got close to the end, I would give it to my kids. I would not even own wooden utensils because I could not wash them. Not even in the dishwasher because they would still be damp when they came out." Until Carnese was treated by a professional -- a process that involved gradual exposure to wet wood to "reprogram" the way she thought about it -- physical contact with wet trees, fences and the deck surrounding her hot tub was out of the question. (Instead, she would wear slippers to walk back to the house post-soak.)  See some examples of unusual phobias » A common affliction Carnese's fear of seemingly innocuous objects and situations is no anomaly. Phobias are the No. 1 psychiatric illness in women of any age and the No. 2 in men older than 25, according to the American Psychiatric Association. A "specific" phobia, or an "excessive and unreasonable fear of a specific object, place or situation," afflicts about 19 million people in the U.S., according to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America. Fears can range from the relatively commonplace fear of closed spaces, or claustrophobia, to the more unusual, such as a fear of dolls or children, known as pediophobia. "Phobias can affect anyone," says Elizabeth Lombardo, a clinical psychologist in Wexford, Pennsylvania. "So many highly functioning people have them. It doesn't matter your socioeconomic status, your intelligence level." Being rational doesn't help Even realizing that a doll or a wet popsicle stick is harmless doesn't help sufferers overcome their phobias. "Knowing that it isn't rational or it doesn't make sense doesn't help them get over their fear," Lombardo explains. "Your mind says it's not rational, but your body says, 'Yeah, but I'm scared.'" Just ask Bryan Schultz, 36, who is afraid of "any small, furry animal that gnaws on things." "Rabbits and squirrels are especially terrifying for me, but even non-rodentia, like ferrets, freak me out," says the copywriter from State Center, Iowa. "I work right next to a park with many trees, and I have to honk the car horn to scare any critters away before I open the door on many mornings." "I recognize rationally that it's funny," says Schultz, who doesn't consider himself a "fearful" person. But that doesn't stop his heart from doing backflips when he encounters a squirrel. Coping mechanisms Rather than seek professional help, which often involves confronting the feared object or situation directly, phobics may try to manage their anxiety through avoidance. "I've never sought treatment, partly out of embarrassment and partly because I've learned to cope by making small modifications," Schultz says. Instead of walking on the sidewalk, he quickly moves to the street if he spots a squirrel in his path. When a carpool buddy intentionally parked under a tree filled with squirrels as a prank, "I had to honk the horn and sit in the car for seven minutes" after his colleague had gone into the office, Schultz says. Peyton Pinkerton, 37, guitarist with the band Pernice Brothers, battles a similar impulse to flee the object of his personal phobia: clowns. "I was yelled at by a birthday party clown when I was about 4 years old and have been absolutely terrified of them ever since," says the resident of Northampton, Massachusetts. "If I'm surprised by seeing a clown, it's like snakes or rats. My fight-or-flight response kicks in," Pinkerton says. "I have run out of malls, fairgrounds, etcetera, on repeated occasions." Face, don't flee, the fear Avoidance and other quick fixes are no substitute for treating the phobia, Lombardo says. "That's what we call a Band-Aid reaction," she says. "It perpetuates your fear." The good news, Lombardo says, is that phobias can be cured. If you're suffering from one, she suggests the following: • Go easy on yourself. "People are so embarrassed by this," Lombardo says. "They think there's something wrong with them." But, she says, not beating yourself up is key. • Remember to breathe. "When people are confronted with their fear, their distress level increases," Lombardo says. "Deep breathing is always a good thing." • Seek counseling. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which Lombardo practices, can often help patients kick their phobias in eight to 12 sessions. CBT focuses on changing self-destructive ways of thinking. • Face the music. Facing the feared object head-on is important. "You're retraining your body in addition to your mind. It's like putting your feet in a hot bathtub or cold pool: You wait a little bit, and your body gets used to it," Lombardo says. LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

Lori Berenson, a U.S. citizen jailed in Peru since 1995 for helping leftist rebels, has been granted conditional release, a judge announced. Berenson has served nearly 15 years of a 20-year sentence for aiding Peruvian rebels in a 1995 plot to overthrow Peru's Congress. Judge Jessica Leon Yarango made the announcement Tuesday in a televised court hearing after Berenson's lawyer, Anibal Apari Sanchez, made the request. Apari, a Lima lawyer and candidate for mayor of a Lima suburb called Villa El Salvador, is also Berenson's husband from whom she is separated, according to her parents. Berenson, 40, who last year gave birth in prison to their son, Salvador, has long maintained her innocence. Her original sentence of life in prison was reduced to 20 years on appeal. The news of her release was welcomed by her parents in New York. "My wife Rhoda and I were ecstatic," Mark Berenson told CNNI. "We were waiting for this day for 14-1/2 years." "We are thrilled that it's been determined that she's earned her conditional liberty and that she and her baby, Salvador, will be able to take their first steps in freedom soon." He said his daughter applied for the conditional liberty, which he referred to as parole, in September. "The process took many months because they had to check on her work records and conduct records in all the prisons that she's been in since 1995." He said she had been working seven days a week co-managing a prison bakery for more than five years in order to shave time from her sentence. On the Web site freelori.org, the Berensons said their daughter and her son will be leaving prison "in a few days" and plan to move to an apartment in Lima, because parole requires they remain in the city in which they were incarcerated. "We do not know if there are exceptions for foreigners or whether Lori will be permitted to travel to the U.S. while on parole," they wrote. "Lori will be a single mom -- Anibal and Lori are legally separated but remain friends and both share concerns for Salvador's proper upbringing," they wrote. "Salvador, now an active 1-year-old boy, will certainly enjoy the opportunity to run around outside the confines of the prison. He is learning both English and Spanish but babbles continuously in 'unknown tongue.' He is a very happy child and loves to be with people." Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this story.
Football history was made at the opening match of FIFA's Club World Cup in Japan on Thursday when goal-line technology (GLT) was made available to a referee for the first time. Host side Sanfrecce Hiroshima beat New Zealand's Auckland City 1-0 to earn a quarterfinal clash with African champions Al Ahly of Egypt, but the result will remain a footnote to FIFA's "revolution". Despite resisting calls for the introduction of GLT for many years, FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke stated that there was "no reason to be against this technology" on the eve of the match. The first referee to have access to the system in a competitive game was Djamel Haimoudi but the Algerian had no need to call upon GoalRef's magnetic field system in Yokohama. This is the first of two goal-line systems being trialed at the competition for the continental club champions, in which the title-holders of the host nation (J-League winners Sanfrecce Hiroshima on this occasion) also participate. Hiroshima, who won the Japanese championship for the first time last month to earn their place in football history, will also take part as the second system is used, with camera-based Hawk-Eye being used for Sunday's tie with the seven-time African champions. "This is a kind of revolution," Valcke told FIFA's website before the match. "It is the first time that this kind of technology is coming into football. We must ensure that when the ball goes into the goal, the referee must get the information that the ball has gone in. "The referee has the final decision. The technology won't change the speed, value or spirit of the game." It changed little as Hiroshima saw off Auckland City, thanks to a stunning strike from Toshihiro Aoyama after 66 minutes, as the New Zealanders' impressive goalkeeper Tamati Williams was finally beaten. However, it has added a further element to the referee's pre-match ritual with officials now needing to test the system 90 minutes before every match to determine whether the technology is working as expected. After FIFA had seemingly abandoned GLT in 2008 after freezing experiments into the practice, and preferring instead to look at using additional referees, the issue was reborn at the 2010 World Cup. After a Frank Lampard shot crossed the line but was not given as England lost to Germany in the Round of 16, FIFA chief Sepp Blatter backtracked on his previous belief that there was no room for goal-line technology in football. After a long testing process, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) voted in July to use GLT at the ongoing Club World Cup, as well as the 2013 Confederations Cup and 2014 World Cup in Brazil. "This is also an important day for us," Valcke had said on Wednesday. "Because we will use one of the two systems we are using here in the Fifa Confederations Cup next year." Both Britain-based Hawk-Eye and Germany's GoalRef transmit their findings to devices that can be worn on officials' wrists.
Iraq and Turkey have agreed to allow flights between their countries, ending a mutual ban that began with a dispute about how an Iraqi government oil company owed millions of dollars to Turkey, Iraqi officials said Thursday. Turkish planes resumed flights to Iraq on Thursday and were landing at the Baghdad airport, Iraq's Ministry of Transportation said. Iraqi airliners will begin landing in Istanbul on Friday, officials said. On Monday, Iraq banned all Turkish flights from landing in the country, including the semiautonomous Kurdish region, as a response to a similar ban last week in Turkey against Iraqi flights. However, a Turkish government official denied that Ankara blocked Iraqi planes. The official did say that Turkey warned that if Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization did not pay the $3 million owed to his country, the country would ban Iraqi aircraft. Both countries agreed to drop the bans after negotiations. After years of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Turkey's flagship carrier Turkish Airlines was one of the first international companies to begin direct flights to Baghdad. Increasingly, Turkey has grown as a major international gateway for commerce and travel to and from its Iraqi neighbor.
with spreadsheets on missions, assassinations and captured assets. And reports from Iraq's government suggest ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it's not clear whether he was wounded, whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck. But if al-Baghdadi is dead, what would happen to the radical Sunni militant group? Don't expect ISIS to just crumble. "It will morph, and new leaders will emerge," retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks said. "In fact, bear in mind that ISIS leadership originated from Saddam's military. These are very conventionally trained, very professional leaders." Odds are al-Baghdadi or the Shura Council, which handles the group's religious and military affairs, has planned this scenario in advance. "ISIS likely has a clear line of succession," said Lauren Squires of the Institute for the Study of War. "This is a bureaucratic organization with a deep bench ... either Baghdadi has signed off on the line of succession himself or the Shura Council has agreed to a line of succession." Top two deputies Al-Baghdadi has a Cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, who oversees ISIS' mission in Iraq, and Abu Ali al-Anbari, who is in charge of operations in Syria, according to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. Both men are veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein. "These people who had previously served in Saddam Hussein's army were extremely brutal because Saddam Hussein's regime was very brutal," said Peter Neumann of King's College. "But they also inherited the disciplines and the military skills that are now benefiting ISIS in its campaign against its enemies." Analysts say al-Turkmani could make a strong case to become the leader of ISIS if al-Baghdadi is taken out. "He would also have had to have a lot of outstanding qualities either in the political or the military field, and that certainly makes him a potential contender," Neumann said. Beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both Iraq and Syria. Those governors handle financial, military, legal, media and intelligence councils, among others. What's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of ISIS is that it looks a lot like those of some Western countries whose values it rejects -- except there's no democracy involved and there's a council tasked with considering who to behead. Another possibility Then there's Syrian Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the chief spokesman for ISIS who could also take over the group. In September, al-Adnani called for ISIS supporters to launch lone-wolf attacks. Analysts say some of al-Baghdadi's top deputies were imprisoned with the spokesman at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq where al-Baghdadi was also held for at least four years. "He was able to trust these individuals as sharing his ideology, sharing his hatred for the West.," Squires said. The Shura Council's importance If al-Baghdadi is still alive, there's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence. The Shura Council is the religious monitor for ISIS. Not only does it make sure all the local councils and governors are sticking to ISIS' version of Islamic law, it has the ability to stand up to al-Baghdadi. "The Shura Council has the right to tell Baghdadi to go if he's not adhering to ISIS' religious standards," said Jasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. "It would most probably never happen, but the fact that it's possible indicates the council's prominence." She said the recent beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council's purview. On top of that, Opperman said, the Shura Council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of Sharia law. But what happens if al-Baghdadi dies might just be hypothetical for now. While some Iraqi officials say the ISIS leader was wounded in an airstrike, U.S. officials say they can't confirm whether al-Baghdadi was hit at all. CNN's Dugald McConnell, Nick Thompson, Atika Shubert and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.
Before a cheering crowd at a town hall meeting in New Orleans, President Obama fired back at critics who accuse him of accomplishing little in his nine months in office, saying "I'm just getting started." President Obama speaks at a town hall meeting at the University of New Orleans on Thursday. "I never thought any of this was going to be easy," said Obama, speaking at the University of New Orleans in his first visit to the Gulf Coast city since taking office. He poked fun at his critics, asking, "Why haven't you solved world hunger yet? It's been nine months. Why?" "What'd I say during the campaign? I said change is hard," Obama said. "Big change is harder. ... I wasn't kidding about it being hard." "Those folks who are trying to stand in the way of progress ... let me tell you, I'm just getting started," he said. "I don't quit. I'm not tired. I'm just getting started." Before taking questions, Obama discussed the recovery effort in New Orleans, a city struggling to get back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina. "It has now been just over four years since that terrible storm struck your shores," the president said. "And [in] the days after it did, this nation and all the world bore witness to the fact that the damage from Katrina was not caused just by a disaster of nature, but also by a breakdown of government, that government wasn't adequately prepared and we didn't appropriately respond." Obama said that when he took office, he pledged to make Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts and disaster response top priorities of his administration. "So far, I'm pleased to report that we've made good progress," he said. "We've got a long way to go, but we've made progress." He said he has sent more Cabinet members to the Gulf Coast than any other region -- "not just to appearances, but to listen and to learn and help you move forward." Also, he said, his administration has helped eliminate red tape and turf disputes in order to get stalled programs moving, and freed up $1.5 billion in recovery funds. He said his administration is tackling "corruption and inefficiency" that has plagued the New Orleans Housing Authority for years -- remarks that drew applause from the crowd -- and has helped move families out of emergency housing, helping homeowners rebuild and helping renters find affordable options. The government has also invested in supporting health centers and recruiting primary care providers, nurses and other professionals to fill shortages left by the 2005 hurricane, he said.  Watch bloggers debate Obama's handling of New Orleans » Before the meeting, Obama toured the Martin Luther King charter school -- the first charter school to reopen in New Orleans' Ninth Ward, the hardest-hit portion of the city. The president called the school "an inspiration for this city." However, "it's clear how far we have to go before we can call this recovery a real success," he said, adding that much remains to be done to repair roads, hospitals and schools and rebuild neighborhoods. "We will not forget about New Orleans," he said. "We're going to keep on working." He also touched on the economy and on health care reform. "Too many Americans have waited too long for this to happen," he said, drawing wild cheers from the crowd. "We are going to pass health care reform by the end of the year." Meeting the challenges faced by the nation, he said, "requires diligence and perseverance and patience ... it requires a renewed spirit of cooperation among our citizens." He took questions from the crowd on topics ranging from the school dropout rate to immigration. One man asked Obama, "Why is it four years after Katrina we're still fighting with the federal government for money to repair our devastated city? ... I expected as much from the Bush administration, but why are we still being nickeled and dimed in our recovery?" The president responded, "I make no excuses for the fact that the federal government did not work effectively with state and local governments immediately in the aftermath of the storm to make sure that everybody got the help they needed right away. And we are still working through the backlog of problems that existed." "My expectation is that by the time that my term is over, you guys are going to look back and you're going to say, 'This was a responsive administration on health care, on housing, on education, that actually made sure the money flowed and that things got done the way they were supposed to get done," he said. A fourth-grade boy asked Obama his final question: "Why do people hate you? They're supposed to love you. And God is love." "Well, now, first of all, I did get elected president, so not everybody hates me now," Obama said. "... If you were watching TV lately, it seems like everybody's just getting mad all the time. ... Some of it is just what's called politics, where, you know, once one party wins, then the other party kind of feels like it needs to poke you a little bit to keep you on your toes." In addition, he told the boy, some people have lost their jobs and are frustrated. "When you're president of the United States, you've got to deal with all of that," he said. "... I'm a pretty tough guy. Are you a tough guy?" Four years after Katrina, evidence of the storm's devastation lingers. About 1,500 people in Louisiana are still living in temporary housing, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, although that is down from a high of more than 90,000. And the Army Corps of Engineers is only a third of the way through a $15 billion system to provide 100-year flood protection for the city. However, the agency says 76 disputed projects in Louisiana have been resolved since Obama took office, and more than $1.4 billion in aid has been sent to Louisiana, along with more than $160 million to Mississippi. And it says that more than 89,000 Louisiana households and 45,044 Mississippi households displaced by Katrina -- and by Hurricane Rita, which hit a month later -- have found longer-term housing solutions. The emergency agency also says more than $1 billion from the stimulus program has been targeted for New Orleans. The Obama administration's efforts have been praised. In August, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, told the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper, "there is a sense of momentum and a desire to get things done." Still, the length and nature of Obama's visit Thursday drew some ire. The president was to spend less than four hours in New Orleans and will not visit other areas of the Gulf Coast affected by Katrina, such as the Mississippi coast. "The people of New Orleans deserve more than a 'drive-through daiquiri' summit with the president," Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, said in a news conference Monday. And Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote in a letter to Obama that "if the town hall is the only major event of the visit, I truly think it will be deeply disappointing to most citizens." The White House said that Obama has been to New Orleans five times since Katrina, and that since Obama took office, there have been 35 trips to the Gulf Coast by more than 20 senior administration officials. "The president made a promise to come to New Orleans and wanted to fulfill that promise as soon as his schedule allowed," White House spokesman Nicholas Shapiro said.
Hong Kong (CNN)In a modern twist of public square shaming, a Chinese court has blazoned the names and offenses of 50 individuals and four companies that have dodged paying fines. Their photos and personal details have been splashed across a giant electronic screen outside a major train station in Changsha city in China's southern province, Hunan. Curious onlookers and commuters gathered outside the bustling train station as a series of individual headshots, identity numbers, their offenses and amounts of outstanding court fines rolled across a massive electronic billboard, one after the other, as shown on Chinese state television. Instead of flashing ads, it serves as a public "wall of shame" for those that failed to pay court-ordered fines for violating property disclosure laws, disobeying court orders or failing to respond to subpoenas. The amount of outstanding fines range from 10,000 yuan ($1,600) up to 29 million yuan ($4.5 million). Wang Lifu, a court official, told Hunan city's largest newspaper, Xiaoxiang Morning Post on Wednesday, that it was part of a campaign in the new year to beef up policy implementation measures. Wang added that it was doing a "public service" by exposing the details. According to Chinese Supreme Court regulations, it is legal for local courts to publish private information of people or organizations who have disobeyed court orders. The advertising agency that manages the billboard confirmed with CNN that the court has authorized them to publish personal details of the individuals and companies for two weeks until they pay off their debts. "As of today, we have taken down information of one company and two individuals because they have settled their debts with the courts," said Chen Kai, general manager of Changsha Gaoxun Advertising Company. He added that they did not charge the courts for any advertising fees in support of the court's decision to force debtors to pay. For now, the public also seems to support the court's pressurizing tactics. "Now those people who are dishonest have nowhere to hide, and dare not do it again," Zhou Ya, a man standing outside the railway station told Hunan TV, a local channel. "The court has played hardball by exposing these cheaters, well done!" one passerby told local media. CNN's intern William Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.
China closed 1,355 small coal mines this year, according to Xinhua, the country's state-run press agency. The effort is part of a larger plan to restructure the mining industry to prevent deadly accidents and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Xinhua reported, citing the National Energy Administration (NEA). China has one of the world's deadliest records for miners, with poor safety standards accounting for thousands of deaths each year. According to the China Mining Association, the goal is to eventually boost the industry. Small coal mines, which use outdated technology, will be replaced with larger coal mines, increasing capacity. Davitt McAteer, former press secretary for the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, called the move a response to the consequences of China's "unmitigated economic growth." "If you emphasize production so much ... and you fail to balance the needs of the individual with the needs of the community, you get all kinds of disasters in terms of health and environment," he said. China is the largest global producer and consumer of coal, comprising 75 percent of China's total energy consumption. Approximately 11,000 small coal mines are still in operation.
Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, has called for a generational change in the country's gerontocratic leadership, and urged the government to move faster to implement reforms that would help meet its young population's economic ambitions. "We've had a mystery [in India] where we think that [important] jobs can only be done by 60-yearr-old plus [people]. . . I think we're now fast moving to say that our 40-year-olds can take more responsibility and can perform better," Mr Ambani, 54, told business leaders and policymakers at the World Economic Forum's India Economic Summit in Mumbai. He added that moving towards "leadership [that] reflects our demographics", should be a top priority for the country. The tycoon's call for younger leadership comes as 41-year-old Rahul Gandhi prepares to take greater responsibility in India's ruling Congress party from his ailing mother Sonia, the party president, and as the country's economy recedes from much-wanted double-digit growth. Many political analysts are expecting an imminent transition of power in which Mr Gandhi -- the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty -- takes a more visible role following the treatment of his 64-year-old mother for an unknown illness in the US over the summer. Some expect him to take the party's presidency before crucial elections in Uttar Pradesh next year. About 70 per cent of India's 1.2bn people are under 35. Mr Ambani's call to "align leadership with demographics" is an appeal for greater dynamism in Asia's third largest economy at a time when the administration of Manmohan Singh, the 79-year-old prime minister, is flagging. The opposition Bharatiya Janata party is led by the 83-year old L.K. Advani. Likewise, some of its leading businesses, such as the Tata Group, are led by septuagenarians. One of the top complaints of Mumbai industrialists, alongside high domestic borrowing costs, is paralysis in India's parliament and bureaucracy following a slew of embarrassing high-profile corruption scandals. Mr Singh and his top economic team were absent from the WEF, viewed as a key investment showcase held this year for the first time in India's financial capital. Previously, Mr Singh has used the event to sell his country's prospects to foreign investors. Janmejaya Sinha, the chairman of the Boston Consulting Group in the Asia-Pacific region, said: "The government's record in addressing the big issues is abysmal." "The issues are ethical not economic, but we keep saying it is an economic problem," he said about New Delhi's failure to push through improvements in education, healthcare and power. Mr Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, India's largest family-controlled conglomerate by market capitalisation, emphasised that it was essential for the government to speed up reform to meet the demands of the fast growing private sector. "The reality is that India is a land of a billion opportunities and not of a billion problems," he said.

A scene of devastation emerged Wednesday as circling helicopters broadcast images of housing developments smashed by tornadoes and severe storms that killed at least eight people in south-central Oklahoma Tuesday. Rescue personnel search for potential trapped victims Wednesday in Lone Grove, Oklahoma. Storms ripped roofs off several homes and left twisted metal and other debris scattered across the area. Firefighters and emergency personnel were working with distressed residents. "It just happened really quickly. The sky darkened up and turned really, really green," truck driver Bruce Mundy told CNN from a truck stop in Oklahoma City early Wednesday morning.  Watch aerial footage of destruction » "It was just, like, one after another. As soon as you get calmed down there were more," he said. The storms had moved out of the state Wednesday morning after at least three tornadoes touched down in central and southern Oklahoma Tuesday, the National Weather Service said Wednesday. The one that hit Lone Grove at about 7:30 p.m. had an intensity of EF4 and winds of around 170 mph. The Enhanced Fujita scale measures the intensity of a tornado and its wind speeds based on the type of damage caused and rates it between EF0 and EF5. The first tornado, which hit Edmond between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m., had an intensity ranging between EF0 and EF2, the NWS said. The service has not been able to determine an intensity for another tornado that hit near Langston about an hour later. In the aftermath of the storms, authorities acknowledged a heavy task ahead as emergency personnel and private citizens began the cleanup effort. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video "We're just trying to get stuff in people's hands," store owner Matt Wilson told CNN while handing out pry bars and flashlights to residents at his hardware store in Lone Grove, where heavy damage occurred. "But just about all of Lone Grove is without power."

Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, the head of a network of Christian house churches in Iran, could be executed as soon as midnight Wednesday in Tehran for refusing to recant his religious beliefs and convert to Islam, said the chair of a commission that monitors religious freedom around the world. A statement by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent advisory group appointed by the president and Congress, "expressed deep concern" for the man's fate. After four days of an appeals trial for apostasy, Nadarkhani refused to recant his beliefs. Leonard Leo, chair of the commission, said the pastor "is being asked to recant a faith he has always had. Once again, the Iranian regime has demonstrated that it practices hypocritical barbarian practices." Leo said that while the trial is closed to the press, the commission collects information from sources in Iran and around the world. A release by the group says their responsibility is to "review the facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom internationally." "I would be disappointed if at the end of this whole maelstrom, there was no statement by our government on this situation," Leo said. "At some point the United States has to stand up for the right of this pastor and for human rights more broadly and call countries to account for what they are doing." The commission's statement also called the trial a sham and said Iran is violating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a party. Nadarkhani was first sentenced to execution in November 2010, the commission said, and in order to avoid the death penalty, he is being asked to recant his beliefs and convert to Islam. Leo said an apostasy trial is rare in Iran; the last occurred in 1990. Iran's claim stems from the pastor's Muslim parents. According to Leo, the court needed to verify if Nadarkhani had ever been a Muslim. In order to be given what Iran looks at as the opportunity to recant his beliefs, Nadarkhani must have never been a Muslim before the age of 15, Leo said. Because for the last four days in court he was given the opportunity, it is apparent that the Iranian court found he was never a Muslim and therefore Nadarkhani could have converted. According to a source close to the situation within the Commission on International Religious Freedom, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, would have to sign off on the execution. Speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the subject's sensitivity, the source said these types of issues are always difficult with Iran because of the lack of transparency in how they make decisions on when and how to act. The source also said that in the past, political prisoners have had their prison time and punishment reduced by the Iranian government. Though they did not say that was guaranteed in this situation, the source indicated it was a possibility. The American Center for Law and Justice, a right-leaning organization founded by television evangelist Pat Robertson, reported Wednesday night that Nadarkhani's death sentence punishment had been overturned, meaning that the pastor would be receiving a lower punishment than death. They sourced the claim to someone in Iran. Those reports could not be verified by CNN. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United Nations failed to comment on the ruling. Jordan Sekulow, executive director of the ACLJ, said the outcry from Christians in America has been loud and sustained. "American Christian, like never before, are engaged in this," Sekulow said. "This is evidence that Christians in America over the past decade have done a better job engaging in the persecution issue." Sekulow also said he hopes the White House or State Department will issue a statement on the issue.
A bungled break-in, Deep Throat, a defiant President Richard Nixon declaring, "I am not a crook." These are what often come to mind when people hear the word Watergate. But another legacy of the infamous scandal has re-emerged in this year's presidential race. Many Americans may not remember, but public outrage over Watergate led to the enactment of a series of campaign finance reforms designed to restore the country's faith in government. While the nation marks the 40th anniversary of the Watergate break-in later this year, some observers say our political leaders have already forgotten a key lesson of Watergate: that anonymous money corrupts political campaigns. Opinion: It took a scandal to get real campaign finance reform "Watergate was basically a campaign finance scandal," says Chris Dolan, a political science professor at Lebanon Valley College in Pennsylvania. Dolan and others say this historical amnesia can be seen in the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows corporations and unions to give unlimited campaign donations to so-called super PACs as long as those political action committees are not coordinated with a candidate's campaign. Super PACs can quickly pull in huge amounts of money. They have the option of disclosing their donors and donations either semiannually or quarterly in a nonelection year, and quarterly or monthly in an election year. Critics say super PACs are dangerous because they can delay disclosing details of donations until after elections take place, and they can easily work around restrictions against coordinating with a candidate's campaign. "Citizens United will lead to a future that will make Watergate look tame," Dolan says. "There will be more elections with fewer controls, more spending and great secrecy. The post-Watergate regulations are, in effect, dead." Others say the Watergate reforms actually hurt the election process and that the damage can be seen in this year's presidential race. The post-Watergate restrictions on campaign fundraising inspired savvy political operators to devise more backdoor ways than ever to steer big money to candidates, says political scientist David Schaefer. Campaign operators usually stay ahead of campaign reformers, says Schaefer, a professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. He points to the 2002 McCain-Feingold law as an example. The law set strict limits on contributions to candidates and parties. The result: the rise of "independent" PACs that can receive up to $5,000 from an individual or a national party committee in a calendar year. PACs often make it easier for a candidate's supporters to attack their opponents, Schaefer says. "The candidates cannot be held accountable or responsible for anything PACs say on their behalf, even if there are scurrilous charges that amount to pure mudslinging," he says. A slush fund From the very beginning of Watergate, campaign contributions were intertwined with the scandal. It began on June 17, 1972, when a security guard called Washington police after discovering white masking tape plastered over a door in a sprawling apartment and office complex known as the Watergate. Five men in business suits were arrested for breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee. Investigators later discovered that one of the burglars had a $25,000 check from President Nixon's Committee for the Re-election of the President (known as CRP, or CREEP) deposited in his bank account. Nixon aides had dispatched the burglars to the Democratic headquarters to gather intelligence on his political opponents. To cover up the break-in, the president would take the nation on a two-year series of events that came to be known as Watergate. Before resigning in disgrace in 1974, Nixon would order wiretaps for reporters, misuse the Internal Revenue Service, FBI and CIA for political purposes, and prompt a showdown with the Supreme Court. At the end, 30 government officials were convicted, and a disgusted nation began to lose faith in government. Keeping illegal donations hidden was a prime concern of the Nixon White House after the arrests, says Barry Sussman, a former Washington Post editor who helped lead coverage into the scandal. Nixon didn't just cover up a burglary. His re-election campaign chiefs had asked for and received millions in illegal, secret contributions from major American companies. "They went around with a very heavy hand, telling corporations that we're going to win and you better get on board. You don't want to be against us," says Sussman, author of "The Great Coverup: Nixon and the Scandal of Watergate. "That's called extortion." So much secret money was pouring into the Nixon White House that there were reports of bags of money being delivered to Nixon's re-election campaign, says Gerry Keim, chairman of the management department at Arizona State University's business school. "There was a slush fund," Keim says. "They were extorting money from corporate interests with the threat of using the IRS to audit them if they didn't comply." Corporations expected something in return, and Nixon delivered. His administration intervened in an antitrust action against one corporation that had given it money and relaxed regulations for a milk company that had done the same. Congressional investigators who discovered Nixon's shakedown of corporations decided that the campaign finance system needed to be reformed, says Cornell law professor Robert Hockett. "There was a widespread public perception that the political process had been thoroughly corrupted," Hockett says. "Public policy seemed to be up for sale to the highest bidder." Why reforms faltered Congress attempted to change that perception by passing laws that created a system of public financing for political campaigns. Disclosure laws were enacted to root out secret donors. Limits were placed on campaign donations and private expenditures. (A candidate, for example, can't use campaign money for noncampaign spending.) A bipartisan Federal Election Commission would monitor compliance with the reforms. Yet those reforms were challenged almost as soon as they were enacted. In 1976, a divided Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo stuck down campaign expenditure limits, equating money with free speech. Two decades before the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the judiciary was already gutting Watergate's electoral reforms, Hockett says. "Thanks to Buckley and its progeny, including Citizens United, the post-Watergate electoral reforms have been all but eviscerated," Hockett says. "We basically have little if anything left in the way of meaningful, democracy-protecting campaign finance regulations." Maybe that's just as well, some political scientists say -- that the post-Watergate campaign finance reforms, and others like it, were never destined to last because the flow of money in politics can never be stopped. Big money and secrecy corrupts? The best solution for fighting the potentially corrupting influence of big money in politics, they say, is sunlight. "The real remedy is publicity," says Schaefer, the Holy Cross professor. "It should be illegal to donate to any political candidate beyond a certain figure -- let's say $1,000 -- or even a political action committee without immediately disclosing it on the Internet." Transparency, though, isn't enough when big-money donors are treated like ordinary voters, says former editor Sussman. "That's not 'one man, one vote,' " he says. "Corporations can give all they want. Some speech is overwhelming other forms of speech. That's not democracy." Sussman says many people have forgotten one of the most important lessons of Watergate: that big money and secrecy corrupts. The amount of secret money in this year's presidential race will dwarf the amount Nixon extorted, he says. "Nobody would have predicted that these enormous outlays of secret money would now become legal," he says. But political scientist Peter Hanson says money is such a dominant force in politics that trying to prevent big-money interests from getting involved is like trying to fight nature. Attempted reforms of the campaign finance system date further back than Watergate to the Progressive-era reforms of the early 20th century, says Hanson, an assistant professor at the University of Denver. Demanding transparency in campaign donations may be the most realistic reform possible because it gives voters the information needed to hold candidates accountable, he says. "Money in politics is like the Mississippi River flowing into the ocean," Hanson says. "You're not going to stop the river. You have to direct it in the ways that will best protect public integrity."
Something about the Facebook privacy hoax has gotten people to click "share." First, the faux copyright legalese spread like wildfire across the social networking site. Many users recently found their news feeds awash with postings suggesting that the users who displayed them would get extra copyright and privacy protection. Then came the predictable backlash, as Internet users rushed in to debunk this latest theory. Even still, some people kept posting the message and it continued to spread on Tuesday morning. Facebook has issued a statement saying the text posts are a hoax: "Anyone who uses Facebook owns and controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms. They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been." This meme is similar to a previous scheme years ago that suggested website owners place protective text on their pages, says the hoax-debunking site Snopes.com. While many Facebook and Twitter posts snickered about the hubbub, concerns about online privacy linger. "It may have been a hoax, but it did not hurt!" wrote one Facebook user. There are questions, too. In a world of social media dominated by complex terms of use and sometimes-fuzzy privacy arrangements, could some Facebook users have taken solace in the possibility of having some bit of extra control over their data, even if it was a hoax? Or, is this an issue of social media literacy? Perhaps more needs to be done to educate people about telling a hoax from something that is real. We'd like to know what you think about the hoax. What does this say about our online world? Do you feel that your information is safe? What can be done to improve online privacy?

A British tourist in the United States for his 41st wedding anniversary was killed in the crash of a vintage World War II-era plane in the waters off of Galveston, Texas, authorities said Thursday. John Stephen Busby, 66, was visiting the area with his wife, police said. The pilot, identified as Keith Hibbett, 51, of Shady Shores, Texas, was also killed in Wednesday's crash. The P-51 Mustang was owned by the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston. Known in recent years as the "Galveston Gal," the plane was used to give rides. Busby was a paying customer, said Sgt. John Sampa of the Texas Highway Patrol. The crash between Chocolate Bay and Galveston Bay was reported to the Coast Guard by the captain of a charter fishing boat shortly before noon. A Coast Guard-led search found the plane in about three to five feet of water in an area known as West Bay. Both occupants were dead, officials said. Federal Aviation Administration records show the plane was built in 1944. According to the museum's website, it was converted to a two-seat, dual-control training aircraft while serving in the El Salvadoran Air Force in the 1960s. In recent years, it was painted with the "Galveston Gal" markings and was used to give people a flight experience for about $2,000 a flight. The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation. In 2011, a highly-modified P-51 Mustang crashed into a group of spectators at the Reno Air Races in Nevada, killing the pilot and 10 others, and injuring more than 60 people.

The mission is anything but a Mickey Mouse task: Navigate the world's most treacherous seas, crossing 73,000 nautical kilometers in a confined space with stressed-out, sleep-deprived crewmates. That's the challenge facing two sailors -- Charlie Enright and Mark Towill -- who met on the set of a Disney movie. "When they say this is the hardest race in the world, that's true," Towill tells CNN as he reflects on the Volvo Ocean Race, a grueling feat of endurance where competitors will face 30-meter waves in the Southern Ocean and winds of 110 kph (68 mph). With such conditions, tragedy is always a risk -- Dutch sailor Hans Horrevoets died in the 2005-06 race when he was swept overboard. The nine-month event begins in Alicante, Spain, on Saturday. Its eventual finish in June in Gothenburg, Sweden, will mark the longest route in the event's 42-year history. Not surprisingly Towill, general manager of Team Alvimedica, describes the buildup as the "calm before the storm," while Enright admits it is impossible to predict what lies ahead in the coming months away from family and friends. To add a further twist in the marathon journey ahead, the American pair's crew is the youngest in the race -- skipper Enright is 30 while Towill is just 25. They are reunited seven years after meeting on the set of Morning Light -- the brainchild of Roy Disney Jnr., a nephew of the company's legendary founder Walt. Roy Disney, who died in 2009 a year after its release, came up with the idea of getting a crew of aged 18 to 23 to compete in the Transpacific Yacht Race from San Pedro in California to Honolulu in Hawaii. Hundreds applied but just 15 were selected, among them Towill and Enright. "I just put my application in at the last minute as my flatmates did it," says Enright. "I loved every minute." From day one, despite the five-year age gap and differing backgrounds, the pair struck up a friendship that's still going strong. Enright hails from Rhode Island, a state awash with sailors, while Towill, from Hawaii, was the first in his family to take an interest in sailing. "They wouldn't know what the boom or the spinnaker pole was but they're my biggest supporters," says Towill, who followed his newfound friend to Ivy League university Brown where they studied and sailed. Coached by Volvo Ocean Race sailors, they took on board every nugget of information they could about offshore racing before signing up in 2011 to the race's development program, learning the business side of getting together a team and the finances required. They worked tirelessly to get sponsors before Alvimedica, a medical technologies company that had already been liaising with race organizers, became a financial backer. Both parties' involvement was made possible by a cost-cutting rule for the 2014-15 race which meant teams would no longer make their own boats but use a centrally built Volvo Ocean 65 one-design vessel by Farr Yacht Design. It brought down the price of entering a team from $70 million to $21 million. "It's a fairytale story," says Towill, recalling the surprisingly swift sealing of the deal. "Alvimedica is a young company growing rapidly and we are a young team, so it was the perfect fit with American sailors -- and America's a big market for them." That sole meeting spilled over to dinner, followed by a night out which eventually ended at 1 a.m. with a handshake to confirm the partnership. Enright and Towill needed to be up at 6 a.m. for a flight home but snuck out for another drink on their own to celebrate what they had achieved. For Enright, it was the realization of a lifelong ambition. He recalls in grade two at school putting together a project on the Whitbread Round The World race, set up in 1972 and by which it was known until Volvo became the title sponsor in 2001. "It's the pinnacle of offshore racing, which is what I like most, and it just became a natural ambition," he says. As skipper, he knows the buck stops with him on the water and he admits he thrives on both the pressure and responsibility of seven other sailors relying on him for their direction and personal safety. Throughout the race, he will work closely with Towill as always, who he calls the yin to his yang, both with the shared aim "to keep each other honest." Towill admits to having gone into hibernation in the buildup to the race, knowing that there will only be snippets of sleep in the next nine months, and he expects their friendship will be tested. "I'd be lying if I said it was going to be peachy all the time," says Towill, who turned down a job in renewable energy in San Francisco to follow his sailing ambitions. "There's eight guys on a boat with not much space, stress and a lack of sleep. The dynamic of how we are as a group is important." Amid the young guns on board, Australian navigator Will Oxley will provide experience. By the end of the race, the Volvo veteran will have turned 50 and sailed competitively more than the distance to the moon during an impressive career. Oxley's advice to Enright has been to "keep it all in perspective." The two young sailors and their crew will also be hoping for a Disney ending. In pictures: The Everest of sailing?
Leeland Eisenberg is missing yet again. The 52-year-old New Hampshire man, who took hostages six years ago at one of Hillary Clinton's campaign offices, was not in his Manchester halfway house when he was supposed to be Sunday afternoon, according to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections. Authorities say they are considering it an escape because Eisenberg did not let anyone know he was leaving, as he is required to do. They said he is not considered armed or dangerous. This is at least the second time Eisenberg has left authorities wondering about his whereabouts. He was released in 2009 after serving two thirds of a three-year sentence. But in February 2010, he violated his probation by cutting off his GPS tracking bracelet. He was arrested about a day later and eventually received a new sentence of 3 1/2 to 7 years. He is eligible for parole in August. Eisenberg has a history of mental illness and substance-abuse problems, authorities say. In 2007, he entered Clinton's campaign office in Rochester, New Hampshire, with road flares strapped to his chest. He claimed he had a bomb, and he held several hostages for five hours. Clinton was in Washington at the time. In an interview with CNN in 2007, Eisenberg said he took the hostages to raise awareness about mental health issues. "I wanted to sacrifice myself for mental illness and bring about the discussion about mental illness," Eisenberg said. Furthermore, he said, "I wanted the police to kill me." He was convicted of multiple counts of kidnapping, criminal threatening and false reports of explosives. CNN's Elwyn Lopez and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CNN ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWSROOM: We're being told by a White House official that the president will make a statement at 10:30. WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR, THE SITUATION ROOM WITH WOLF BLITZER: I'm told by sources it is a national security issue. JOHN KING, CNN HOST, JOHN KING, USA: CNN is told by several sources now that the president of the United States will announce in just moments that the United States has the body of Osama bin Laden. BLITZER: And now the president will tell us officially bin Laden is dead. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: That was the breaking news late Sunday night after we recorded yesterday's show. In today's special edition of CNN Student News, we're going in depth into the death of Osama bin Laden. First Up: Osama bin Laden Killed AZUZ: He was a terrorist, one of the FBI's most wanted criminals, and the mastermind behind the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Now, Osama bin Laden is dead. Sunday, a U.S. military operation involving Navy SEALs assaulted the compound, this mansion, where bin Laden was hiding out in Pakistan. He and four other people were killed. U.S. officials say they've used DNA testing to confirm that the body is that of bin Laden. One of his wives also identified the body for U.S. forces. Obviously, a very significant moment for the United States and for people around the world. To understand just how big this news is, take a look back. Osama bin Laden had been a terrorist for decades. In 1988, he founded al Qaeda, which became a terrorist network three years later. In 1992, bin Laden was accused of sending some of his followers to fight U.S. forces that were in the African nation of Somalia. And a year later, a bomb exploded at New York's World Trade Center. Bin Laden was one of several people suspected of being involved. 1996: Osama bin Laden declared a "jihad," or holy war, against U.S. forces. Two years after that, he was charged with the murders of 224 people; they died in the bombings at U.S. embassies in the African countries of Kenya and Tanzania. He appeared on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" list in 1999. And he was linked to the bombing of a U.S. Navy ship -- the USS Cole -- that killed 17 sailors in the year 2000. September 11th, 2001: Osama bin Laden was behind the attacks that killed nearly three thousand people on U.S. soil. The events and images of that day seared into the memories of so many Americans. Four planes hijacked by al Qaeda terrorists: Two were flown into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York. Both of those would later collapse. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon, near Washington, D.C. And the fourth crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, in a field, after passengers fought back against the hijackers. It was, again, the worst terrorist attack ever on American soil. It led to the U.S.-led war on terrorism, the war in Afghanistan. And now, the man behind it, Osama bin Laden, is dead. The Operation Timeline AZUZ: "Justice has been done." That's what President Obama said when he announced bin Laden's death. He also spoke about what this moment means for the United States. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, that we have never forgotten your loss nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores. And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11. I know that it has, at times, frayed. Yet today's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people. The cause of securing our country is not complete, but tonight we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to. That is the story of our history. Whether it's the pursuit of prosperity for our people or the struggle for equality for all our citizens, our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place. Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. AZUZ: Former President George W. Bush, who was in office on September 11th, 2001, released a statement Sunday night about bin Laden's death. Mr. Bush said, "This momentous achievement marks a victory for America, for people who seek peace around the world and for all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001. The fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done." So, how did the U.S. find bin Laden? Jeanne Meserve details the events that led up to bin Laden's death. (BEGIN VIDEO) OBAMA: I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden. JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: U.S. officials say it began last August when new leads came to light about the possible whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. OBAMA: It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside Pakistan. MESERVE: The key lead: tracking one of the few couriers trusted by bin Laden. Then, last Friday, President Obama authorized an operation to get the head of al Qaeda. That operation happened Sunday in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad. Bin Laden was in a large compound originally built on the outskirts of town, reachable only by a dirt road. Over time, more homes had been built around it. U.S. officials say the compound had 12-18 foot walls topped with barbed wire and what's being called extraordinary security. A third floor terrace had a seven-foot privacy wall. Only a small group inside the U.S. government knew about the operation carried out by Navy SEALs in helicopters. OBAMA: A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. MESERVE: The operation lasted about 40 minutes. Though a U.S. helicopter crashed due to mechanical reasons, there were no U.S. casualties. Bin Laden resisted the assault and was killed in the firefight, shot in the head. (END VIDEO) Reaction AZUZ: As the news of bin Laden's death came out on Sunday night, a crowd started forming outside the gates at the White House. People turning out to celebrate the news. There was a patriotic spirit to the spontaneous gathering. Listen. CROWD: And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave. O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? AZUZ: Similar crowds at cities around the U.S. That includes in New York, where people gathered at Ground Zero, the spot where the Twin Towers once stood. The reactions weren't all celebrations, though. Gordon Felt is the president of the Familes of Flight 93. That's the 9/11 plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. Discussing bin Laden's death, he said "it cannot ease our pain or bring back our loved ones. It does bring a measure of comfort that the face of global terror can no longer spread his evil." U.S. and Pakistan AZUZ: This is the compound, the mansion, where Osama bin Laden was found in Pakistan. It's in a city called Abbottabad, about 100 miles away from Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. There are some disagreements between the U.S. and Pakistan over how much info the Pakistani government had about the assault on the compound. But both countries agree that information from Pakistan helped lead U.S. forces to the place. The two countries agreed to work together to fight terrorists, but the U.S. and Pakistan have had some problems with each other recently. The United States says Pakistan hasn't been putting enough pressure on terrorist groups. Pakistan is angry about American attacks against terrorists inside Pakistani borders. Increased Precautions AZUZ: One question that comes up is how al Qaeda might react to bin Laden's death. A U.S. official said the government expects threats of retaliation, pointing out that al Qaeda declared war on the U.S. more than a decade ago. Security was increased at military facilities around the country. More officers on patrol at the U.S. Capitol. American embassies in other countries put on high alert, and the government gave a travel warning for Americans overseas. Looking Ahead AZUZ: U.S. forces took bin Laden's body out of that compound in Pakistan. Islamic law says the burial has to happen with 24 hours. Since there was no alternative on land, bin Laden's body was buried at sea. U.S. officials said they made all efforts to follow Islamic burial rules. But the death of bin Laden does not mean the end of the U.S.-led war on terror. Here's what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to say. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: Even as we mark this milestone, we should not forget that the battle to stop al Qaeda and its syndicate of terror will not end with the death of bin Laden. Indeed, we must take this opportunity to renew our resolve and redouble our efforts. Goodbye AZUZ: A historic moment for the United States in the fight against terrorists, and for people around the world. Global reaction is pouring in to us, and we want to hear what's going through your mind, too. You can share your thoughts on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com.

Unsteady cables and stronger-than-expected winds added drama, but Nik Wallenda's high-wire walk above a Florida highway looked like a walk in the park Tuesday. The 600-foot stroll was on a cable strung 180 feet above U.S. Highway 41 along the Sarasota, Florida, bay front. The 34-year-old, who hails from multiple generations of high-flying daredevils, was not wearing a safety tether, and there was no net below to catch him if he fell. "Props to my great-grandfather Karl Wallenda, because I can almost guarantee you he would have stopped in the middle of this cable and have done a headstand," he said near the halfway point. Daredevil completes walk across Niagara Falls His great-grandfather Karl Wallenda died at 73, attempting to walk between two buildings in Puerto Rico in 1978. Last June, Wallenda captured the nation's attention during his 25-minute agonizing amble above the roaring rapids of Niagara Falls. He carried his passport in his pocket for that historic walk from the United States to Canada, but this one was in his hometown. "I'm risking my life on every single one of them, so there's no difference" the younger aerialist said as he walked. "My great-grandfather did many amazing walks around the world. The one that took his life was minuscule in comparison." Thousands watched from 180 feet below and television cameras broadcast it live to the world, a stunt intended to promote Wallenda's performance with his wife and other family members at Circus Sarasota. Since the permit allowed the highway to be closed for just an hour, Wallenda's crew had just 15 minutes to adjust the stabilizing cables. Wallenda complained at times that it was "really sloppy." "Holy crap," he said. "Come on guys, it's horrible." Despite the danger, he kept calm and joked with his father: "Who do I need to spank when I get down?" Wallenda took the last step onto the roof of a condo building nine minutes after he took the first one. CNN's Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.
I work at an inland university in chilly upstate New York. Around here, many people feel a little global warming is good and there is really nothing that they can see or hear that will make them feel differently. News of warming sea surfaces and bleached coral reefs inspire little response when there's a chill in the air and the ocean is hundreds of miles away. Sure, the ice is off the lakes a few weeks earlier and the growing season is a couple of weeks longer. But there are costs we are seeing now -- mosquitoes, ticks and other species of insects are really thriving with the warmer weather while some species of trees, like sugar maple, are suffering slow declines. However, none of these small, incremental impacts gives one a sense of imminent disaster, but the reality is that increased sea-surface temperatures will impact hundreds of millions of people, whether they live in Key West or Kalamazoo. In contrast to the incremental changes we are seeing here in the heartland, the sea is already undergoing catastrophic changes on a massive scale, ones that are unprecedented in human history and that may be largely irreversible on human time scales. During the past few months, coral bleaching near Aceh, Indonesia, in the Coral Triangle and in the Andaman Sea of Southeast Asia has left vast tracts of reefs impacted, with up to 80 percent of the corals dead or dying at some sites. Bleaching occurs when corals get so thermally stressed that the symbiotic relationship with their solar-powered algae falls apart, and the pigmented algae get expelled. The result is a bleached reef that looks starkly white because the white skeleton underlying the coral skin shows through. Imagine if overnight all of the leaves on the trees in your neighborhood turned white from losing their photosynthetic pigments. Then think about what it would look like if more than half of those trees didn't recover and died. Coral reefs are an ecosystem rich in biodiversity beyond our wildest imagining -- we are still discovering the countless links that support transforming nutrient- poor tropical oceans into an oasis of life. Reefs provide a home to countless small crabs, worms, starfish and rich zooplankton which hide in the reef by day and come out at night to be a rich banquet for fish. Young fish shelter and feed in the reef, until large enough to survive elsewhere. Gobies are an example of a small reef fish that shows big declines on reefs affected by bleaching; the butterfly fish also is a species that feeds directly on coral and so declines with reef damage. Reefs that have bleached and died quickly erode and cannot fix carbon from the sun or provide habitat for fish. Even as I write this, I am anticipating that one of the largest bleaching events in the history of the Caribbean is under way. We don't know yet if this event will become the largest because it has not reached its peak. I have checked NOAA's Coral Reef Watch website every week this August and September to monitor the sea surface temperatures and to try to guess at what level they might peak. Currently, the trajectory is on course to be markedly warmer than the record-breaking summer of 2005. During that year of record-breaking bleaching and devastating hurricanes, including Katrina, scientists identified the extreme sea surface temperatures as a once-in-a-100-year event. Well, here we are five years later, and with a month to go before the expected temperature maximum during mid-October, it looks like we are in for a greater once-in-a-100-year event in the space of five years! So, this raises the question -- does this really matter to folks in the heartland? Does it matter that nobody is even aware that this huge event is even going on? Well, it matters if we care about global biodiversity, since those reefs in the Coral Triangle are at the center of both fish and coral biodiversity. It also matters if we care about the people who make their living on the fish, snails, crabs, and other animals that live on the reefs in the Coral Triangle, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean -- and the people who eat seafood in your town and every town. It matters if we are concerned about future tsunamis in the Indo-Pacific because those reefs are the strongest wavebreaks known to protect fragile coastal communities. And finally, it matters because coral reefs fuel billions in tourist dollars to fragile economies in the developing world as well as in our territorial waters. So, for people who are concerned about the fate of the global environment and human civilization, it does matter. We are an ocean nation with vast areas of coral reefs. The exclusive economic zone of the US includes not only a 200-mile coastal zone around our fifty states, but a 200-mile zone around rich marine resources in the Pacific, including Guam, Midway Island, Palmyra Atoll and American Samoa. It is important to realize that the effects of climate change are being felt more directly in the oceans than on land. Just because they are out of sight does not mean that they should be out of mind. Most people have not experienced firsthand the already disastrous impacts of climate change on our ocean. But soon enough we will start to notice disruptions in terrestrial ecosystems as well. To help coral reefs and other affected coastal ecosystems, much more stringent management policies must be implemented to control overfishing and land-based pollution. This can improve the resilience of these climate-stressed ecosystems. In the larger policy arena, to slow this sea surface warming we must not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we have to figure out a way to get the CO2 concentration below the level of the 388 parts per million it is at now. The target of 350 ppm CO2 advocated by 350.org movement is a way forward if future generations are to benefit from the services coral reefs provide and the sense of awe that they inspire.

Gabrielle "Gabby" Giffords stood next to her husband in court Thursday as he spoke directly to Jared Loughner, the Arizona man who tried to assassinate the then-congresswoman in a January 2011 shooting. "Mr. Loughner, you may have put a bullet through her head, but you haven't put a dent in her spirit and her commitment to make the world a better place," former astronaut Mark Kelly said. Giffords was seriously wounded when Loughner walked up and shot her in the head during her meet-and-greet event with constituents outside a Tucson grocery store on January 8, 2011. A federal judge, a congressional aide and four others were killed and 12 other people suffered wounds. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns sentenced Loughner to serve the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole. The punishment includes seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years. "The evidence clearly shows that he knew what he was doing, despite his mental illness," the judge said. Loughner, 24, spoke just once, confirming to the judge that he would make no statement before sentencing. "That is true," he said. Giffords shooting survivors seek federal help in tightening gun laws Beside the dramatic appearance by Giffords and her husband, nine other victims spoke at the sentencing hearing held in a packed federal courtroom in Tuscon. Kelly, in an interview Thursday evening with CNN's Piers Morgan, said hearing what they had to say "was really a tough thing" for Giffords. "Gabby said afterwards, for her the biggest emotion was just sadness," Kelly said. "To hear story after story of what the impact of this horrible day had on people was really difficult." Much of the time, those words were directed toward the 24-year-old Loughner, whose lawyer stroked his arm at times. "You pointed a weapon at me and shot me," said Susan Hileman, who was wounded by Loughner's Glock pistol. "Over last several months, I wanted to take you by the shoulders and shake you and scream at you." "It's an awful situation," she said, looking straight at Loughner, "and it's all because of you." His victims gathered that day "to witness democracy in action," she said. "We brought family and friends. You brought a gun." Mavanell Stoddard described how her "precious husband," Dorwin Stoddard, was fatally shot as he fell on top of her to shield her from the onslaught of bullets. "Somehow when you shot him, I got out from under him," Stoddard said. "I was screaming 'Oh God, oh God, help me.' I said to him 'breathe deeply,' and he did. Therefore, I believe that he heard me said 'I love you.' " He died in her arms her minutes later, she said. "Then I passed out because you had shot me three times," she said. "You took away my life, my love, my reason for living." "I am so lonesome," Stoddard said as she stared directly at Loughner. "I hate living without him. No one to hold me, no one to love me, no one to talk to, no one to care. I forgive you. As a Christian, I am required to." Giffords leads crowd in pledge at vigil marking 1 year since shooting Mary Reed, who was among the wounded, blamed Loughner for introducing "my children to something sinister and evil." "My children will forever remember the moments of people when they died, the smell of blood everywhere," Reed said. "Jared took their lives, their bodies, but he will not take their spirit," victim Pat Maisch said. Pamela Simon, one of the Giffords congressional aides who was wounded, said Loughner is reminder "of our society's failure to provide adequate mental health." "Jared, I know you did not choose this illness that led to this horrific tragedy," Simon said. "When you were a student in middle school, and I was a teacher there at the same time. You were a regular kid." U.S. Rep. Ron Barber also spoke. "The physical and mental wounds will be with us forever," said Barber, who was hit in the leg by a bullet. He spoke of watching congressional aide Gabe Zimmerman -- "one of my dearest colleagues" -- die. "He was my go-to guy, a human being with so much compassion," Barber said. Barber won a special election to fill Giffords' congressional seat after she stepped down a year after the shooting. "We are thankful she survived your attempt to take her life," Barber told Loughner. "You did not take away her compassion and desire to serve. In fact, the whole world knows of this great leader. She remains the model of bipartisanship and political courage." Barber told the court he supports a life sentence for Loughner. "I hold no hatred for you, but I am very angry and sick at heart about what you have done and the hurt you have caused all of us," Barber told Loughner. "You now must bear this burden and never again see the outside of a prison." 19 months after mass shooting, Giffords moves back to Tucson Mark Kelly, who was training for a space shuttle mission when he learned his wife was shot, spoke for her as she watched. "Gabby would trade her own life to bring back any one of those you savagely murdered on that day," he said. The statement noted each of the dead. "And then there is what you took from Gabby," Kelly said, looking at Loughner. "Her life has been forever changed. Plans she had for our family and her career have been immeasurably altered. Every day is a continuous struggle to do those things she was once so very good at. His wife now struggles to walk, an arm is paralyzed and she is partially blind, he said. She stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery. "Mr. Loughner, by making death and producing tragedy, you sought to extinguish the beauty of life," Kelly said. "To diminish potential. To strain love. And to cancel ideas. You tried to create for all of us a world as dark and evil as your own. But know this, and remember it always: You failed." Directing his comments away from Loughner for a moment, Kelly said "There's something else Gabby and I have been spending a lot of time thinking about. " "The way we conduct politics must change," he said. "Sure, it's easier to win a debate if you can turn your opponent into a demon, but that's not how we move forward. Not only does slash-and-burn politics make Americans cynical about their leaders, but it leads to bad ideas. It creates problems instead of solving the ones we have now. Kelly concluded with words directed again at the defendant. "Mr. Loughner, pay close attention to this: Though you are mentally ill, you are responsible for the death and hurt you inflicted upon all of us on January 8th of last year," he said. You know this. Gabby and I know this. Everyone in this courtroom knows this. You have decades upon decades to contemplate what you did. But after today. After this moment. Here and now. Gabby and I are done thinking about you." He pleaded guilty to 19 charges in exchange for the life sentence to avoid facing the death penalty. He had been facing more than 50 federal charges. "Mr. Loughner, you have been given a gift, whether you know it or not," Assistant U.S. Attorney Wallace Kleindienst said, just before recommending a life sentence. "Almost all the victims you shot and the families of those you killed came to us and said they didn't want us to seek the death penalty in this case." Under the pleas, Loughner admitted guilt in the wounding of Giffords and the murders of federal employees U.S. District Court Chief Judge John M. Roll, 63, and congressional aide Gabriel M. Zimmerman, 30, prosecutors said. Loughner also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of federal employees and congressional aides Ronald S. Barber, 65, and Pamela K. Simon, 63, prosecutors said. Loughner also admitted causing the deaths of Christina-Taylor Green, 9; Dorothy "Dot" J. Morris, 76; Phyllis C. Schneck, 79; and Dorwan C. Stoddard, 76, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said Loughner admitted injuring with a Glock pistol 10 people participating at an activity provided by the U.S. government and creating a grave risk of death to 13 more people. Prosecutors agreed to the plea deal after taking into account Loughner's history of mental illness and the views of victims and their families. The judge in August ruled Loughner competent to stand trial. Warning signs of violence: What to do CNN's Dana Bash and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.
It's another case of horse meat being found in products that are not supposed to contain it. Furniture giant Ikea said Thursday it pulled hotdogs from its stores in Russia after tests revealed they contained rogue horse meat. Dozens of processed meat products have been pulled by European suppliers, retailers and food outlets in the past several weeks after the discovery of unauthorized horse meat in them. Opinion: Scandal shines spotlight on murky horse trade Ikea said in a statement Thursday it had undertaken wide-scale testing of its meat products from different suppliers in all its markets. "The vast majority of these tests show no indication of horse meat. However, there are also a few tests that do. In those cases we remove the product from sales," the company said. "IKEA Group is committed to serving and selling high quality food that is safe, healthy and produced with care for the environment." The test result from Russia concerns locally produced hotdogs and only affects the Russian market, Ikea said. The alert over the hotdogs has added to what has been a difficult couple of weeks for Ikea. What's behind the horsemeat contamination scandal? Ten days ago, the company suspended sales of its Swedish meatballs after testing in the Czech Republic revealed traces of horse DNA. Testing since has revealed the presence of horse meat in a few samples of Ikea meatballs from a supplier in Sweden, the firm said Thursday. Ikea also said Tuesday it was withdrawing its almond cake with chocolate and butterscotch from sale in 23 countries after traces of coliform bacteria -- organisms found in the environment and in the feces of warm-blooded animals and humans -- were found in two batches. The horse meat scandal has extended across Europe, with questions raised over slaughterhouses and food suppliers in a number of countries. The UK Food Standards Agency released the results Friday of the latest round of testing ordered on products labeled beef across the UK food industry. Horse: Coming soon to a meat case near you? So far, more than 99% of tests continue to show no horse DNA at or above the level of 1%, it said. Horse meat is not harmful in itself but authorities are concerned by its unauthorized presence in case it is tainted with a veterinary drug used to treat horses. Phenylbutazone, also known as bute, is not allowed to enter the food chain because it can pose a risk to humans. The European Union said last month it intends to begin testing meat across all 27 member states.
Nearly one in four people worldwide is Muslim -- and they are not necessarily where you might think, according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global Muslim population. Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia. India, a majority-Hindu country, has more Muslims than any country except for Indonesia and Pakistan, and more than twice as many as Egypt. China has more Muslims than Syria. Germany has more Muslims than Lebanon. And Russia has more Muslims than Jordan and Libya put together. Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia. The Middle East and north Africa, which together are home to about one in five of the world's Muslims, trail a very distant second. There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, "Mapping the Global Muslim Population," by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. That represents about 23 percent of the total global population of 6.8 billion. There are about 2.25 billion Christians, based on projections from the 2005 World Religions Database. Brian Grim, the senior researcher on the Pew Forum project, was slightly surprised at the number of Muslims in the world, he told CNN. "Overall, the number is higher than I expected," he said, noting that earlier estimates of the global Muslim population have ranged from 1 billion to 1.8 billion. The report can -- and should -- have implications for United States policy, said Reza Aslan, the best-selling Iranian-American author of "No God but God." "Increasingly, the people of the Middle East are making up a smaller and smaller percentage of the worldwide Muslim community," he told CNN by phone. "When it comes to issues of outreach to the Muslim world, these numbers will indicate that outreach cannot be focused so narrowly on the Middle East," he said. "If the goal is to create better understanding between the United States and the Muslim world, our focus should be on south and southeast Asia, not the Middle East," he said. He spoke to CNN before the report was published and without having seen its contents, but was familiar with the general trends the report identified. The team at the Pew Forum spent nearly three years analyzing "the best available data" from 232 countries and territories, Grim said. Their aim was to get the most comprehensive snapshot ever assembled of the world's Muslim population at a given moment in time. So they took the data they gathered from national censuses and surveys, and projected it forward based on what they knew about population growth in each country. They describe the resulting report as "the largest project of its kind to date." It's full of details that even the researchers found surprising. "There are these countries that we don't think of as Muslim at all, and yet they have very sizable numbers of Muslims," said Alan Cooperman, the associate director of research for the Pew Forum, naming India, Russia and China. One in five of the world's Muslims lives in a country where Muslims are a minority. And while most people think of the Muslim population of Europe is being composed of immigrants, that's only true in western Europe, Cooperman said. "In the rest of Europe -- Russia, Albania, Kosovo, those places -- Muslims are an indigenous population," he said. "More than half of the Muslims in Europe are indigenous." The researchers also were surprised to find the Muslim population of sub-Saharan Africa to be as low as they concluded, Cooperman said. It has only about 240 million Muslims -- about 15 percent of all the world's Muslims. Islam is thought to be growing fast in the region, with countries such as Nigeria, which has large populations of both Christians and Muslims, seeing violence between the two groups. The Pew researchers concluded that Nigeria is just over half Muslim, making it the sixth most populous Muslim country in the world. Roughly nine out of 10 Muslims worldwide are Sunni, and about one in 10 is Shiite, they estimated. They warned they were less confident of those numbers than of the general population figures because sectarian data is harder to come by. "Only one or two censuses in the world ... have ever asked the sectarian question," said Grim. "Among Muslims it's a very sensitive question. If asked, large numbers will say I am just a Muslim -- not that they don't know, but it is a sensitive question in many places," he said. One in three of the world's Shiite Muslims lives in Iran, which is one of only four countries with a Shiite majority, he said. The others are Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Bahrain. Huge as the project of mapping the world's Muslim population is, it is only the first step in a Pew Forum undertaking. Next year, the think tank intends to release a report projecting Muslim population growth into the future, and then the researchers intend to do the whole thing over again with Christians, followed by other faith groups. "We don't care only about Muslims," Grim said. They're also digging into what people believe and practice, since the current analysis doesn't analyze that. "This is no way reflects the religiosity of people, only their self-identification," Grim said. "We're trying to get the overall picture of religion in the world."
A plane carrying Madagascar's ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana was turned away from Madagascan airspace Saturday as he tried to return from exile, his spokesman and the airline said. Ravalomanana, who had been in South Africa in exile, took off from Johannesburg Saturday morning in what was his second bid to return to his home country. But Ravalomanana's spokesman Patrick Gearing, in South Africa, told CNN that the civil aviation authorities on the Indian Ocean island had closed the airspace, refusing the plane permission to land. By Saturday afternoon the plane -- and Ravalomanana -- were back in South Africa, said Gearing. Ravalomanana was ousted in March 2009 through a coup backed by the military, which handed power to current President Andry Rajoelina, the youthful former mayor of Antananarivo. Shortly before boarding his flight to the capital, Antananarivo, Ravalomanana said that he had just spoken with the Madagascan Prime Minister Omer Beriziky, who told him "everything was OK." Speaking before the flight took off, Gearing said: "He has no control over what will happen to him when he arrives but he is prepared to face whatever comes his way." Ravalomanana's previous unsuccessful effort to return last year came to an end in Johannesburg, when the airline he was using was told it wouldn't be allowed to land if he was on board. Madagascar is in the process of implementing a peace agreement facilitated by a regional body, the South African Development Community. Gearing says Ravalomanana met with South Africa's President Jacob Zuma Friday to thank him for letting him stay following his ouster. U.S. and South African diplomatic sources tell CNN his return would be catastrophic for any peace process going forward. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.
A DNA link may signal a break in a 36-year-old investigation into the slaying of four children, the Oakland County, Michigan, prosecutor's office announced Tuesday. The so-called Oakland County Child Killer is believed to be responsible for the deaths of Mark Stebbins, 12, Jill Robinson, 12, Kristine Mihelich, 10, and Timothy King, 11, who were kidnapped and found dead between 1976 and 1977. Using technology unavailable to investigators at the time of the crimes, the FBI DNA unit at Quantico tested and analyzed human hairs found on the bodies of Stebbins and King, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators were able to establish a mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, profile link between the hairs, establishing they came from the same person, essentially proving the two crimes were connected. Source: DNA at Occupy protest similar to material on victim's CD player "This is the first piece of evidence that actually links any of the victims together. It was always believed that these two killings were linked to the same person, however that was an assumption based on the similarities in the crime," said Jessica R. Cooper, Oakland County Prosecutor. Armed with proof the boys' death was connected, authorities pulled up more evidence from the 1970s investigation. At the time, police had found a person of interest and were able to search his car. The car was a 1966 Pontiac Bonneville. The investigators took samples from the interior of the car and found small hairs, fibers and fur. They were placed in evidence where they remained for decades, until this material, too, was submitted to the FBI DNA unit for testing and analysis. According to prosecutors, the testing revealed that the hairs recovered from the Bonneville had the same mtDNA profile as the hairs recovered from the boys' bodies. The owner of the car, 70-year-old Archibald "Ed" Sloan, is serving a life sentence for two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Sloan was tested for a DNA match, but it was determined he did not share the same DNA profile: The hairs found on the boys and in the car were not his. "It is believed that Sloan would allow others to use his 1966 Bonneville, as well as the other described vehicles, so investigators are looking for information concerning any other people who may have used this car, or had access to any of these vehicles. Finding anyone like this who turns out to be the donor of the hair may be the key to solving these two murders," Cooper said. Cold case: 'Dating Game' suspect pleads not guilty The mtDNA results are not absolute. According to prosecutors, the hairs recovered from the boys' bodies were not suitable for autosomal DNA testing, or nuclear DNA testing, the testing most commonly referred to in movies and television. Investigators had to use mtDNA testing, which is less definitive than autosomal DNA testing. "With nuclear, autosomal DNA ... you're dealing with absolute identification. It's like a fingerprint, unique to each person except twins," said Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky, forensic scientist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, "Mitochondrial DNA is completely different. If you have a hair from a person, that person's siblings and all maternal relatives would share that mitochondrial profile. It's not unique to a particular person." On the other hand, Kobilinsky said an mtDNA link is still significant, and enough to cast suspicion on anyone who shares the mtDNA profile, "People have been convicted on mtDNA evidence alone," he said. Authorities are hopeful the new evidence will help them catch the killer. "We are excited about this new opportunity," said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, "This haunts every police officer who was around then and is around today." Authorities encourage anyone with information to call the tip line at 1-800-442-7766. TV movie on 'Green River Killer' leads to ID of remains of woman missing since '82
A man accused of entering New York's LaGuardia Airport with a bag containing wires and batteries has been indicted on terror-related charges. Scott McGann, 32, faces an August 18 arraignment after he undergoes a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation. Scott McGann, 32, was indicted Wednesday on charges of placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the first degree; placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in a transportation facility; and making terrorist threats, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. If convicted, McGann faces up to seven years in prison, Brown's office said Friday. McGann initially appeared in court Saturday, but his arraignment was postponed until August 18 pending a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Brown's office said. McGann is being held at the Bellevue Hospital prison ward, according to the New York City Department of Correction. Authorities said McGann walked into LaGuardia's central terminal on Saturday morning with what was determined to be a fake bomb. The terminal was shut down, then evacuated, but it reopened after several hours. "The defendant is clearly a very troubled young man," Brown said. "As a result, the court has directed that he be examined to determine whether he has the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his defense." McGann allegedly arrived at a checkpoint in the terminal at about 4:50 a.m. ET Saturday, carrying a backpack and refusing to answer security questions. Authorities said the officer at the checkpoint was informed that a suspicious package was attached to the bottom of McGann's backpack and that McGann allegedly grabbed what appeared to be a trigger device with a red button connected to the backpack. McGann allegedly pressed the button several times before an officer with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey grabbed the trigger and the package away from him. The package turned out to be a device consisting of batteries, cylinders and electronic components that could have been used to make a bomb, Brown said, but the bomb squad found that it didn't not contain any explosives. McGann had a ticket on a United Airlines flight to Chicago, Illinois, and a seat on two other connecting flights with his final destination, Oakland, California, according to a law enforcement official close to the investigation. McGann has three earlier arrests in the New York area, the source said. The most recent involved charges in June of tampering with evidence and resisting arrest. He also was arrested twice in 2008, the source said. Port Authority spokesman John Kelly said McGann was "just acting crazy." The arresting officers described McGann as "extremely disheveled and dirty" and in a "near catatonic state" and "staring off into space," Kelly said. McGann had been homeless for at least a year. Authorities evacuated the terminal after 5:20 a.m. but allowed passengers back in to all areas except Concourse C by midmorning, Kelly said. The concourse was reopened shortly before 11 a.m. Saturday, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Holly Baker. Authorities had stopped flights from taking off or landing at the airport, but flights resumed shortly after 9 a.m., Baker said. The incident disrupted travel plans for many passengers and caused American Airlines to cancel 16 flights, said an airline representative. American Eagle, Continental Airlines and Southwest also reported delays. CNN's Chuck Johnston, Aspen Steib, Ross Levitt, Laurie Segall, Kristen Hamill and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.
Liberia's president has declared a state of emergency after hordes of ravenous caterpillars infested the country. The African armyworm caterpillar is chewing its way through Liberia's food crops. Tens of millions of the worm-like larvae have appeared in the northern part of the country, where they are destroying green crops like cabbage and collard greens and contaminating the water supply, Liberian Information Minister Laurance Bropleh told CNN Wednesday from the capital of Monrovia. "I am not aware that they have been here before, ever, and certainly not in this great number," Bropleh told CNN. "That is why it was so overwhelming initially when we first discovered it." The state of emergency covers the three northern Liberian counties of Bong, Lofa, and Gbarpolu, Liberian officials said. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told legislators Monday that 350,000 people in 62 communities in those three counties may have been affected. There are also indications the bugs have spread to neighboring Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast, Bropleh said. "This is indeed a crisis," the president said Monday. Johnson Sirleaf said she appointed a task force, including members of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to identify the species and commence spraying. Investigators suspect the caterpillars are African armyworms, the FAO said. The infestation is "quite alarming," said Winfred Hammond, the FAO representative in Liberia. Hammond said the caterpillars started showing up sometime during the week of January 12 but spread quickly. In just a week, he said, the caterpillars had spread to 50 villages. The pests multiply rapidly and adult moths are able to fly long distances at night, the FAO said. Worsening the situation, the area's water supply has been contaminated by the huge volume of feces dropped by the caterpillars, the FAO said. "The plague is being described as Liberia's worst in 30 years," the FAO said. "The last African armyworm outbreak in the sub-region occurred in Ghana in 2006."
A fishing ship whose crew had to be rescued from a fire is limping to port in the United Kingdom, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency told CNN Wednesday. Ninety-eight crew members were rescued from the Athena early Wednesday, while 13 remain on board to keep the fire under control and pilot the ship to port, the agency's Claire Johns said. The container ship Vega -- which happened to be nearby when the Athena caught fire -- is accompanying the ship to Falmouth, England, where both ships are due Thursday night, she said. The rescued crew members are aboard the Vega. The rescue operation was complicated by Athena's distance from land -- some 230 miles (370 kilometers) southwest of the British Isles of Scilly and 270 miles (435 kilometers) west of the Pointe Du Penmarche in Brittany, France. Because they can carry only so much fuel, British Royal Navy helicopters only had about 20 minutes over the rescue scene before having to return, according to the agency. A plane was also scrambled from France to help with communications during the rescue, the Coastguard said. The company that owns the ship does not know the cause of the fire yet, a representative said. "Hopefully tomorrow when the firefighters come on board (it) will be completely extinguished and cleared and then we will know more about what happened," Sue Philbrow told CNN by e-mail from the Faroe Islands, where the ship is registered. Five ships responded to the emergency call to pick up crewmembers, who include Chinese, Russian, Peruvian and Scandinavian personnel, among others. The Athena is a fishing ship that processes fish on board. CNN's Eileen Hsieh and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report
or is expected to fall -- Friday, on top of the several feet that socked some places a few days ago. Wait, that's not all. After receiving up to 6 more inches of snow, bitter cold wind chills and strong winds into Saturday morning, the Boston area could see another snowstorm Sunday night into Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Granted, none of it will compare with the blizzard that blew through New England from Monday through Wednesday. Few communities were spared, with some getting buried under about 3 feet of snow. Others, such as the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, got hit by especially severe winds that knocked out power. And there was Marshfield, Massachusetts, which had blizzard conditions -- meaning a whiteout with heavy snow and regular winds of 35 mph or more -- for 14 hours and powerful storm surges that crumbled a seawall and significantly damaged 11 homes. The latest weather event isn't a blizzard, but rather a "clipper" storm swooping down from western Canada to the east. It gets its name from clipper ships, sailing vessels known for their cutting speed, the weather service says. This time around, Maine is in the bull's-eye. Snow had already begun falling before dawn Friday in Portland, and it's expected to add up to as much as 10 inches by the time it's over Saturday afternoon. That is not a lot for winter in Maine. But it could be a problem, considering that crews were still rushing Friday morning to clear out some of the 27 or so inches that fell from the earlier storm. "Particularly after the storm we had Tuesday, which was a monster storm, the cleanup really takes a little bit longer. And to have this back-to-back storm, it just makes it much more difficult for us," Portland Mayor Michael Brennan told CNN. Some areas of Maine -- all of which is under a winter storm warning through Saturday -- will get hit even harder than Portland, with 2 more feet of snow possible in the northern part of the state. "Clean up, clear out and stay safe," the Maine Emergency Management Agency advised residents. Some of that system will affect areas farther south such as Massachusetts, where daytime high temperatures should peak around or just above the freezing mark. That will seem practically tropical compared with the temps once the sun goes down, when wind chills will fall below freezing and wind gusts could top 43 mph. It won't get much warmer anytime soon. The forecast for Boston doesn't have temps getting beyond the 20s through Thursday, at least. That's not beach weather, but it's not surprising either. Speaking for Mainers, Portland's mayor expressed confidence that people will get through this latest wave of winter just fine. "We really do have some practice at this," Brennan said. "And this is winter in ... New England." CNN's Sara Ganim reported from Portland, Maine.
Livestock producers suffering through one of the most severe droughts in decades will most likely have to wait until Congress returns from its August recess before getting any new federal disaster assistance. A Senate Democratic leadership aide tells CNN that the Senate is "unlikely" to take up an aid bill that the House plans to pass Thursday before lawmakers dash out of town for a five-week break. The aide said the Senate can't accept the House bill because there are too many differences between it and an-already approved Senate measure, both in terms of who is covered and how the cost of the aid is offset. The drought assistance was part of a broader five-year farm policy bill that got bogged down in the regional and partisan politics of the House, despite major efforts in recent weeks to pass it. But with mounting pressure from drought-stricken livestock producers, the House decided at the last minute to extend disaster aid just for them before leaving town. The House bill would help cover the cost of livestock loses and the high cost of feed because of the drought. With bipartisan support earlier this summer, the Senate passed its own five-year farm bill that includes disaster assistance for livestock farmers and ranchers. The Senate has pushed the House to pass its own bill so the two versions could be quickly reconciled and the disaster assistance could once again be available. Livestock producers are in a different predicament than other farmers because in the last five-year farm bill, the livestock portion was extended for only four years and has now expired. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, warned Tuesday that if the House wanted quick Senate action on that aid, it should pass the Senate's version of it. "I think that what the House should do is take the provisions we have in our bill that we sent to them, and if they want to do something about drought relief, send that to us," Reid said. But House Republicans decided Wednesday they would pass their own language and then leave it to the Senate. Republicans said Senate Democrats would suffer political consequences if they chose not to pass it.
It may have taken 260 years but the home of golf is finally preparing to allow women to join its ranks. The Royal & Ancient Club of St. Andrews, which was established in 1764 and serves as golf's governing body outside of the U.S. and Mexico, has faced growing criticism for its all-male policy. A ballot will be held in September, with 2,500 members expected to ratify the proposal. The R&A says it hopes the resolution will pass with the required two-thirds majority. "The club's committees are strongly in favor of the rule change and are asking members to support it," a spokesperson told CNN. Speaking to CNN in July last year, R&A chief executive Peter Dawson insisted the single-sex policy of clubs such as 2013 British Open host venue Muirfield -- and others -- was a historic hangover. He told reporters at Wednesday's announcement of the September vote: "It's something that has been expected; I'm not going to say overdue but I'm sure I'll be asked that question. "Early indications from the members are very positive indeed. We have been talking about this for quite a while and it's our governance role which has been the driving factor. "Society is changing, sport is changing, golf is changing and I think it's appropriate for a governing body to take this step." The Royal and Ancient Golf Club has traditionally been the guardian of the rules of the game since 1754, although since 2004 it devolved responsibility for the administration of the game and the British Open to the newly-formed R&A. Last year the R&A was criticized for choosing East Lothian's Muirfield, which has a male-only membership policy, to host Europe's only major -- and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond refused to attend the tournament. The move by the R&A brings it in line with Augusta National, which allowed female members to join the prestigious U.S. club for the first time in 80 years in 2012. Augusta, which hosts the Masters, faced years of protests with President Obama also adding pressure on the organization. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore became the first women to be admitted as members.
Senate Democrats on Wednesday blocked a Republican effort to repeal the health care law passed last year. The party-line vote, with all 47 Republicans in favor and 51 Democrats opposed, meant the procedural motion failed to get the necessary 60 votes to pass. Two Democrats didn't vote. While the Republican-controlled House of Representatives previously succeeded in passing a bill to repeal the health care overhaul on Jan. 19, the Senate defeat Wednesday means a total repeal of the measure by Congress is dead for now. The Senate vote involved a Democratic challenge to a Republican amendment that would repeal the health care law. Because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the health care reform law will lower the deficit, Democrats argued that repealing it would increase the deficit. The Democrats therefore invoked a point of order against the Republican amendment under budget rules that limit the ability of Congress to increase the deficit. That forced Republicans to try to waive the budget rules in this case, with the motion requiring 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to pass. The threshold proved out of reach for the Republicans, who hold 47 seats. Using the budget argument was a way for Democrats to say they voted for fiscal responsibility. Senator Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, said before the vote that supporting the Republican amendment would be "irresponsible" and "reckless." "The amendment will significantly worsen the deficit," Conrad said, noting that senators from both parties are calling for getting deficits and debt under control. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, the amendment's sponsor, responded that the public will understand that the vote was really against the repeal of health care reform. "Only in Washington could you argue with a straight face that starting a new trillion-dollar entitlement program" was a way to save money, McConnell said. While a repeal of the entire health care law won't move forward, Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting for the elimination of a rule, scheduled to take effect in 2012, that would require businesses to issue Form 1099s to any individual or corporation from which they buy more than $600 in goods or services in a year. Most liberals and conservatives view the rule as an unnecessary burden on private-sector employers. Wednesday's vote amounted to a push by Republicans to get Democratic opposition to a full repeal on the record in the form of votes against the amendment. Democrats concede the health care overhaul can be improved, but they oppose rolling back benefits for consumers. "We're not going to go back and fight the battles of the last two years," White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Wednesday. "We're not going to go backward. We're going to move forward." Overall, the Republicans oppose the increased government role in regulating health care, claiming it will impinge on individuals' right to choose care options. Democrats say the law will better control skyrocketing health care costs and expand coverage to millions of people currently lacking health insurance. The push for an outright repeal is one of several strategies currently being pursued by the GOP leadership in order to undermine support for the law. Senate Republicans also introduced legislation Tuesday that would allow states to opt out of key provisions of the new health care law. Specifically, the bill would allow state governments to opt out of the so-called "individual mandate" requiring everyone to obtain health care coverage by 2014 or face penalties. It would also allow states to ignore new mandates regarding employer-based coverage, insurance benefits and an expansion of Medicaid. The motion was introduced one day after a federal judge in Florida issued a sweeping ruling against the law, siding with 26 states that had challenged the measure and setting up a likely Supreme Court challenge in the months ahead. A federal judge in eastern Virginia has also found the health care law unconstitutional, while two other federal judges, one in western Virginia and one in Michigan, have ruled the opposite. Twelve other federal judges have dismissed challenges to the law, according to the White House. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Ted Barrett, Dana Bash and Tom Cohen contributed to this report
shortened thanks to testimony that put Amanda Knox on the crime scene. After he arrested them, the trial prosecutor proposed that the motive was a post-Halloween ritualistic sex game. But when authorities soon realized the DNA and fingerprints in the murder room belonged to neither Knox nor Sollecito, rather than reframing their case, the small town prosecutors and police in the glare of international media dug in their heels. In the latest proceeding, a new prosecutor abandoned the sex game motive but suggested Knox murdered Kercher after an altercation over Knox's poor hygiene and sloppy housekeeping. In other words, out with Satan and in with the dirty laundry. With no hard evidence and no credible motive, spectators around the world are right to wonder what's going on in these Italian courtrooms. Rudy Guede has never denied watching Meredith Kercher bleed to death, and he left a bloody handprint in the victim's blood on her wall. According to testimony from Italian forensic police, his DNA was inside the victim—although it was not clear whether there was a sexual assault. In his prison writings and in his testimony at his appeal, he talked of how difficult it was for him to get the image of the blood that flowed from Meredith out of his head. Did this garish confession shock the Perugian authorities and courthouse press corps into trying to ascertain just who and what this young man was? On the contrary, he apparently elicited mercy, and had his sentence cut in half. He may well be walking free before the Knox case is settled. In his first comments on the case, before he was captured, Guede was surreptitiously recorded by Perugia police in a Skype conversation with a friend, according to police wiretap transcripts in the trial record, saying that Knox had nothing to do with it. But as soon as he was connected with a defense lawyer, he started to change his story. It's a trope of the case that Knox (and Sollecito) had a P.R. machine, vast amounts of money and great legal defense, while Guede was legally under-served.  In fact, his attorney was one of the busiest criminal defense lawyers in Perugia, well-connected with the prosecution, with a career behind him handling hundreds if not thousands of local crimes, often involving drugs and violence. Prosecutors' reluctance to deeply investigate Guede is understandable; they don't want to know.  But Guede may be the most interesting character in the story. Born in Ivory Coast, brought to Italy at age 5, he is more Italian than most immigrants, but, like other immigrants, he is legally just a guest in the homogenous country, not a citizen, required to report to the authorities annually (which was why his fingerprints were on file in Perugia). In the months before the Kercher murder, Guede was broke and showing signs of mental illness, and was involved in three and possibly more home invasions, according to police reports, trial testimony and interviews with victims. His apparent modus operandi was to break into what he thought were empty houses and make himself at home. A few weeks before the Kercher murder, someone broke into a Perugia law office through a second floor window, according to trial testimony from the lawyer who practiced there, turned up the heat, rearranged small trinkets, drank an orange soda from the refrigerator and appeared to have slept on the couch before making off with a laptop. At a nursery school in Milan a week later, director Maria Antonietta Salvadori Del Prato, walked in on a Saturday and found Guede sitting at her desk, she told me in an interview. She called police. They found the stolen laptop and a knife in his pack. Del Prato suspected he might have gotten a key to the nursery school from one of her employees who frequented the Milan club scene. Del Prato told me she believed he spent a night on the children's cots and cooked a pot of pasta in the kitchen, then placed it in little bowls around the room. From that interview and many more, I pieced together a picture of a young man who seemed to be acting out some sort of fantasy of a home, a fantasy that perhaps abruptly cracked when Meredith Kercher came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him.  (Guede has maintained "whoever committed this terrible crime is still free.") I believe one reason for the lack of interest in this young man is that a man killing a woman is mundane and boring, compared with the more titillating image of women fighting and  killing each other. The other reason, sadly, is a kind of reverse racism. He's black, and innocent black men are far too often railroaded in white systems, Italian and American. To suggest that this young man might have been the lone killer has a taint of political incorrectness. Male violence against women is a major public health problem worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the end, in this case, it appears that the commonness of the crime is what the Italian prosecutors—and many others--refuse to accept, searching for something more interesting and unique, in an elaborate, headline-grabbing crackpot theory that, they unfortunately still cannot relinquish. Remove the racial aspect, forget national pride and whether you "like" Amanda Knox, and we can see that this simple tragedy is all too routine.
A California food processing plant is voluntarily recalling up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachio products that may have been contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. Salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one company that purchased the nuts. The nuts came from Setton Farms in Terra Bella, California, about 75 miles south of Fresno. They were largely distributed in 2,000-pound containers to food wholesalers who would then package them for resale or incorporate them as ingredients in other products, such as ice cream and trail mix. No illnesses have been linked to this case, said Dr. David Acheson, FDA's associate commissioner. But salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one of about three dozen companies that purchase pistachios from Setton Farms, he said. Kraft notified the FDA on March 24. Setton Farms did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Acheson emphasized that unlike the recent case of salmonella-tainted peanut butter, this recall was not prompted by an sickness outbreak, saying the decision was a "proactive" move. He said the FDA has received two recent complaints, from the East and West coasts, from people who say they became ill after eating pistachio products, but a link to Setton Farms has not been confirmed, he said. The FDA is advising consumers not to eat any pistachio products, but not to throw them out, either, because additional recalls are likely and having products that could be turned in would allow for easier tracing of contamination. The agency is setting up a Web site to update the public. Dr. Jeff Farrar, head of the California health department's food and drug division, said it's likely that the roasted pistachios will be found in a wide variety of products. He noted that Setton Farms is the second-largest pistachio processor in the nation. Raw pistachios are roasted to a temperature that should kill salmonella, Acheson said. Because the roasted products tested positive for salmonella suggest cross-contamination with raw products. Acheson added that the Setton Farms recall is related to the one announced Friday by Kroger, a grocery store chain with stores in 31 states. Kroger recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores because of possible salmonella contamination. Kroger, in a statement Friday, said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the product. In February, Kroger was among retailers that recalled peanut products tied to the Peanut Corporation of America, a Virginia-based company accused by the FDA of knowingly selling peanut butter and peanut paste that was contaminated with salmonella. PCA's peanut processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, is being investigated in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people and has been linked to eight deaths.
Saudi Arabia and Japan made stuttering starts to their bids to win a record fourth Asian Cup title on Sunday. The Saudis, beaten in the previous final four years ago by Iraq, suffered a shock 2-1 defeat by Syria in their opening game in Qatar. Japan, the 2004 champions, earlier needed a late equalizer to snatch a 1-1 draw with Jordan in Group B's first match. Syria have never made it to the quarterfinals in four previous attempts, the last being in 1996, but boosted their hopes of progressing thanks to two deflected goals from midfielder Abdulrazak Al Husein at Ahmed bin Ali Stadium in Al-Rayyan. Qatar welcomes half the world for 2011 Asian Cup He broke the deadlock seven minutes before halftime when his shot from outside the penalty area went in off the head of Abdullah Shuhail, but Syria's goalkeeper Mosab Balhous gifted Saudi an equalizer with half an hour to play. The captain let a tame header by substitute Taiseer Al Jassam slip past him and into the net, but Al Husein saved his blushes just two minutes later as he again pounced on a loose clearance and saw his shot take a significant diversion into the Saudi net. Syria's Romanian coach Tita Valeriu was delighted after having only recently taken control of the team. "I didn't expect to win but I expected us to play well," he said in quotes reported by the AFP news agency. "I had only a very short time to coach the team but we used a formation that worked very well. That was the key." The result puts more pressure on the Gulf nation's coach Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro, who was failed to guide the team to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. "We didn't deserve to lose, but we lost," he said. "We are disappointed with the result, but not the spirit. China defeat 10-man Kuwait Japan appointed Italian coach Alberto Zaccheroni after Takeshi Okada stood down in July, having taken the "Blue Samurai" into the second round of football's biggest tournament before losing on penalties to Paraguay. Zaccheroni led Japan to a historic 1-0 friendly win over South American superpowers Argentina in his first match in charge, but the former Inter, AC Milan and Juventus coach was disappointed by his team's efforts at Doha's Qatar SC Stadium. Jordan, playing at the tournament for just the second time, took the lead right on halftime when Hasan Abdel Fattah's shot deflected in off Maya Yoshida -- who made amends with a headed leveler two minutes into second-half injury-time. Hosts Qatar shocked in Asian Cup opener "I am not satisfied with the result, especially in the first half," Zaccheroni said. "We must accelerate the speed of our play. We failed to finish on chances. I expect other Asian teams will fight like Jordan. We must readjust ourselves with that in mind." The 16-team tournament continues on Monday, as Group C kicks off with outsiders India playing Asia's top-ranked team Australia and then two-time champions South Korea taking on Bahrain.
Tuesday, for the first time, Google Glass was made available to the general public. As part of the one-day-only offering, anyone in the U.S. could buy the $1,500 face-mounted computers and get a free pair of glass or sunglass frames. Google isn't sharing any sales numbers for the day, so it's difficult to divine how successful its first open-sales event has been. There were no reports of the Google Glass sales site crashing or customers being turned away. Google did say it had sold out of the white, or "cotton" color of Glass. As of Tuesday afternoon there were still red, blue, gray and black options available. "Wow, what a morning! We're happy to see so many new faces (and frames) in the Explorer Program," Google posted Tuesday to a Google+ page, announcing the unavailability of the Cotton model. The Explorer Program refers to early testers of the Glass connected eyewear, which is expected to become widely available by the end of the year. Early on Wednesday Google posted an update saying, "All spots in the Explorer Program have been claimed for now, but if you missed it this time, don't worry. We'll be trying new ways to expand the Explorer program in the future." A Google spokesperson later said in a statement, "While you can still access the site, Glass will be marked as sold out. We are leaving the site open so Explorers can still get any accessories they need." The $1,500 headset was only available online, so there were no lines of buyers outside Google buildings. There also didn't appear to be any organized protests of the sale, despite isolated assaults against Glass wearers in this city amid recent tensions between longtime residents and a recent influx of tech-industry staffers. Limited rollouts are a good way for Google to test the demand for its much hyped wearable product. Previously, the only people who could get Glass were developers or people who applied for the device through Google contests. (The Silicon Valley-based company is no stranger to creating hype for a new product. When it first rolled out Gmail 10 years ago, the service was invite only, making it seem exclusive.) There are practical reasons Google has drawn out the product's launch. Glass is technically still in beta and it has been made significantly more consumer friendly since its launch a year ago. Since then, the hardware has been updated and on-staff designers created a line of sleek glass frames that can hold prescription lenses. A day before opening up the online orders, Google announced the latest round of software updates for Glass, which will roll out later this week. The upgrade is expected to improve the device's battery life and make future software updates easier. There are minor tweaks related to photo sharing, submitting feedback to Google and voice commands. In response to dissatisfaction with the quality of video calls on Glass, Google has removed that feature until it can be improved. Ben Farrell has wanted to buy Glass for a while but didn't pull the trigger until today. The San Francisco-based developer wants to wear the device while walking and running to get back into the habit of working out. He's also interested in developing location-based games for Glass, inspired by augmented reality games like Ingress. "The annoying bit about designing games like this is having the user constantly looking down at their phone while trying to play the game in the real world," said Farrell. On Twitter, many of the people expressing excitement about their orders for Glass, appeared to work in the tech industry. But some were just regular folks who wanted to see the technology's potential firsthand. Samantha Hutchison, a restaurant, hotel, and institutional management student in Texas, wants to find uses for Glass for students and travelers. "I will be on the spring 2015 voyage of Semester at Sea and I hope to help develop the traveling apps to help capture my semester abroad," said Hutchison. (She's #teamshale.) Nate Gilbert, a Glass customer who works for a rival company, thinks that the current price point is way too high. But that wasn't going to stop him from ordering a pair. "I want to see how legit this is. What can it do," said Gilbert. "It seems like the future, but how close is it?" There's also no way to tell if enthusiasm for Glass has been subdued by recent attacks on people wearing Glass in public or backlash over privacy concerns. Some fans might have decided to save their money and wait until Google releases the next version of Glass, expected by the end of the year. The next version of Glass will likely sport a reduced price tag.
Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius will be served with an indictment in court next week following the completion of the investigation into the killing of his girlfriend, South African police said. Following his court appearance Monday, the case is likely to be postponed while the prosecution and defense agree on a trial date, police said in a statement. Pistorius has already been charged with premeditated murder over the February shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. August 19 -- when he appears in court -- would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his home. He says he mistook her for a home invader. The police investigation team "is convinced that the accused has a charge to answer," the police statement said. The athlete's family said in June that he would resume running using his blade-shaped prosthetic legs. Pistorius has started sprinting again for the sake of his emotional health, not for training to compete again, the family said. EXCLUSIVE: Oscar Pistorius heartbroken, uncle says
I think perhaps the oddest person I have ever known was a man by the name of Robert Hyland. But the truly odd thing is that we all seem to have turned into him. Hyland was the vice president and general manager of KMOX radio, the 50,000-watt powerhouse in St. Louis, Missouri. He came to work every day at 2:30. In the morning. That's right: Hyland would show up at his office at 2:30 a.m. each day. He would then work straight through until 5 p.m. He didn't do this once in a while; he did it each and every day. He didn't do it to set an example for his employees. He did it because he couldn't seem to stop working. "I'm not one of those people who need sleep to be refreshed," Hyland told me once. "I'll go to bed between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., and I'll wake up at 1:30 a.m. I have an alarm clock, but I never set it. I wake up automatically. I shower and shave, and I'm at the office by 2:30." I asked him if this schedule made any sense at all. "It's a good time to get a lot of work done," he told me. "The phone isn't ringing, and there are no distractions. I have a pile of paperwork on my desk, and I go through it." At 9 a.m., he said -- after he had been at work for 6½ hours -- the other people at the office would show up. And he would keep going. Hyland may have seemed eccentric -- he readily understood that perception; he said to me: "I think what you're thinking is that you're talking to a nut" -- but if he had lived a little longer (he died of cancer in 1992 at the age of 71), he would have witnessed something that might have astonished even him: The rest of the world joined him in his obsession. Hyland died just before the era in which everyone began using cell phones and staring at home computer screens. Society might never have been ready to do what he did -- come to the office in the middle of the night and routinely work 14½ hour days -- had the technology revolution not come along. But come along it did -- and with it came the erasure of all the boundaries that at one time separated the workday from leisure time. E-mails and text messages and BlackBerrys and all their digital cousins may have given us the illusion of freedom -- we tell ourselves that we are unfettered by traditional offices, that we can go anywhere we please -- yet in the end they have created a nation of Robert Hylands. We're never off the clock; that cell phone may ring at dinnertime, that allegedly urgent e-mail may arrive at 11 p.m., that instant message from the regional manager may pop onto the screen when we're on vacation with our families. And what do we do? If your answer is, "We ignore them," good for you. But the truth is, mostly we don't ignore them -- mostly we snap to attention. Ask yourself this: What do you think would happen to an employee who received an e-mail at home from his boss at 8 o'clock on a Tuesday night, and who responded to the e-mail by writing back: "I'm sorry, but I'm only available for work-related e-mails during office hours. If you'd like to communicate with me about this matter, please feel free to do so tomorrow after 9 a.m." That might be the rational answer. But how many people -- especially in this economy, and in this job market -- do you think would dare to do that? And it's not just when we're working for our bosses -- it's when we're purportedly doing things for ourselves. Try to picture your father's or grandfather's reaction if in, say, 1958, he had been trying to make an airplane reservation and he had been told by the airline: "We'd like you to purchase a computer and set it up inside your house. You pay for it; you also pay for the electricity to run it. Now, we'd like you to buy a printing machine -- you pay for that, and you pay for the ink inside it, and you pay for the paper that feeds into it. Now, we'd like you to use the computer you've paid for to do the work of reservation agents, so we don't have to hire as many of them. Got it? Now, use that computer, make your own reservations, and print out your own ticket. On your own time." Had your dad or granddad been told that, half a century ago, he might have thought he was having a nightmare. But we're grateful for it; we tell ourselves this is progress. If we log on at the moment the seat-selection process opens up, and we manage, by playing airline-roulette on our keyboard, to get ourselves an aisle seat, we feel triumphant. We barely stop to consider that we're working for the very airline company to which we're paying our money. Robert Hyland said he would feel funny not working all those hours -- he even did it on Saturdays; on the sixth workday of his week he would come in, as usual, at 2:30 a.m. "I just don't think that most people have the commitment to their jobs that I do," he told me. If only he had lived to see 2009. He would have been just a face in the crowd -- just another American to whom the notion of quitting time has lost all meaning.

Iraq's main political parties Sunday reached a deal designed to allow non-U.S. foreign troops to stay in the country past the end of the year, when a United Nations resolution authorizing their presence expires. Iraqi and British soldiers during an Iraqi army training session in Basra last week. The deal would set a deadline of July 31, 2009, for all non-U.S. foreign troops to withdraw, according to Abdul Hadi al-Hassani, a lawmaker with the main Shiite parliamentary bloc, who spoke to Iraqi state television on Sunday. The agreement awaits approval by Iraq's Parliament, which is expected to vote on the measure on Monday, several Iraqi lawmakers said. The emergency negotiations came after lawmakers Saturday rejected a similar proposal that would have been law. Sunday's proposal, by contrast, was drafted as a resolution that would empower the Cabinet to authorize international troop presence without requiring Parliament to pass a law. Washington and Baghdad have already worked out a separate agreement that will keep U.S. troops in Iraq but tighten restrictions on them. Countries other than the United States that have troops in Iraq could be left with no legal cover for their presence there if Baghdad does not act swiftly. Iraq's Cabinet had approved a draft law authorizing non-U.S. foreign troops Tuesday, the first step in passing legislation, but it fell at the next hurdle -- Parliament. That left lawmakers scrambling Sunday for a way to give foreign troops legal cover quickly. Lawmakers expect Sunday's agreement to cut through the problem, because a resolution can be passed in a single day, while it takes at least a week to pass a law. British government lawyers, meanwhile, are studying "all possible options" to legally extend the presence of British troops in Iraq beyond New Year's Day in case Iraq's Parliament rejects the new compromise. Britain has the second-largest contingent of foreign troops in Iraq -- about 4,100 -- after the United States, which has about 142,500. All other countries combined have only several hundred troops in the country. Britain and Iraq announced last week that British troops would begin leaving Iraq in May 2009, while a "handful" of British military personnel would remain after that date to continue naval training for Iraqi sailors, primarily to protect oil platforms. The United States reached a security agreement with Iraq in November. That deal, which was ratified by the Iraqi Parliament, calls for American troops to leave Iraqi cities by June 2009, and to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. Beginning New Year's Day, U.S. commanders will have to get prior Iraqi government approval for any operations. American military personnel who commit crimes while not on duty or who commit grave crimes while on duty would be subject to Iraqi legal jurisdiction under the new agreement. The U.S. security agreement does not govern the presence of troops from other coalition countries. The Parliament's rejection of the Cabinet's proposed law allowing foreign forces to remain in Iraq after January 1 came after heated arguments that lasted for days. The session became so contentious that Parliament's speaker threatened to resign, lawmakers said. Some political blocs, notably the Sadrists, oppose any extension of the presence of foreign troops in Iraq. That group, headed by Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr -- an anti-Western cleric -- is demanding an immediate withdrawal of foreign forces. CNN's Jill Dougherty and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.
Defeat could be near for Syria's embattled regime, NATO and Syrian ally Russia said Thursday. "I think now it's only a question of time," NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels, Belgium, where he and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the deployment of two Patriot air-defense batteries to Turkey's border with Syria. The al-Assad government is "approaching collapse," Rasmussen said. "I urge the regime to stop violence, to realize what is the actual situation and initiate a process that leads to the accommodation of the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people." Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov offered a similar view from Moscow, noting what he said were rebel reports that victory was imminent. "We need to look the facts in the eye," the state-run RIA Novosti news service quoted Bogdanov as saying. "Unfortunately, we can't exclude a victory by the opposition." His comments came as opposition groups said they had seized a military base near Damascus and amid calls by the Local Coordination Committees for rebels to push for the fall of the capital. "We all know that the battle is not going to be easy and that the regime will defend its existence by the most brutal means, as we have become accustomed to seeing," the opposition group said. "We know that the regime will spare no resources in destroying any hold it may have before its collapse, as we have witnessed in all other Syrian cities." Diplomatic efforts to help end the 21-month conflict, which opposition activists say has claimed more than 42,000 lives, have so far failed. A rebel victory would unleash a host of complications for the shattered country, including the need to quickly assemble a functioning government; to provide humanitarian assistance as winter approaches; and to address the status of the chemical weapons currently held by regime forces. U.S. official: Syria uses Scud missiles against rebels The regime has shown no signs of backing down. On Thursday, the LCC reported that 138 people had been killed by government forces, including seven children and four women. Sixty-nine of the deaths occurred in Damascus and its suburbs, it said. Syrian state TV, citing a foreign ministry official, denied Thursday Western accusations that the government has used Scud missiles against rebels inside the country, a move analysts and world leaders have described as a dangerous escalation in President Bashar al-Assad's campaign against the rebellion. A U.S. official said Syrian forces in Damascus loyal to al-Assad had fired at least four short-range Scud missiles from the capital into northern Syria, presumably at rebel groups. Rasmussen said NATO also had detected launches this week. "We can't confirm details of the missiles, but some of the information indicates they were Scud-type missiles," Rasmussen said. "The use of such indiscriminate weapons shows utter disregard for the lives of the Syrian people. It is reckless, and I strongly condemn it." Aleppo Today TV becomes vital news source amid Syria's chaos The predictions of defeat for al-Assad and his forces come amid rising international recognition of the Syrian opposition. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama extended U.S. recognition to the rebel coalition. The more than 100 nations in the Friends of Syria group followed suit on Wednesday and pledged at least $110 million in humanitarian aid. Coalition Vice President George Sabra said rebels were pleased with the gestures, but had hoped the United States would go further by naming the group not just as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people but as their sole legitimate representative. Syrian officials belittled the declarations. Information Minister Omran al-Zoebi said the recognition was comparable to Syria recognizing "Liverpool Football Club as the sole representative of the British people while in fact it represented very little," Britain's Independent newspaper said. As fighting subsides, Aleppo residents find little left Also Thursday, Amnesty International urged rebel leaders to free a Ukrainian journalist accused of working with Syrian government officials and to respect international accords on human rights. "There are increasing reports of opposition forces carrying out horrific abuses of captured government soldiers, journalists and some other civilians," Amnesty said Thursday. "The coalition must condemn these grave abuses in the strongest possible terms and do its utmost to prevent them." The LCC called on rebels to deliver a knockout punch to the regime while protecting civilians, religious sites and the nation's cultural heritage. It also urged rebels to preserve any documents found in offices of state security services seized by rebels in preparation for possible war crimes trials. "These documents contain massive amounts of incriminating evidence against the regime and its symbols and will be required to hold the regime accountable, compensate victims and retain a historical record of decades of state behavior," the group said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said U.S. government-trained medical workers have reached an estimated 410,000 patients in Syria, performed 22,370 surgeries and had partnered with a group -- which she would not identify for security reasons -- that has set up 20 field hospitals in the country. "I don't think any of us has a crystal ball as to exactly how this is going to go, but we do believe that the Assad regime's days are numbered," Nuland said. "The opposition in recent days and weeks has made a number of significant captures, in particular major military facility outside of Aleppo with the last Sheik Suleiman base and other important military installations." She urged Russian officials to withdraw support for the al-Assad regime.

Second, the company must clearly communicate what it is doing to fix the problem and prevent anything like it from ever happening again. How did an engine fire, serious as that might be, so quickly develop into a disaster of this magnitude? My celebration trip on the Carnival Triumph: From joy to misery How could it have been allowed to happen? Why was the widely reported chaos and disorder allowed to develop? Why did Carnival not have emergency response plans in place? What is the industry doing to prepare for what would seem to be a manageable situation? The public will demand answers to these basic questions before it will begin to trust again. Uncertainty breathes life into a crisis. Accurate and timely information smothers it. Third, Carnival must aggressively and clearly deliver these messages now, and for as long as it takes to restore the public's trust. So far, the story has been about the unthinkable conditions the passengers have been forced to endure. Carnival must move aggressively to reshape that narrative to reflect all that it is doing to rectify the situation. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? Carnival has to resist the temptation to explain, minimize, or justify what happened and position itself instead as part of the solution to the problems that caused the disaster. That is what the public will focus on and remember, but only if Carnival is able to communicate it fast and effectively.
The ex-madam and political candidate who claimed she supplied former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer with escorts pleaded guilty Friday to pushing prescription drugs, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Kristin Davis, 38, who ran against Spitzer for the office of comptroller, admitted in Manhattan federal court to one count of "distributing and possessing with intent to distribute controlled substances, specifically alprazolam, zolpidem and carisoprodol," Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. Bharara said Davis illegally sold "hundreds of highly-addictive and dangerous prescription pills" and helped fuel "the fastest-growing drug problem in the country" and a "public health epidemic." Davis faces up to 5 years in prison when she is sentenced July 25. Under the plea agreement, she also agreed to forfeit $1,765. Her lawyer, Daniel Hochheiser, told CNN that he plans to ask for leniency. "I'm hoping that she can remain at liberty so that she can pursue her new career and complete her current studies," he said. "She's going to school ... but at this point I just want to protect her privacy. It's more career-oriented ... to put herself in a position to gain new skills so she pursue a new career once this case is wrapped up." Davis was arrested on the drug charges last August when she was running an unsuccessful campaign for comptroller against Spitzer. The former governor has denied using the services of the ex-madam. Based on a tip from an FBI witness, agents set up a sting operation from January through March of 2013 and caught her pushing pills on three separate occasions to the witness, who she believed to be a drug dealer, prosecutors said. Davis became synonymous with the prostitution scandal involving Spitzer, then serving as governor. She never provided proof that she  arranged escorts for Spitzer, but she did spend four months behind bars for running an escort firm. Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned in 2008. The former governor has denied using the services of the ex-madam. A former hedge fund senior vice president, Davis ran as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City. Has the road to redemption gotten shorter?
a lot of things for a diver to get snagged on, for its umbilical to get caught up on, to get disoriented," said Gargiulo, who says he's helped in the aftermath of recent catastrophes, including the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Highlighting the complexity of the challenge, Moeldoko said Monday that one large piece of wreckage initially believed to be part of the aircraft turned out to actually be from a ship. Objects obscured by waves The ships and aircraft looking for remains from Flight QZ8501 have so far detected several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the commercial jet, according to Indonesian officials. But they still haven't located the main body of the plane and the all-important flight recorders. Some of the bodies found over the weekend were still wearing seat-belts, search officials said. The bad weather conditions brought about by Indonesia's monsoon -- including strong winds, thick clouds, heavy rain and big waves -- have hindered the teams' efforts during nine days of searching. • Hayati Lutfiah Hamid • Grayson Herbert Linaksita • Kevin Alexander Soetjipto • The Meiji Thejakusuma • Hendra Gunawan Syawal • Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi • Jie Stevie Gunawan • Juanita Limantara • Wismoyo Ari Prambudi • Tony Linaksita • Shiane Josal • Lim Yan Koen • Yongki Jou • Indra Yulianto • Hindarto Halim • Jou Brian Youvito "As soon as you see something in the distance, it disappears behind a wave -- and then it's very difficult to try and spot it again," said CNN's Paula Hancocks, who spent 15 hours out on a search vessel Sunday. Flight QZ8501 went down over the Java Sea on December 28 with 162 people on board. It lost contact with air traffic controllers during a scheduled flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. The cause of the disaster is still under investigation. How can a modern airliner vanish? Initial compensation offers So far, searchers have recovered 37 bodies and identified 19 of them. Families who'd been holding out hope are coming to terms with a devastating reality. "I am very sad," The Ie Hua Thejakusuma said Monday as she sat near a candlelit altar in front of a pair of coffins -- two of seven of her family members who were aboard the flight. Five of them are still missing. "Even up until now," she said, "I can't accept it." Details emerged over the weekend of initial compensation packages from AirAsia to the families of the victims. Many family members have been waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones in Surabaya, where officials have set up a crisis center to keep them updated as bodies are gradually recovered from the waves and identified on land. Several relatives told CNN on Sunday that families of those on board the plane were presented with a draft letter from AirAsia outlining details of preliminary compensation of about $24,000 for each family member who was on the plane. While some families signed the letters, others requested revisions to the wording. This compensation money is for any "financial hardships" during this period of the search, and in the letters AirAsia stressed that it was not a confirmation that the people on the plane were deceased. Who was on the plane Search area extended Taking advantage of better weather, the surface search area was extended to the east, Bambang Sulistyo, head of the Indonesian Search and Rescue agency, told reporters Sunday. The surface search's extension was based on predictions that the remains of the victims, along with wreckage from the aircraft, have drifted with the current. The priority surface and underwater search areas remained the same, he added. Officials on Friday had said they were concentrating on a 1,575-square-nautical-mile zone that they believe is the most probable area to find the remains of the aircraft. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak Suspension of flight route AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, which operated Flight QZ8501, didn't have a license to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route on the day that the plane disappeared, authorities said. The airline was approved to fly the route four days a week but that did not include Sunday, Indonesia's Ministry of Transport said as it announced a full investigation and suspended AirAsia Indonesia flights between the two cities. AirAsia Indonesia has said it will cooperate fully with the investigation and would not be releasing any statement until the results were known, local media reported. But aviation authorities in Singapore said there was no issue on their end. The Singapore Civil Aviation Authority said it had given AirAsia permission to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route daily through March 28. It added that AirAsia was operating the flight four days a week, including Sundays, but that "airlines may adjust their flight frequencies in the course of a season in response to market demand or operational requirements."

Elton John may be famous for smash hits such as "Tiny Dancer" and scores for films such as "The Lion King," but he's also made a name for himself in HIV/AIDS activism. Advances in treatments for HIV/AIDS have led to some people taking more risks, Elton John says. The singer-songwriter established the Elton John AIDS Foundation in the United States and the United Kingdom to support HIV prevention programs, efforts to eliminate stigma and discrimination associated with the disease, and care and support services for people living with the condition. The foundation has raised more than $150 million. John has said that Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who died of HIV/AIDS in 1990, inspired him to create this foundation. John sat down with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta before speaking Tuesday at the Bio International Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Here is an edited transcript. CNN: What are you doing here today? Elton John: I'm doing a speech about the situation with AIDS in America basically, and how we need to address what's going on. We seem to be falling a little behind in America. I find this disease very cyclical. Every 10 years or so, after we spend a lot of money trying to educate people -- a new generation of people -- and we tell them to have safe sex and to abstain sometimes but have safe sex, wear condoms, we find that after 10 years another whole group of people come along. And we have to start all over again, which is really, really frustrating because it takes money for education. And we find that if we could get into the schools at a grass-roots levels, which we do in places like Africa where we get to kids at a young age and we tell them about preventive measures for not getting HIV, we find the success rate is tremendous.   Watch more of Dr. Gupta's interview with Elton John » CNN: Sometimes in medicine, you can actually be a victim of your own success. When the medications are pretty good, you see a resurgence of high-risk behavior. How do you affect that? John: I'm a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. I know that when I used to use and drink, that my mind situation was altered completely. Your caution goes out the window and you think, "Oh, well, we'll gamble, we'll have..." and luckily, I was so lucky enough to not be HIV infected. Once you have that drink and that drug, your mind-set goes out the window and a lot of people think, "Oh yeah, because there's medicine available now," as you say, "We're going to be OK, and we have to take now one pill a day maybe," which is incredible, because initially people had to take God knows how many pills a day, various cocktails to get them through this disease. Now, people are going back into the work force, they're becoming alive again, they live for a much longer time, which is great. But, this is incredibly toxic medicine you're taking, and it doesn't work for everybody, and you're really playing... Russian roulette with your life. And it's sad -- you think that after all this time, and all of this education that has gone down, and with all the statistics and deaths that people have seen, and the Ryan White situation going down, that people would be a little bit more careful. But we're finding they're not. CNN: When you look at your foundation, and you're talking to the people who work with you, how do you measure your success? John: We're very small, and I've kept it small because I've always wanted to keep an eye on what was going on. We have two people basically running the organization in America and about seven or eight in Britain plus volunteers. In America for the last four years, I've measured the success by the fact that we have a four-star rating from the Charity Navigator for the last four years, which means that we are doing a fantastic job. We don't waste any money, we don't gamble with our money. CNN: You go to South Africa every year, I understand? John: Every year at the beginning of the year, we start the year on safari, we go and visit our AIDS projects, and as soon as you go there and see -- and you have to visit your projects from time to time, wherever they are, whether it's in America, South America, West Indies, whatever -- we go and visit these projects on a regular basis to see the results that we're doing, to see if it's working, to see if our money's being spent the right way, and to come back and feel "yes, we're working, its working, so let's do more." When you see something that's working, you want to do more. You say, "This is fantastic." CNN: What are some of those success stories? John: Well, in Kalicha, in Cape Town, there was a woman we visited about five years ago. Somebody left a baby on her doorstep one night, and the mother had thrown herself in front of a train, the baby was orphaned, and they gave it to Rosalia. And she took it in, and then everyone started leaving babies on their doorstep. So there were about 120 kids sleeping in a shack, her home, like six to a bed. And we were reduced to tears -- one woman and volunteers were looking after all of these kids. We said, "One day, this whole street where you're living, we'll build you some homes, proper homes for these kids to live in." Now there are six "cluster homes," they call them, where they have running water, showers, proper bedrooms, they're like beautiful little houses. So that street now, there's no original shack left, it's got all beautiful houses for these kids to live in. You go there, you see how happy they are, and you think, God this is amazing. We were inspired because of this one woman. We do good work, but these people on the ground, these people that are actually in the trenches every day who are looking after AIDS patients, who are looking after orphans, they're the heroes -- we're not. We're just trying to make their lives a bit easier, and because they're doing such great humanitarian work. CNN: What is your routine like? John: Well lets put it like this: I have a musical nominated for 15 Tonys, I'm doing an animation movie for Disney that I'm writing the music for, I'm producing, we have a show called "Spectacle" which is on Sundance which is with Elvis Costello, which is an incredibly well-received show. I'm going to do an album with Leon Russell next year, I have a ballet going to be done by the Alberta Ballet, I have the AIDS foundation, I have my management company [in] which we manage lots of young artists, and I still have free time. I love my life and I'm 62, I've never felt better. I've never had more joy than I have in my life right now, and the AIDS foundation is a huge part of that.
London police have arrested a man in connection with a brazen daylight robbery of a jewelry store last week, they announced Wednesday. Security camera footage shows images of the men wanted by police. The 50-year-old man was arrested on Monday, police revealed. Some $65 million in merchandise was stolen in the August 6 robbery. On Tuesday police released surveillance camera photos of two men sought for questioning over the heist as well as  images of some of the rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches taken from Graff Jewellers on central London's New Bond Street. A total of 43 items were taken, with a value of about £40 million, or about $65 million, Scotland Yard said. The heist occurred August 6, when two men walked into the jewelry store at about 4:40 p.m. and threatened employees with handguns. As the robbers were leaving the store, they brought a female worker outside with them before leaving in a blue BMW, Scotland Yard said. A shot was fired outside the store, but no one was injured. The men abandoned the BMW nearby, firing a second shot into the ground, Scotland Yard said. Police believe they switched to a silver Mercedes, then later to a black vehicle, possibly a Ford or Volkswagen. "This was a well-planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape," Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace said in the statement. "These men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy London streets as they made their getaway.  Watch how robbers rip off London jewelers » "Someone knows who these men are," she said. "They would undoubtedly have spoken about (the robbery) before or boasted about it afterwards. I would urge anyone who recognizes them, knows the whereabouts of the jewelry or has any other information to contact us." The images show the two men dressed in suits and ties. One man is white, about 30, police said. The second is a black man believed to be in his 30s with short hair. Both men are thought to have spoken with London accents, Scotland Yard said. The robbery is the latest in a spate of daytime thefts at jewelry stores and designer shops in London's exclusive shopping areas of Bond Street, which includes New Bond Street. Groups of men or teenagers typically stage "smash and grab" robberies, in which they break the windows and steal anything they can get their hands on before speeding away in waiting cars or motorbikes. A CNN camera crew filming in March on Oxford Street, near Bond Street, caught a group of thieves speeding away on motorbikes from a jewelry store they had just robbed. The thieves choose to strike during the day when a store's security system is typically disarmed, even though the store and sidewalk may be crowded with people.
not related to command and control of nuclear weapons," the Air Force Global Strike Command said. The 341st Missile Wing operates about 150 of the 450 Minuteman III nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles in the U.S. force, according to an Air Force statement. A failed inspection does not mean that the safety of the nation's nuclear arsenal is at risk, global strike commander Lt. Gen. Jim Kowalski said in August. And in April, an Air Force commander stripped 17 of his officers in Minot, North Dakota, of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after they did poorly in an inspection. They were ordered to undergo 60 to 90 days of intensive refresher training on how to do their jobs.

England's Luke Donald beat new world number one Martin Kaymer by 3&2 to win the snow-hit WGC-Accenture Match Play in Arizona Sunday. Freezing overnight conditions and the unexpected snowfall struck the Dove Mountain course ahead of the 18-hole final, but once it begun it was Donald who warmed to his task from the start. He pulled three clear by the fifth, play briefly held up by a hailstorm which left the players sheltering for cover, and was never headed. But Germany's Kaymer hit back when Donald three-putted the short sixth and a birdie on the par-5 eighth saw the gap cut to just one hole. PGA champion Kaymer drew level as Donald made a hash of the ninth, finding the desert rough with his second,  but that was as close as he got to victory. Donald took the lead again with a birdie on the long 11th, extended it at the next as Kaymer bogeyed and went three-up with a further birdie on the 15th. He closed out the biggest victory of his career on the short 16th and the $1.4 million check. It was his third win on the PGA Tour, but first since 2006, taking him to a career-high number three in the new rankings Monday behind Kaymer and compatriot Lee Westwood. "It couldn't have gone any better -- not to get to the 18th hole in any match this week and pretty much go through reasonably stress-free," Donald told the official PGA Tour website. "I played solid this week. It's nice to get the victory." Donald had never trailed throughout his six matches and needed just 73 holes to reach the final, beating Tiger Woods' record of 77. Kaymer will console himself with taking over as No.1 from Westwood, but called Donald a "very tough opponent" as he could never get to grips with his Ryder Cup teammate in the cold conditions. In the all-American third place play-off, Matt Kuchar beat Bubba Watson 2&1 in a scrappy match.
Tiger Woods said Sunday that he is focused on "living a life of amends" after "living the life of a lie" in one of his first interviews since a November car crash outside his home unleashed a media frenzy amid rumors of extramarital affairs. The brief, five-minute interview on ESPN was one of two the professional golfer granted Sunday afternoon at the Isleworth golf club near his home outside Orlando, Florida. The Golf Channel simultaneously aired its similarly brief interview with Woods on Sunday night. Woods credited inpatient and outpatient therapy for helping him start the process toward making amends. "It was tough," he told ESPN's Tom Rinaldi of the therapy. "To look at yourself in a light that you never want to look at yourself, that's pretty brutal. ... I saw a person that I never thought I would ever become." Woods said two of his lowest points in the past four months came when he had to tell his wife, Elin Woods, and his mother about his affairs. "Those are the two people in my life who I'm closest to, and to say the things that I've done, truthfully to them, is ... honestly ... was ... very painful," he said. Woods told The Golf Channel's Kelly Tilghman that his mentor and father, the late Earl Woods, "would be very disappointed in me." "I wish I could have had his guidance through all of this," he told Tilghman. "Have him help straighten me up. I know he would have done it." Despite the open nature of the interviews -- both Rinaldi and Tilghman weren't restricted on the questions they could ask  -- the notoriously private Woods declined to go into detail about the night of the November car crash, telling Rinaldi that "it's all on the police report." "Beyond that, everything is between Elin and myself, and that's private," Woods said. He also declined to specify what treatment he has been seeking, but did say it will continue despite his announcement last week that he will return to golf at the Masters next month. "I'm excited to get back and play," he told Rinaldi. "I'm excited to get to see the guys again. ... I miss competing. But still, I still have a lot more treatment to do, and just because I'm playing, doesn't mean I'm gonna stop going to treatment." When asked about what reaction he expects from the fans, Woods said: "I don't know. I'm a little nervous about that to be honest with you. ... It would be nice to hear a couple claps here and there. But I also hope they clap for birdies, too." In closing her interview, Tilghman asked Woods about a bracelet he was wearing. "It's Buddhist," he said. "It's for protection and strength. And I certainly need that."
With a rev of his Harley-Davidson's engine and a smile, Dierks Bentley plays leader of the pack once a year on his annual fund-raiser, Miles and Music for Kids. On a Sunday afternoon each fall for the last eight years, Bentley has been at the head of the line as motorcycle enthusiasts follow him on an hour-long ride from the Harley dealership in Columbia, Tennessee, to downtown Nashville's Riverfront Park. The day ends with a star-studded concert, with some of the biggest names in country music joining Bentley on his mission. Over the last eight years Bentley, his famous friends and their fans have raised over $2 million for the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt. "The idea for this started, I guess, not long after I went out on the road. We were just trying to figure out a way to give back to the Nashville community, do something here. (We) get so many offers to do different types of events to give back, we kind of wanted to make our own so we could really focus on one particular thing," Bentley said. "We wanted to do something here in Nashville, so we chose the Vanderbilt children's hospital and Children's Miracle Network and kind of focused our efforts towards that. It's been great. From the very beginning we've made money, and I've been able to bring a big check over to the hospital every year. I felt really good about that." Bentley also credits the advice of a music icon in helping him focus his charitable efforts. "I sat next to Bono one time and heard about all his exploits and all the stuff he does with his organization ONE," he said. Bentley said he was overwhelmed at how much Bono's anti-poverty group was accomplishing, "but something he said, and I tell other people too, is to just concentrate on what's right in front of you. It could be a smallest thing in the world, just taking, helping out one person. You're making a difference in changing somebody's life, so just taking something you can tackle and get behind." While his primary focus was to give back in his own backyard, Bentley took his show on the road and held rides in several other cities including Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, and Phoenix to benefit the children's hospitals in those towns. "I really like the idea of that because so many towns and cities across this country have given me so much, have given me a life, it's nice to be able to go in and give back," Bentley said. Bentley brought the event back to Nashville a few years ago and said it's been pretty easy to get his famous pals to contribute their time on a Sunday afternoon they'd typically have off. Big stars like Luke Bryan, Jake Owen and Brett Eldredge bring the fans in, and as a result the fund-raising is more and more profitable every year. If you ask him about all the star-powered help he gets, Bentley just chalks it up to people helping each other out. But that's not entirely it, according to the event's emcee Storme Warren, host of Great American Country's "Headline Country." "I think it's as simple as his energy and his genuineness. There's just something about Dierks that you want to root for, and the whole town feels that. He's loved by everybody, both as an artist and as a person. So it's like he gets behind a cause, you want to help him out with it. And it's his ability to step out on the edge and say, 'All right, nobody else is doing this? Let's do it. Let's get it done!' and we all fall in line," Warren said. This year Bentley led 2,000 riders down the back roads of middle Tennessee, including a few famous faces. Even the fictitious mayor of Music City -- at least, he plays the mayor on ABC's "Nashville" -- Eric Close was along for the ride. "I'm here to support the ride that's supporting Children's Hospital," Close said. "One of the things I love about the city of Nashville -- it's an incredibly charitable place. There's constantly events going on, people are very supportive. It's constant that people are out there trying to make a difference, and this is one of those events where they're making a difference in the lives of kids through the children's hospital at Vanderbilt," said Close. Bentley, who didn't have children when he started this fund-raiser, now is the father of three and is even more aware of the importance of his cause. "You're always just praying to have a healthy kid, that's the most important thing, and knock on wood, we have. But you never know when you could be in someone else's shoes and need the assistance of the great medical staff and team, like at Vanderbilt children's hospital. So (the ride is) something I definitely look forward to every year and definitely feel really honored to just to kind of be the face of the whole deal," Bentley said. Miles and Music for Kids this year raised over $300 thousand -- a new record.
Egypt's new government on Sunday ordered banks closed for the next two days after protests by National Bank workers apparently drove out the head of the institution. The chairman of the National Bank of Egypt, Tarek Amer, told employees via e-mail that he submitted his resignation on Sunday, according to a person who received the message. "I was saddened because I could not enter the bank's building today due to hundreds of protesting employees," the e-mail said, according to a bank employee, who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. Amer was joined by two of his deputies and the bank's head of human resources, according to the message. It was not clear whether the resignations have been accepted. But Sunday evening, Egyptian state television announced that the country's lenders would be shut down until Wednesday. The announcement asked employees to consider the national interest in the wake of the revolt that drove longtime President Hosni Mubarak from office on Friday. The military council that took power from Mubarak has urged Egyptians to help bolster the country's economy, which had been paralyzed during the protests. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that the new government has made restoring security and reviving commerce its top priorities. "The Egyptian economy has suffered during this period of unrest, and was suffering from the global recession with a rising unemployment rate," Shoukry told CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS." Bank workers complained that members of Mubarak's family put their allies into positions of power at the bank with grossly inflated salaries. But the National Bank's headquarters in Cairo continued to function during Sunday's protests, with disgruntled staff taking turns to work and demonstrate. There were reports of protests at branches of the Bank of Alexandria and the Bank of Egypt as well. And hundreds of police officers launched demonstrations outside Interior Ministry headquarters on Sunday to demand higher wages, shorter hours, better benefits and more respect, participants told CNN. The protesters faced off with a cordon of Egyptian troops outside the ministry Sunday evening. They currently earn 500 Egyptian pounds (about $85) a month -- a quarter of what army troops of comparable rank earn, they said. They, too, want to earn 2,000 pounds a month, police protesters Mahmoud Tawfiq and Mahmoud Bedwai said. They also want their hours reduced and to be paid for working overtime, saying they work 12 to 15 hour days and face imprisonment if they refuse to work past the end of their shifts. And they called for free transportation to their job sites and housing once they get there, saying some travel hundreds of miles from Cairo for work at their own expense. Both low-ranking police officers and administrative staff joined in the protest. CNN's Amir Ahmed and Arwa Damon and Journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report.
When black people protest against police violence in Ferguson, Missouri, they're thought of as a "mob." But when white people got up in arms at the Pumpkin Festival in Keene, New Hampshire, a few weeks ago -- for apparently no reason whatsoever -- they were merely accused of "disruptive behavior." The two situations -- protests in Ferguson and drunken violence in Keene -- are not equivalent. However, it's revealing how the two groups are perceived differently by society and and the media. How is it that the bad behavior of some black people is used to condemn an entire community, while the bad behavior of some white kids is excused and explained away? Maybe this is why residents of Ferguson protested in the first place. A grand jury will decide any day now whether to indict a police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, this past August. In anticipation of possible violence, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has preemptively declared a state of emergency. It will last for 30 days unless Nixon extends it. Nixon is taking the precaution in light of the mass protests this summer over how the investigation into the shooting was being handled. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were some looters and other troublemakers. The police were widely criticized for their over-the-top militaristic response, including riot cops in tanks with automatic rifles pointed at the protesters. Complete coverage: Ferguson shooting and protests Police aggression made the protests worse. Slate's Jamelle Bouie, who was on the scene, tweeted, "This has been the consistent pattern. Unilateral police escalation prompts minor response from more volatile elements, justifying crackdown." Still, most protesters maintain an iron-clad commitment to nonviolence, which the New York Times noted in a detailed report. Yet, many on social media and some in the mainstream media continue to use the isolated actions of a small number of bad protesters to smear the entire community. The smears often carry a subtle, racially tinted message. "Stunning Photos From Violent Protests in Ferguson, Mo." read a headline on the conservative Daily Caller website, adding "Is This America?" "Ferguson Thugs Harass, Verbally Abuse Police Officers," read a headline on the conservative website RightScoop. "We know now that thugs are thugs," conservative radio host Laura Ingraham offered on Fox News. Now, let's turn to white protesters: In mid-October, during the annual Pumpkin Festival in the small New England town of Keene, New Hampshire, some white college kids apparently had too much to drink and turned violent. They were hurling broken glass and rocks at police (as well as, apparently, pumpkins). At least a dozen people were arrested and 30 injured, with 20 taken to area hospitals. The troublemakers seemed to revel in the chaos and damage they caused, with one telling a local newspaper, "It's just like a rush. You're revolting from the cops. It's a blast to do things that you're not supposed to do." "It demeans Ferguson and St. Louis to compare them to Pumpkin Fest," Professor Donna Murch of Rutgers University told CNN. Which is true -- and makes the contrast between how society perceives black and white behavior all the more striking. The protesters in Ferguson were airing legitimate grievances through mostly peaceful means and yet were denigrated, while the rioters in Keene were merely part of a party that "spun out of control" -- never mind that those in Keene were reportedly drunk and dangerous and disproportionately violent. The discrepancy is so jarring that none other than Twitchy, the notoriously lock-jawed right wing website, while managing to contort the incident to bash the supposedly liberal media, agreed, "Critics of the media do have a valid point. There probably are a lot of reasons for the difference in coverage, racial bias among them." Just days after the Pumpkin Fest, riots erupted in the largely white town of Morgantown, West Virginia. Why? Because West Virginia University's team beat Baylor at football. The rioters "lit fires, pushed over street lights and threw rocks, beer bottles and other items at police," reported the local news. Police and fire vehicles were damaged. Eight people were arrested. Were the riot police, the National Guard, or a state of emergency declared? No. the city is just considering a law to ban upholstered furniture from outdoor areas, since the "tradition" of setting fire to couches apparently fueled the protests. Could you imagine a news story about a black community with a "tradition" of burning couches? The media would be pointing out how they're "destroying their own community" and the right would make assertions about black people not deserving public assistance. And there's more. Earlier this year, students at the University of Minnesota rioted after their team lost the hockey championship. In 2013, Michigan State students rioted after their team won the Big Ten. The same year football fans at the State University of New York in Cortland rioted even before the game started. And in 2011, after the University of Connecticut won the national basketball championship, students rioted in the streets. These occurred in places with mostly white people. In these instance there were injuries, property damage and arrests. Why aren't we talking about the epidemic of sports-induced violence among white people? Why aren't we calling on state and federal agencies to crack down on their clearly destructive lifestyles? We don't yet know what the grand jury in Ferguson will decide and how the community will respond. But residents want a public trial with transparency and accountability. If the grand jury decides not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, protests can be expected. When that happens, let's think about the real pain that residents of Ferguson feel. And if there's any violence from a few angry demonstrators, let's keep things in perspective considering the marauding bands of rowdy white football fans and rioting Pumpkin kids.
George Washington's personal copy of the U.S. Constitution and a draft of the Bill of Rights sold Friday at Christie's for a whopping $9.8 million. Ann Bookout, regent of the board of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, won the bid. "This is our mission to bring home all things Washington," Bookout said. "We want people to know that Mount Vernon is the home of where these wonderful treasures should belong." The 1789 annotated volume, titled "Acts of Congress," will be displayed in the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington, which opens in 2013 at Mount Vernon. The near-pristine artifacts were printed and bound for Washington in his first year in office as president of the United States. "There's no question in my mind that this book is one of the most important pieces of Americana to come to the market in decades," said Chris Coover, senior specialist for books and manuscripts at Christie's. Washington's book has not been available since 1964. The item had a presale estimate of between $2 million and $3 million. However, it was the final auctioned item of the day and launched a heated bidding war between two seated participants, Bookout and an unknown bidder. "It was thrilling," Bookout said, "but I had a quiet resolve with the support of the ladies who are on the board that we were determined to bring it home." This copy of the Acts of Congress stayed in the library at Mount Vernon after Washington's death in 1799. In 1876, many of his books, including this volume, were auctioned off. Washington's notes and brackets line the margins of the Constitution. On the title page is his signature. On the marbled end paper is his personal bookplate, engraved with his motto, Exitus acta probat (the end justifies the means). "It has such resonance of Washington the man," Coover said. "It was sort of a way of reminding himself what the responsibilities and duties of the president were. You can't get more evocative than that."
Switzerland and the Czech Republic broke new ground in Davis Cup tennis on Saturday playing out the longest match in the tournament's history in Geneva. Lasting seven hours and two minutes, the doubles match between Swiss pair Stanislas Wawrinka and Marco Chiudinelli and Tomas Berdych and Lukas Rosol comfortably beat the previous record of six hours 20 minutes set in 1982 when John McEnroe beat Mats Wilander (9-7 6-2 15-17 3-6 8-6) in the tie between the United States and Sweden. The epic match eventually went the Czech pair's way 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-7(5-7) 24-22 to hand them a 2-1 lead heading into Sunday's reverse singles. Wawrinka, who toiled for five hours against Novak Djokovic in Melbourne two weeks ago, tweeted after the match: "Ice bath done! Now massage and food... Lets be ready for tomorrow!!!!???? ... And congrats to Berdich and Rosol!" The Swiss no.2 must win the first singles match against Berdych on Sunday to keep the tie alive. The U.S.'s tie with Brazil in Florida is also well poised after the Bryan brothers suffered a shock five-set defeat (6-7 7-6 4-6 6-3 3-6) to Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares on Saturday. John Isner will play Thomaz Bellucci in the first reverse singles match on Sunday. Should he win, the U.S. will play Serbia in the quarterfinals in April. The 2010 champions reached the last eight on Saturday when Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjic defeated Belgian pair Steve Darcis and Ruben Bemelmans in four sets 6-4 6-4 5-7 6-4. The victory followed wins for world no.1 Novak Djokovic and Troicki in Friday's singles matches. Surefooted Djokovic wins France are also safely through to the quarterfinals with a 3-0 win over Israel in Rouen. Michael Llodra and Julien Benneteau beat Israeli pairing Dudi Sela and Jonathan Erlich in straight sets 7-6 (7/3) 6-1 6-0 which followed singles' wins for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Richard Gasquet on Friday. The French, whose last Davis Cup triumph was in 2001 will now play Argentina after they whitewashed Germany in Buenos Aires -- David Nalbandian and Horacio Zeballos winning their doubles match against Christopher Kas and Tobias Kamke 6-1 6-4 5-7 6-2. In Vancouver, Spain -- runners up in 2012 -- are in danger of losing to Canada. The hosts are currently 2-0 up against a Spanish team without Rafael Nadal, David Ferrer, Nicolas Almagro and Fernando Verdasco. The ties between Italy and Croatia and Kazakhstan and Austria will be decided on Sunday. Italy hold the edge in their tie in Turin after Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini won their doubles match against Marin Cilic and Ivan Dodig on Saturday. Austra fought back against Kazakhstan in Astana on Saturday with Julian Knowle and Alexander Peya winning their doubles match against Andrey Golubev and Yuriy Schukin in straight sets 7-6 6-3 7-6.
After six days of protests that packed the state capitol, Wisconsin's major teachers' union called on members to start returning to work Monday but keep fighting a proposed rollback of union protections for public employees. "To educators whose contracts do not recognize Presidents' Day, we call on them to return to duty by day -- and find ways to be vocal and visible after their workday is done," Mary Bell, president of the nearly 100,000-member Wisconsin Education Association Council, told members in a statement issued Sunday afternoon. "To those whose contracts recognize Presidents' Day as a holiday, we call on them to return to Madison." But other unions said they plan to continue demonstrations into Tuesday, and not all members of Bell's union had decided to follow her lead. Members of Madison's WEAC local, the MTI Teachers Union, have voted to remain at the capitol on Monday at least, its president, Mike Lipp, told CNN. "I think every teacher in here wants to be back with their students, but we also understand that there are important points to be made," Madison high school teacher David Olson told CNN. "And so far, we've done a good job of using our collective action to force the issue and to make sure people understand why we're fighting. It's an important fight to continue." Wisconsin's new Republican governor, Scott Walker, is pushing a state budget bill that would severely curtail collective bargaining for public employees. Walker says the measures are needed to head off a $3.6 billion budget shortfall by 2013 that could result in thousands of layoffs. But the issue has triggered widespread resistance from unions, even those that won't be affected by the plan, and the 14 Democrats in the state Senate have fled Wisconsin to stall a vote on the plan. "It is not about specific negotiation points," Matthew Kearney, a member of the Teaching Assistants Association and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told CNN on Sunday. "It's about the existence of unions, the fact that this bill would make it impossible for public unions to exist in Wisconsin. That's what's it's designed to do, to destroy public unions." The demonstrations caused schools districts to cancel classes in Milwaukee and Madison for much of last week as large numbers of teachers took the day off work to protest. Some teachers have been given doctors' notes to excuse their absences from physicians sympathetic to their cause, protesters told CNN. And an estimated 55,000 people turned out for Saturday rallies at the capitol, mostly in opposition to Walker's plan. Several thousand more packed the building on Sunday, sending up a rousing cheer when a group of firefighters -- who, along with police, are exempt from Walker's proposed bill -- joined them in a show of support. Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Walker denied complaints that he was trying to break up public employee unions. But he said that collective bargaining has hindered local governments' efforts to manage their finances "time and time again." "The difference is, unlike those other states, I want to give those local governments the tools they need to balance the budget now and in the future," he said. "They can't do that with the current collective bargaining laws in the state." Walker called on the fugitive Democrats to come back home, telling them, "If you want to participate in a democracy, you've got to be in the arena." But the senators said they'll stay away unless Walker agrees to negotiations over his proposal, arguing that teachers have already agreed to pay more toward health care and pensions. "In return, they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed," state Senator Jon Erpenbach, a Democrat, said Saturday.

The Hollywood home of the Academy Awards show has a new name to replace the one it lost when Eastman Kodak Co. filed for bankruptcy in January. The former Kodak Theatre is now the Dolby Theatre, thanks to a 20-year naming rights contract with Dolby Laboratories, a company known for its movie sound systems. Along with getting its name mentioned frequently in the Oscars broadcasts and coverage leading up to the show, Dolby will use the theater as a "world class showcase for Dolby innovation," said Ramzi Haidamus, Dolby's sales and marketing executive vice president. The sponsorship deal includes a commitment by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to keep the annual Oscars ceremony in the 3,400-seat theater for another 20 years; it has been there since 2002. "The Academy's Board of Governors believes that the home for our awards is in Hollywood," Academy President Tom Sherak said. "It is where the Academy and the motion picture industry are rooted." There had been speculation that the Oscars could move to the newer Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. Dolby would not reveal how much it was paying for the naming rights, but Kodak reportedly paid $4 million a year in the deal, initiated when the theater opened in 2001. Dolby's contract is "very directly tied to the Oscars being held in this theatre," meaning the company could get out of the deal if the Academy moved its awards show before 2033, Haidamus said. The company is "working feverishly" to produce Dolby Theatre marquee signage, which should be up within weeks, he said. The theater is in a retail complex at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, one of the world's most-visited tourist spots.
The winner of the 2012 commencement sweepstakes is in.  It's Barnard College, which just announced that President Obama will be the featured speaker at its May 14 graduation ceremonies. The choice benefits both the president and Barnard, a 123-year-old women's college in New York City.  Barnard outdoes neighboring Columbia and every other Ivy League college when it comes to commencement prestige.  Obama, in turn, gets the perfect setting to talk about women's rights. The Republicans have made a national issue of limiting access to contraception, and Barnard provides the president with a forum to make his views on the subject clear. This comes at a time when the Guttmacher Institute reports that of the 43 million fertile American women who do not want to get pregnant, 89% are practicing birth control. In the Columbia Spectator college paper, the president's commencement address was the lead story Monday and a source of controversy and envy. Barnard students often take classes at Columbia, which actually confers the Barnard diplomas. Obama clearly trumps Columbia's commencement speaker, John R. MacArthur, the president and publisher of  Harper's Magazine. But Barnard's coup in securing the president, whose aides contacted Barnard last week, according to university President Debora L. Spar, raises an important question:  How do colleges choose their commencement speakers? At institutions that pride themselves on being democratic, the process all too rarely involves meaningful consultation.  Sometimes, students are asked whom they want for a speaker.  Occasionally, faculty members are solicited for their opinion.  But the asking around is most often window dressing. Usually, the commencement speaker is chosen by a college president or key administrator.   In Barnard's case, Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The New York Times, was the announced speaker.  But when Obama became available, Abramson was quickly dropped. As critics have noted, so much for a women's college worrying about favoring a powerful man over a woman! In an age when budgets are stretched thin, many colleges are still willing to pay thousands of dollars to get the most newsworthy person they can find to address their graduating seniors.  A famous commencement speaker is an expense that colleges believe will pay dividends down the line. Perhaps colleges are right?  Maybe the commencement game is worth playing to the hilt.  But I think it is equally possible that colleges are kidding themselves.   My alternative is that colleges should try choosing their commencement speakers according to the following rules: 1.      Ask the senior class whom it wants to hear at its graduation, and publish the results early in the fall. 2.      Make sure the seniors know who is available to speak. 3.      Require the commencement speaker to donate any lecture fees to the college scholarship fund and not profit from an invitation that should be considered an educational honor. 4.      Insist that the speakers talk no longer than 15 minutes and never use the phrase "real world." 5.      Strongly urge the speaker to recall what the world felt like when he or she was 22. These five rules should do the trick, but it is important to remember that there are always exceptions.  The wise college won't try to control every facet of commencement.  It will allow for surprises. The most important commencement address in modern American history occurred June 5, 1947, at Harvard, when Secretary of State and former Army Chief of Staff  George Marshall delivered the talk that became the basis for the Marshall Plan. Nobody anticipated how momentous Marshall's address would be. He spoke for just 12 minutes, and all he said to Harvard President James Conant in advance was that he intended "to make a few remarks in appreciation of the honor and perhaps a little more." My ideal commencement speaker for 2012, as I have told anyone who will listen, would be Little Richard, who turns 80 in December. Little Richard is, I believe, our greatest living rock 'n' roller, and one rendition of "Tutti Frutti" by him would make even the most humdrum commencement magical. But few of the students I teach would agree with me about Little Richard, and I am easy about bowing to their wishes.  Commencement is, it cannot be stressed enough, their day: It should be about who and what they think is important.
Herge's famous boy reporter certainly liked to stray from his native Belgium. Tintin's official profession may be that of a reporter, but he is just as much an explorer and archaeologist, dashing around the world to chase down ancient artifacts in addition to nefarious villains and a good story. Carrying on a venerable tradition of filmic archaeologists and adventurists such as Indiana Jones, the new Tintin film by Steven Spielberg, entitled "The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn," mixes the story-lines of several of Herge's books and follows Tintin and friends hunting for centuries-old treasure. "Herge was always interested in exotic locations and travel around the world," said Paris-based 'Tintinologist' and comic-book artist Jean-Marc Lofficier. "Keep in mind that he comes out of the tradition of (French author) Jules Verne, whose characters are always traveling around the world and finding lost civilizations and incredible ruins," he continued. Lofficier, who is co-author of the Pocket Essential guide to Tintin, spoke to CNN about his favorite historical escapades and archaeological "MacGuffins" from the classic series of comic books, beloved around the world by adults and children alike. 'The Cigars of the Pharaoh' Published in 1934, this is the first Tintin adventure to have featured an archaeological premise, Lofficier says, explaining that the storyline was "clearly influenced" by the discovery of the tomb of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun by Howard Carter in 1922. The plot begins with Tintin meeting an archaeologist looking for the lost tomb of a mysterious Pharaoh and is driven by the appearance of a number of cigars bearing mysterious -- seemingly ancient Egyptian -- symbols. Moving from Egypt to Arabia and on to India, Lofficier says the book is "a catalog of archaeological myths and popular clichÃ©s from the late 19th and early 20th centuries." 'The Broken Ear' This book, published in 1937, charts the hunt for a South American idol that is stolen from the Museum of Ethnography in Brussels. "It's kind of a fetish object, a small wooden idol with a broken ear," said Lofficier. "We find out that there is some kind of a precious stone hidden in the idol and everyone is fighting over it." "Herge is using the complications of having various people try to seize the idol as a pretext for a travelogue around South America," says Lofficier, explaining that Herge was as interested in anthropology as he was archaeology, with Tintin coming into contact with native South American tribesmen along the journey. 'Prisoners of the Sun' Published in 1949, "Prisoners of the Sun" is a sequel to "The Seven Crystal Balls," in which a group of explorers are struck down with an unexplained illness after discovering the tomb of a mummified Inca in Peru -- a storyline which echoes the supposed Tutankhamun "curse" that was much-discussed at the time. In "Prisoners of the Sun," Tintin and friends are charged with rescuing their friend Professor Calculus from native tribesmen, who are angry about what they see as the desecration of their culture and are eventually revealed to be last remaining descendants of the Incas. "At the end of the day, it is about the right of the Inca civilization to (protect their) culture," said Lofficier. "Herge presents the other side of the issue, which is that these civilizations deserve to be respected -- which considering the time period, is very forward-thinking." In the end, Tintin manages to secure the release of the kidnapped explorers and in exchange promises never to reveal the location of the remaining Incas. 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' Moving from ancient civilizations to pirates and buried treasure, "The Secret of the Unicorn" and "Red Rackham's Treasure" form the basis for the script of "The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn." Both chart Tintin and various other parties' attempts to unearth the lost loot of 17th century pirate, Red Rackham. "Half of (The Secret of the Unicorn) is actually a flash-back to the great days of the pirates," said Lofficier, explaining that Tintin's friend Captain Haddock is the ancestor of the sea captain who killed Rackham all those years ago. At the end of "Red Rackham's Treasure," after a voyage in a submarine resembling a shark, the treasure turns out to be hidden in Haddock's ancestral home. 'Flight 714' "Flight 714 is the penultimate Tintin book and has a very strange ending," explains Lofficier. The book, published in 1968, is strongly influenced by the science fiction of the time, said Lofficier, and features an incredible plot device in which the gods worshiped by the ancient peoples of a volcanic island Pulau-Pulau Bompa are revealed to have been extraterrestrials. "We are left with an ongoing mystery, (presented as) the ultimate answer to archaeology," said Lofficier.
If the "Old Lady" of Italian football needs a sharp reminder of where she wants to be, Wednesday's European Champions League clash should provide it. Any trip to the Bernabeu to face Real Madrid -- the nine-time champion of Europe -- is one to savor, even for a club of Juventus' stature. It will also reinforce president Andrea Agnelli's resolution that his rejuvenated side still has a long road to travel before its regeneration is complete. The Turin team's name in Latin means "age of youth" -- and this journey, for a club formed 115 years ago, is indeed still maturing. When Agnelli took charge in 2010, becoming the fourth member of his family to take the role, the Italian giant was still piecing itself together from the "Calciopoli" match-fixing scandal which saw it stripped of two Serie A titles and demoted to the second division in 2006. The 37-year-old has overseen a transformation of Juve's fortunes on and off the pitch, the club having moved to a new stadium at the start of a season in which it would claim its first title in nine years. Yet despite increasing revenue by 32.8% in the past financial year, the "Bianconeri" still made a loss of €15.9 million ($21.9 million). Real Madrid, on the other hand, posted revenue of €520.9 million ($715.8 million) -- 36.9% of which was profit. "Stadium and sponsorship, those are the two elements that we have to grow, to reach a point to become independent from Champions League revenues," Agnelli told CNN in an exclusive interview. "Then, once you get them, that is the extra fat you can work on. "At the moment, and this is the thing that worries me the most, we are still dependent on that (Champions League income) to make the numbers meet." Juventus made more money than any other club in last season's competition -- €65.3 million ($89.7 million) -- over €10 million more than eventual winner Bayern Munich. That figure owed largely to a domestic television deal that improved once fellow Italian club Udinese failed to negotiate its way through the playoff stages. The windfall underlines how vital a revenue stream it is for the club, and the precarious nature of an existence which relies on the luxurious flow of money from competing at Europe's top table. That fact is even more evident after last weekend's results. Despite leading 2-0 at Fiorentina on Sunday, Juve eventually fell to a 4-2 defeat, a result that leaves it five points behind leader AS Roma and vulnerable to attack from the likes of old rivals AC Milan and Inter -- both circling below. If Juve doesn't manage to make it a hat-trick of a successive Serie A titles, it must at least cling onto third spot to qualify for the Champions League playoffs. Should the club then make the lucrative group stages, that revenue will tide it over until the end of next season, when several key financial shackles will be lifted. "This year and the following we are going to struggle, but in 2015-16, that is when a number of important contracts expire and others can kick in," Agnelli explained. "That should put us in a position to become independent from European sports competition revenue. That will be very important for the club. "It means the year you might fail on sports results, it doesn't compromise the work in (other) years. "The only alternative you have if that is the case is to sell an asset you have grown internally, and we don't want to do that because we want to be competitive." A vital component of Juve's future is its new stadium. Its former Stadio delle Alpi home, built for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, was cavernous and crumbling. Stifling in terms of facilities and atmosphere, it had become a 69,000-capacity relic. The Juventus Stadium may be significantly smaller, with an all-seater capacity of 41,000, but it is regularly full and provides a far more intimate experience for spectators. Whereas the stands at the Stadio delle Alpi were an average of 70 meters away from the pitch, fans at its replacement are just seven meters from the action. And though the move has increased revenue, Agnelli claims Juve is being held back by a clutch of old stadiums that proliferate Serie A. "Our stadium has been very important but I think we've filled the gap with the European competition," Agnelli added. "At the moment it's very important from an environmental point of view because it really does give a different rush to the team. But we struggle in terms of pricing because all our competitors are in old stadiums. "The perfect benchmark for our stadium is Stamford Bridge -- 41,000 people both of them -- but Chelsea generate more than double we do in terms of pricing." According to Agnelli, Juventus Stadium is not only vital to renewing his club's future, but can also act as a lightning rod for Italian football. Whereas once it was the most desired place to play domestic football in Europe, now it has fallen behind England, Germany and Spain, with Portugal and France gaining ground all the time. "There are a lot of resources which can be gained from the stadium but we also suffer from the same show, which is being put up at our competitors' stadiums. They are obsolete and they price them completely differently," Agnelli explained. "You can debate that Juventus vs. AC Milan is the same as AC Milan vs. Juventus in terms of the show on the pitch but the theater is completely different -- they price it one way, we price it another. "That kind of becomes unacceptable for the spectator. Once all the others get new stadiums -- if and when -- that means you can raise the whole level of the show. "That for us is paramount because us alone, we are just a white flag, as interesting as we might be."
Five people were shot Friday outside a Chicago, Illinois, high school, police said. Police say a shooting outside a Chicago high school on Friday may be gang-related. Authorities said the shooting occurred about 8 p.m. CT outside Dunbar High School on Chicago's South Side. "It appears to be gang-related," Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis said at a news conference, adding that more than 200 officers were investigating the incident. "We anticipate solving this thing in the not too distant future," Weis said. Chicago Fire Department spokeswoman Eve Rodriguez said the five people -- all males -- were wounded by gunfire and taken to area hospitals. Two were in serious condition, one was in critical condition and two were in stable condition, she said. Rodriguez also said a female victim was injured in a fall and was listed in good condition at a hospital. Rodriguez told CNN affiliate WGN that all of the victims were "young people," but she could not say whether they were students. WGN reported that a basketball game was in double overtime at the school when shots were fired outside the building. Basketball games had been underway at the school for about four hours, and some students were leaving the building when gunfire broke out, WGN reported. Shaneisha Turman, 15, told WGN that she was standing in the doorway of the gym when she saw a silver truck pull up to a nearby bus stop. The occupants of the truck pretended to shoot, Turman said, and then "they really started shooting." People were shouting "They're shooting," Turman said, adding, "It was a lot of people shouting and running." Weis said security cameras at the school were being examined to aid in the investigation and while no arrests had been made, "We've got some positive leads."
Huang Guangyu, once China's richest man, was sentenced Tuesday to 14 years in prison, state media reported. Huang -- the head of Gome, one of China's leading retail chains -- was charged with stock-market manipulation, insider trading and bribery. The sentence, handed down Tuesday, also fines Huang 600 million yuan ($87.8 million) and confiscates property worth 200 million yuan ($29.2 million), said the Xinhua news agency. The 41-year-old Huang went on trial in late April. He emerged as a rags-to-riches entrepreneur in the late 1980s, when young Chinese pursued business ideas and turned them into multi-million dollar ventures. Born to a poor family in southern Guangdong province, he moved to Beijing in his late teens and, with a capital of 30,000 yuan ($4,391), set up with his brother a home appliances distribution company. He founded Gome Electrical Appliances Holding in 1987 and built it into a flourishing retail chain. Huang ranked first on Hurun's China Rich List, a local publication, in 2008 with an estimated fortune worth $6.3 billion. Such a top ranking is usually not celebrated in China because of the scrutiny it brings. Huang typically kept a low profile despite his wealth and influence. His meteoric rise has captured the popular imagination in and outside China. He also inspired many aspiring Chinese entrepreneurs. Police detained Huang in November 2008 for an investigation into suspected "economic crimes." Little was heard of him or of the investigation, but the police dragnet gradually grew wider, ensnaring government and police officials in charge of fighting financial crimes. Huang resigned from Gome's company board in January 2009. In February, after 15 months in custody, Huang was formally charged.
Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's new gig on Wall Street will line his pockets, to the tune of more than $1 million per year. And for those who played an instrumental role in his defeat in Virginia's primaries, the justification of their concerns about the former congressman is quite fulfilling. Kevin Broughton, communications director of the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, said, "many analysts accused Eric Cantor of paying more attention to Wall Street than to the people of Virginia's 7th District. He certainly didn't waste any time validating that theory." Cantor, who was the No. 2 Republican in the House, lost his primary this year to unknown college professor David Brat. Part of the reason was voters thought he was disconnected from his Richmond, Virginia, district by focusing instead on his duties as a fundraiser and national leader for the Republican Party. He left Congress early, resigning his seat last month. Since 1999, the seven-term congressman had raised more than $3 million from the investment industry. And in his last campaign, the industry was his largest contributor, donating $785,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. For disaffected conservatives, especially among the tea party, which came to life early in the Obama administration and took on a populist message, Cantor's move to a boutique investment bank, Moelis & Co., as a vice chairman and board member is proof that their concerns were spot on. In a statement, Cantor said, "When I considered options for the next chapter of my career, I knew I wanted to join a firm with a great entrepreneurial spirit that focused on its clients." Some took to Twitter to express their satisfaction: . CNNMoney's Charles Riley contributed to this report.
There is something deeply unsettling about this prickly, suspenseful first feature from writer director Sean Durkin. Although "Martha Marcy May Marlene" is set exclusively in bucolic surroundings, on a farm somewhere in the Catskills and in a luxurious lakeside cabin in Connecticut, the film is pregnant with dread. The threat of violence, implied or imagined, haunts its troubled, many-named heroine from the opening minutes, when she makes her bid for freedom. She wakes in the pre-dawn, picks her way out of a slumbering room, heads out the front door and into the trees. But she doesn't get far before someone raises the alarm for "Marcy May," and she breaks into a run. Later, after it seems she's free and clear, the same man catches up with her in at a diner in a nearby town. He sidles up and makes easy conversation. There is no coercion, no physical duress in this public place, but the menace is almost overpowering. And then he leaves. Has she been relinquished? Was she free to leave all along? Marcy May -- or Martha, as she calls herself when she phones for help -- does not believe it. And sensing her traumatized, near-catatonic panic, nor do we. But it's only gradually that we come to comprehend the reasons for her great distress. Durkin (who produced the chilly "Afterschool") does a very clever thing here. He cuts between Martha's painfully incremental rehabilitation and recovery at the home rented by her older half-sister and her architect husband (Sarah Paulson and Hugh Dancy), and flashbacks to Martha's induction to the commune from which we've already seen her escape. But the transitions are hard cuts, and often intentionally disorienting, so we're not always immediately sure what's past and present. It's a confusion we share with Martha, who is haunted by nightmares from the farm and acts out in ways that her family is hard-pressed to accept, let alone understand. Durkin gestures here towards a surrealist satire in the culture-clash between the bourgeois sister and the reprogrammed, defiantly anti-materialist, sexually uninhibited Martha -- though it's not clear his heart is really in it. The commune -- which initially seems idyllic and empowering -- gradually reveals its dark side, embodied both in the passive group-think of its members, and most disturbingly of all in the messianic Patrick (John Hawkes). His soft-spoken self-help platitudes are more Dr. Phil than Charles Manson, until he gets to cocking his pistol and teaching the girls how to shoot. Hawkes is equally convincing, whether he's serenading Marcy May on his guitar or blooding her in preparation for a nocturnal raid on the neighboring holiday cottages; a little ad hoc redistribution of wealth to supplement the farm's organic crop -- maybe the one sequence where Durkin, who has a talent for insinuation and withholding, oversteps the mark. But the movie stands or falls on Martha/Marcy May, and Durkin hit paydirt in casting Elizabeth Olsen. The younger sister to Mary Kate and Ashley, the 21-year-old Olsen is sensationally good, flipping between the innocent, impressionable beguilement of Marcy May (as Patrick rechristens her) and Martha's crippling, bed-wetting anxiety and anger. It's a punishing role but a star-making performance, a spellbinding portrait of a shattered young woman who has been systemically and cynically stripped of all autonomy, and who doesn't know if the pieces will ever fit back together again.
Troubled pop star Amy Winehouse spent the night in a London hospital after suffering a reaction to a medication she was taking at home Monday night, according to her spokeswoman. Amy Winehouse's husband was recently jailed for 27 months. Tracey Miller said she could not say what medication was involved. A statement from University College Hospital said Winehouse had been kept in overnight for observation. She had a comfortable night and was released Tuesday morning, the statement said. London Ambulance Service said it transported the singer after being notified of "an adult female taken unwell." Winehouse's spokesman in London, Chris Goodman, told the British Press Association that he had not been told what was wrong with the 24-year-old singer, who is well known for her song "Rehab," describing the singer's reluctance to enter a clinic. The pop singer was investigated this year after a London tabloid made public a leaked home video that showed her smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she was heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium. Police declined to file charges. The singer has battled drug addiction and spent about two weeks in a rehabilitation clinic in January. Winehouse won five Grammy awards this year -- three for "Rehab" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. Winehouse's Grammy winning album, "Back to Black," is still a big seller, recently charting at No. 12 in the UK more than 19 months after its release. Madame Toussaud's London wax museum recently unveiled a wax statue of Winehouse alongside Madonna, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and other musicians in the museum's "Music Zone" exhibit. On July 21, Winehouse's husband was jailed for 27 months. He admitted to brawling with a pub manager and then offering him $400,000 to not talk about the incident.
Here are some tips for keeping your plants healthy, plus suggested flowers and plants for container gardens. 1. Choose the pots Make certain there are one or more holes in the bottom of your container to allow water to flow out freely. Insufficient drainage can cause roots to drown, and the plant to die prematurely. Almost anything can be used as a container for plants, so what type of pot you choose depends upon your style preference and budget. If you prefer lightweight containers, which are easy to move around and can weather winter temperatures, look for resin, fiberglass, and plastic. Added bonus: These materials are not porous, so they absorb less moisture than unglazed clay or wood -- leaving more for the plant. 2. Choose the potting mix Do not use soil from the yard or garden. It can be filled with weed seeds, insects, and fungal diseases. Buy potting soil at your local garden center. It is a loose and light mixture of materials like peat moss, vermiculite, and, often, decomposed organic matter. If you are planting succulents or cacti, use a mix especially formulated for them. To reduce plant maintenance, buy potting mix containing a time-release fertilizer and moisture-retaining polymer crystals. If that type of mix is not available, buy a time-release fertilizer (such as Cockadoodle Doo) and a jar of water-retaining crystals (like Soil Moist) and follow the package directions for adding to the potting mix. 3. Choose the plants Make "Right plant, right place" your motto. You must take into consideration the conditions of your space. Don't try to grow a flower like a rose -- which requires six hours of full sun -- on a porch that gets only an hour in the early morning. Do your homework (read books and plant tags), ask for advice at the garden center, and determine which plants will thrive in the available sun or shade. When deciding what to buy, the simplest approach is to use one kind of plant per pot. If you choose to combine multiple types of plants, make sure they all like the same light and moisture conditions. Don't put a cactus and a pansy together in one pot and expect them to get along. 4. Prepare the pots If your containers are large, place them where they'll ultimately go before filling them. Once they are full and watered, they may be too heavy to move. Put a basket-type coffee filter or a shard of broken pot over the hole(s) in the bottom of the empty pot. This will prevent the potting mix from washing out but will still allow water to escape. Before pouring in the soil, check its moisture content. Read directions on the bag for wetting it properly. Generally, you need to add water a little at a time and knead the mixture with your hands. A good rule of thumb is to wet the mix until it feels like a damp sponge. Fill the container with the soil. Put in enough potting mix so the base of the plant (where the stem sprouts from the soil's surface) is about 1 inch from the top of the pot (to help visually estimate, position your plant while it's still in its nursery container). Before planting, pat down the soil lightly with your fingers to eliminate any big air pockets. Don't pack it down too hard. 5. Pot the plant Remove the plant from its nursery container. (It's a good practice to water plants in their original containers at least an hour before transplanting. This will ease their removal and diminish transplant shock.) Support the top of the "root ball" (the semisolid mass of soil and roots) by placing a finger on each side of the stem; then tip the pot and let the plant fall gently into your hand. Never pull a plant out by its stem. If it is stuck, tap the sides of the pot to loosen it. If the roots are circling around and around, the plant is "root-bound." Gently tease the ends of the roots free before planting. Set the plant on top of the mix. If you are potting more than one plant, leave at least an inch or so around each root ball so you can add mix in between them. Carefully fill in with small handfuls of soil. Pat gently to eliminate air pockets. Do not pile soil on top of the plant -- make sure the stem is completely above the surface. Leave about an inch between the soil surface and the rim of the pot. Water the container. This will settle the roots into their new home. If the soil level drops below the top of the root ball, add additional mix to bring it back up. Watering If you plant in the spring and the weather is mild, you can probably get away with watering about once a week. As the summer continues, plants need more water. Not only is the warm weather evaporating the moisture before the plant can use it, the plants need more water as they grow larger. Hanging plants and small pots may need watering twice a day (best times are morning and evening); once a day is enough for large pots. Water your plants until the water comes out of the drainage holes. That way you know the soil is getting moisture all the way to the bottom. Water the soil, not the leaves and flowers. Wetting the foliage can lead to fungal diseases and sometimes scorched spots on leaves. Don't worry if plants and flowers look wilted in the hottest time of the day. As long as the top of the soil is moist, you probably don't need to water. Wilting is a self-protective mechanism to prevent too much moisture loss from the root area. Wait and see if the plants perk up after the sun goes down. Don't let pots sit in water; this can cause root rot and death. If you are using saucers, empty them after you water and after it rains. Feeding Plants growing in containers need more fertilizing than those in the ground. The more you water, the more quickly you flush the nutrients out of the soil. It's good to use a time-release fertilizer when planting (see Step 2 on the previous page), but it's the bare minimum. If you want really healthy and happy plants, feed them a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer every couple of weeks according to package directions. Deadheading Pinching or cutting off faded blooms, known as deadheading, is essential. It encourages a plant to keep producing more flowers. Some plants have so many tiny flowers and stems, it would be too time-consuming to snip or pick off individual flower heads. For those types, it's best to shear the whole plant back to about one-third of its size. It will look "whacked" for about a week, but you will soon be rewarded with a flush of new buds and blooms. Some flowering plants are "self-cleaning," meaning they don't generally require deadheading or shearing. These are usually prolific bloomers covered in smallish flowers, which just shrivel up and almost disappear on their own. Some examples are impatiens, mini petunias, diascia, and browalia. If they start to flag late in the summer, cut back the plant by one-third to rejuvenate blooming.

Legendary professional football coach and ESPN analyst Mike Ditka is recovering from a stroke he suffered Friday, the sports network said. Ditka, 73, will not be on ESPN's football shows this weekend, the network said. But Ditka "wanted everyone to know he's OK," ESPN senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said via Twitter. "I feel good right now and it's not a big deal," Ditka told the Chicago Tribune. Ditka was playing cards at a country club when he found his hands "weren't working quite right." He then had problems speaking, the newspaper reported. ESPN says it expects the coach to return to broadcasts soon. Ditka is a Pro Football Hall of Famer and Super Bowl winning coach who has been with ESPN since 2004. He is only the second person to win the Super Bowl as a player, assistant coach and head coach, according to a biography by the speaker's bureau that represents him.
Actor Robert Pattinson dropped the f-bomb and singer Justin Timberlake grabbed the breasts of co-star Mila Kunis, who returned the favor by grabbing the pop singer's crotch. And so went the 2011 edition of the MTV Movie Awards, where the outrageous and often sophomoric antics of the ceremony's featured performers tend to grab, so to speak, more attention than the awards themselves. Between the gropes, the profanities and the off-color humor at Sunday night's 2011 version of the annual awards show, actors dispensed trophies to other actors. "Eclipse," the third installment in the teen vampire saga "Twilight," carried the night with five awards. That included honors for Best Picture as well as the Best Male and Female Performance awards, which went to co-stars Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. The movie also carried MTV's Best Fight and Best Kiss awards. Meanwhile the award for best villain went to Tom Felton for his seventh outing as the churlish, bad boy wizard Draco Malfoy in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." Ellen Page claimed the dubious Best Scared-As-(expletive) Performance prize for a supporting role in "Inception," and Emma Stone took top honors in the comedy category for her role in "Easy A." MTV gave actress Reese Witherspoon, who at 35 was likely the most senior award recipient of the bunch, a "Generation Award," in recognition of her career in movies. However, the moment was marred or immortalized -- depending on your point of view -- by an apparent failure of impulse-control by presenter Pattinson. Pattinson, who played Witherspoon's lover in "Water for Elephants," told the audience "I did (expletive) you," uttering a profanity broadcast over the air without a bleep. Pattinson didn't stop there. Moments later he quipped that that Witherspoon might be "33 percent lesbian." Witherspoon wasn't the only celebrity to get ribbed for her fictional or real-life romantic pursuits. Awards host Jason Sudeikis told the audience that actress and singer Selena Gomez had already swallowed three of boyfriend Justin Bieber's baby teeth while kissing the teen singing star. Bieber, by the way, won Best Jaw Dropping Moment Winner for his biopic movie, "Never Say Never." Other awards recipients included: Chloe Grace Moretz, who took the award for Best Breakout Star Winner for her performance as a vulgar child superhero in "Kick-Ass."
Google agreed Friday to delete data it inadvertently collected from unsecured Wi-Fi networks when compiling its Street View mapping service in Britain, authorities said. The British government and privacy advocates have long been concerned about the personal data Google may have collected when its Street View cars drove around the country taking pictures for the service, which shows panoramic photographic views from street level. Google admitted its vehicles inadvertently captured so-called payload data but said it contained only fragments of content, according to the Information Commissioner's Office, which examined the data in August. The ICO agreed it was "unlikely" that the data contained significant amounts of personal information but said it was wrong for Google to have collected and stored the information. It also said the collecting of the details violated the Data Protection Act. On Friday, Google agreed to delete that data as soon as possible, the company and the ICO said. "I am very pleased to have a firm commitment from Google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information," Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said. "We don't want another breach like the collection of payload data by Google Street View vehicles to occur again." In addition to agreeing to delete the data, Google signed a commitment to improve data handling, the ICO said. Google Senior Vice President Alan Eustace agreed that the company will improve training measures on security awareness and data protection issues for all employees, the ICO said. The company has also said it will require its engineers to maintain a privacy design document for every new project before it is launched. After the Google cars canvassed the country in 2008, initial privacy concerns were about license plates being shown in the photographs or people being shown in embarrassing situations, like entering adult bookstores. Google later admitted its systems had captured communications -- including possibly passwords and e-mails -- from people using open Wi-Fi networks as the cars drove past. The issue has come up in other countries as well. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigated the same problem but concluded last month that Google had sufficiently addressed it. The FTC said Google promised it had not and would not use the payload data -- though unlike the case in Britain, Google did not promise to delete the information. Also in October, the Canadian government said Google broke the law by collecting the data, but it closed an investigation after calling it "a careless error." In France, a commission that began investigating over the summer ruled that personal data had been collected. Authorities cracked down, even pulling over Street View vehicles to make sure they had stopped collecting personal information. The Czech Republic has banned Google from expanding the service, and the news sparked an online privacy debate in Germany, where Google is allowing people to opt out of Street View before the images go live. Graham, of the ICO, promised to keep a "close watch" on Google's progress and follow up with an extensive audit. "Meanwhile, I welcome the fact that the Wi-Fi payload data that should never have been collected in the first place can, at last, be deleted," he said.
Sitting on a simple chair, shirtless except for a bandage covering a part of his arm, the man seems relaxed. Almost cool, he smiles at one point and cracks a joke. "Go ahead, you can ask me questions if you want. It's strange. Normally, I'm the one asking questions. I'm the journalist," he says. "But it's OK." The video, broadcast Monday by the Venezuelan Telesur network, is the first to show images of French journalist Romeo Langlois since he was captured last month by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC. Statement: FARC to release Langlois Langlois, a war journalist with more than 10 years of experience in Colombia, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group opened fire, according to the government. Four people were killed and six were wounded in the April 28 attack. Over the weekend, FARC announced that it would release Langlois on Wednesday. The video shows him stating and spelling his name. He receives treatment for an arm wound and talks about his experience reporting on the conflict in Colombia. "I cover both sides, seeking the opinion of everyone," he says. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the video, which gave no indication as to when it was shot. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has said his government would do whatever was necessary to guarantee Langlois' release. "The Colombian government is willing to provide all the facilities so the release occurs as quickly as possible, but if you really want to be viewed well by the world, release him now and simply tell us where he is and we will go get him," he said this month. The rebel group has been at war with the government since the 1960s, making it Latin American's oldest insurgency. While severely weakened in recent years, FARC continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces.
who he said does not wish to be identified -- "connects the dots" about what happened that day when she lays out what she overheard while on the phone with him, he said. 911 calls paint picture of chaos Martin was fatally shot on February 26 while walking to the house of his father's fiancee in Sanford after a trip to a nearby convenience store.  Zimmerman has acknowledged shooting Martin. Speaking on the phone shortly before he was shot, Martin told the girl that someone was following him and that he was trying to get away, Crump said. The girl said that, during the phone call, she heard someone ask Martin what he was doing and heard Martin ask why the person was following him, Crump said. The girl then got the impression that there was an altercation in which the earpiece fell out of Martin's ear and the connection went dead, Crump said. Based on what she heard, the girl believes that Martin was pushed, said Crump, who added that the girl did not hear any gunfire. Phone records show Martin was on the phone with her much of the day, including around the time of the killing, Crump said.  He argued that if Martin were really "up to no good," he wouldn't have been chatting with his friend on the phone. The girl said Martin was "his regular self," Crump said, arguing that any suggestions that the boy was "high" are "preposterous." "It's what Zimmerman wants you to believe so he can justify killing this kid in cold blood," Crump said. Natalie Jackson, another attorney for the Martin family, said police had not interviewed the girl. Sanford Police Sgt. David Morgenstern said "at the onset, we asked any and all witnesses with information to come forward." He would not say say whether the department has contacted the girl. Morgenstern said Martin's cell phone was collected from the crime scene and investigators were working to acquire records associated with the phone's use. The girl provided her account to Crump in a recording, which he said he will share with the Department of Justice, which is investigating. Justice Department, FBI to investigate Florida teen's death Crump said the Martin family does not trust Sanford police to investigate. Federal prosecutors and the FBI will investigate the incident, which has sparked claims of racial profiling and widespread calls for charges to be filed against Zimmerman. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Florida, Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett and Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte met Tuesday with Justice Department officials: Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roy L. Austin Jr. "The gentlemen we spoke with -- they said they will not only look at what we've done, but they will also ... I think his exact comment was there will be no stone that won't be overturned," Triplett said. A grand jury will also help investigate the death of the unarmed African-American teenager. A police report describes Zimmerman as a white male; his family said he's a Spanish-speaking minority. The Seminole County Grand Jury will convene April 10, State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said in a statement. Gov. Rick Scott, who is asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to provide "any assistance necessary" to local investigators, insisted Tuesday he would work to ensure "justice prevails." The governor met Tuesday in Tallahassee with criminal defense lawyers and protesters who said his office should be more involved and form a task force on racial profiling. But Scott said any such task force shouldn't be formed until after a formal investigation. "There should not be racial profiling anywhere," he told the group. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was "devastated and deeply troubled" over the killing. "When someone loses his life at the hands of another, there cannot be any questions surrounding the circumstances of the death," she said in a statement. She said she had spoken with FDLE Commissioner Gerald M. Bailey, "and I know that a complete and thorough review of the facts will be conducted." She added that while it is up to the Seminole County State Attorney's Office to decide whether to file charges, "I will remain vigilant in ensuring that questions are answered." Police say they have not charged Zimmerman, 28, because they have no evidence to contradict his story that he shot in self-defense. In a police report, Officer Timothy Smith says that, when he arrived at the scene of the shooting, a black male was laying face down on the ground, his hands underneath his body.  "I attempted to get a response from the black male, but was met with negative results," the report says. After speaking with Zimmerman, who had called 911, Smith observed that Zimmerman's "back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass, as if he had been laying on his back on the ground.  Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and back of his head." Smith wrote that Zimmerman stated, "I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help me."  Martin's family insists it was Trayvon Martin who was heard yelling for help. Three witnesses who were nearby have said it was Martin who was heard screaming for help in the 911 call placed by Zimmerman, Crump said. Martin's father said the family believes race was a factor in their son's death, fueling public outcry over the incident in the racially mixed community 16 miles northeast of Orlando. "I think that's an issue that Mr. Zimmerman himself considers -- as someone suspicious -- a black kid with a hoodie on, jeans, tennis shoes," Tracy Martin, the teenager's father, told CNN. "Thousands of people wear that outfit every day, so what was so suspicious about Trayvon that Zimmerman felt as though he had to confront him?" Zimmerman's family has denied race played any role. Zimmerman has "many black family members and friends. He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever," his father, Robert Zimmerman, said in a statement to the Orlando Sentinel. The case was one of the most-discussed topics Tuesday morning on Twitter, much of it dedicated to an online petition posted by Trayvon's parents calling on Florida authorities to charge Zimmerman. As of Tuesday evening, more than 638,000 people had signed the petition at Change.org, making it one of the site's largest petition campaigns ever, spokeswoman Megan Lubin said. More than 10,000 people an hour were signing the petition early Tuesday. Demonstrators who have turned out in recent days to protest police handling of the case have mocked Zimmerman's claim, carrying bags of Skittles like the one Trayvon had bought shortly before his death. CNN has made numerous attempts to contact Zimmerman but has been unsuccessful. Zimmerman has moved out of his home after receiving death threats, his father said. Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws Florida's deadly force law, also called "stand your ground," allows people to meet "force with force" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant, but exactly what happened in the moments leading up to Trayvon's death remains unclear. In his statement last week, Zimmerman's father said his son never followed or confronted Trayvon. But on Monday, police released 911 recordings in which Zimmerman says he is, in fact, following the boy. "Something's wrong with him. Yep. He's coming to check me out," Zimmerman tells a police dispatcher. "He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Send officers over here." The teen started to run, Zimmerman reported. When he said he was following, the dispatcher told him, "We don't need you to do that." Minutes later, someone who lives near the scene of the shooting called 911 to report an altercation. In the background, someone can be heard screaming for help, but the caller said she was too afraid to go outside and see what was going on. "It's heart-wrenching, because those actually were my son's last words," said Trayvon's father. "And to hear his last words being cries of help, is devastating. It tears me apart as a father." The state attorney's office also said a voice analysis would be conducted on 911 calls from the night of the shooting to determine who was yelling for help. Opinion: My son could be Trayvon Florida Rep. Dennis Baxley, who was the prime House sponsor of the deadly force legislation, told CNN Tuesday that "nothing in 'stand your ground' authorizes (you) to pursue and confront." White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the FBI was monitoring the case but that the White House was not going to "wade into a local law enforcement matter." The Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have also called for a federal investigation, with the Black Caucus saying Sanford police showed "blatant disregard for justice."
President Obama signed sweeping health care reform legislation into law Tuesday, hailing the moment as the latest example of America facing up to major challenges for the benefit of all its people. The bill constitutes the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees in more than four decades, and its enactment was a giant victory for Obama and Democrats after a brutal legislative battle dating back to the start of his presidency. No Republicans supported the bill in either the House or Senate, and Democratic leaders needed a separate bill that calls for changes in the new law in order to get enough support in the House to pass the measure. The Senate started debate on the accompanying House bill later Tuesday, with Republican opponents promising to use every possible parliamentary tool or technique to undermine it. Obama and Democratic leaders celebrated the new law at the White House signing ceremony, with a crowd packing the East Room repeatedly standing to applaud and cheer the president. "It's been easy at times to doubt our ability to do such a big thing, such a complicated thing, to wonder if there are limits to what we as a people can still achieve," Obama said. "We are not a nation that scales back its aspirations," he continued. "We are not a nation that falls prey to doubt or mistrust. We don't fall prey to fear." Rather, "we are a nation that does what is hard, what is necessary, what is right," Obama said. In the end, he said, the bill delivered the "core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care." Among those on hand for the signing ceremony was Vicki Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who championed health care reform for decades before his death last year. Also present were several people who wrote Obama in the past year about their personal woes over losing or being unable to get health insurance. Obama had told their stories when campaigning for the health care bill in recent months. Among the private citizens attending Tuesday's ceremony were 11-year-old Marcelas Owens of Washington state and Ryan Smith, a small-business owner from California. And Obama said, "I'm signing this reform bill into law on behalf of my mother, who argued with insurance companies even as she battled cancer in her final days." Watch what Obama has to say about his mother and others Democratic senators and representatives filled the crowd, and all stood to cheer and applaud after Obama used 22 pens to sign the bill. Republicans and social conservatives are vowing to try to repeal the law or have it declared unconstitutional. Attorneys general from 13 states filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the measure, claiming its mandate for people to purchase coverage and the costs it forces states to assume violate the Constitution. Twelve of the 13 attorneys general filing the lawsuit are Republican. A separate lawsuit filed by the Republican attorney general of Virginia makes a similar claim. Watch what Florida's attorney general has to say Obama's comments at the signing ceremony and a later appearance before staff and supporters at the Department of the Interior focused on the immediate benefits of the new health care law. The president emphasized that this year, some 4 million small-business owners will be able to get tax credits to help cover the cost of providing health insurance to their employees, while insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage for children because of pre-existing medical conditions. Insurance companies also will no longer be allowed to drop people from coverage when they get sick, or to place lifetime or annual limits on the amount of health care people receive, Obama said. In addition, he warned senior citizens to ignore claims by Republicans that the new law will reduce Medicare benefits. Obama will hit the road to sell the measure to a still-skeptical public, giving a speech Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa, where he launched his grass-roots drive for health care reform in May 2007, according to White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. iReport: What will health care reform mean to you? Passage of the bill was a huge boost for Obama, who made health care reform a top domestic priority of his presidency. "I haven't seen the president so happy about anything other than his family since I've known him," senior adviser David Axelrod told CNN on Monday, adding that Obama's jubilation when the bill passed exceeded his election victory in November 2008. "He was excited that night, but not like last night." Senior Republicans in Congress warned that voters will judge Democrats harshly in November's mid-term elections, with Sen. John McCain of Arizona saying the Democratic-passed bill killed any chance of bipartisan support on legislation for the rest of the year. "There will be no cooperation for the rest of this year," McCain said in an interview Monday with KFYI radio in Arizona. "They have poisoned the well in what they have done and how they have done it." Gibbs, however, said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill, and he challenged McCain and other Republicans to campaign for the November election against the benefits of the health care bill. The overall $940 billion plan is projected to extend insurance coverage to roughly 32 million additional Americans. The compromise package would expand insurance subsidies for middle- and lower-income families, and scale back the bill's taxes on expensive insurance plans. iReport: Share your views on health care reform Observers warn, however, that the road ahead for health care reform in the Senate may be rocky. Democratic leaders are using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which will allow the compromise plan to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. But according to Senate rules, members are still allowed to offer unlimited amendments and challenges. In one of the first of many attempts Republicans say they will make to try to amend or kill the package, GOP aides went to Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin on Monday to argue that the compromise bill violates rules of the reconciliation process because of the way it affects Social Security. For that reason, GOP aides said they argued, the bill should not even be allowed to be debated. However, Frumin, according to a senior Republican and a Democratic aide, informed both parties he disagreed with the GOP assessment, and would not block the bill from reaching the Senate floor. House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative Senate. So far, two of the 59 senators in the Democratic caucus -- Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas -- have said they will oppose the compromise package. CNN's Ed Henry, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett, Ed Hornick, Josh Levs, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.
Hall of Fame football player and actor Merlin Olsen, a giant man who friends say had an even larger heart, died Thursday after a long battle with cancer, football and university officials said. He was 69. Known as much for his brain as his brawn, the 6-foot-5, 270-pound defensive tackle also graduated summa cum laude and Phi Kappa Phi from Utah State University in 1962 and earned a master's degree in economics in the off-season during his 15-year professional career. "Merlin Olsen was a coach's player. Punctual, steady, gifted, a quiet leader, a player you could always count on," says his biography on the National Football League Hall of Fame Web site. "He was a standout as a rookie and thereafter stood out in every game he played for the Rams in a 15-year career. Every game. Fifteen years." There may be no better evidence of Olsen's strength than his feat of playing in 208 professional games, the last 198 in a row. At Utah State University from 1959-1961, Olsen earned All-American honors during his junior and senior years. As a senior, he won the 1961 Outland Trophy as the nation's outstanding interior defensive lineman. After being drafted by the Rams with a No. 1 pick in 1962, Olsen was voted into the Pro Bowl as a rookie, the first of his 14 Pro Bowl appearances. He also made two All-Decade teams and was a six-time All-Pro. Olsen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982, his first year of eligibility. He accomplished all those feats while playing for a sometimes less-than-stellar Los Angeles Rams team before its move to St. Louis in 1995. "It was Olsen's hard luck to perform for many mediocre teams in Los Angeles -- he never won a Super Bowl -- but he had as much to do as any other individual with glamorizing defensive football in the NFL," his NFL biography says. For many years, Olsen was a member of the Rams' renowned "Fearsome Foursome" defensive line that included Deacon Jones, Roosevelt Grier and Lamar Lundy. After his professional playing career ended in 1976, Olsen turned to acting, appearing in movies and more than 100 TV episodes. He also worked as a television sports commentator. On TV, he may best be remembered for portraying the gentle Jonathan Garvey opposite Michael Landon on "Little House on the Prairie" from 1977 to 1981 and the lead role in "Father Murphy" from 1981 to 1983. In addition, Olsen did voice-overs in commercials for the floral delivery company FTD as well as commercials for syndicated airings of "The X-Files" TV program. He was remembered Thursday for his character and how he excelled in so many endeavors. "I can't think of anyone who has graduated from Utah State University who has accomplished more in a broader array of fields than Merlin Olsen," said Utah State University President Stan Albrecht. "His distinctive and powerful voice will be remembered for the breadth of its influence and by the impact it has had in so many different facets of our lives." The university also said Olsen will be recalled "as a tireless philanthropist, giving enormous amounts of time, talent and financial resources to numerous causes across the country." As a broadcaster, Olsen was partnered for years at NBC Sports with Dick Enberg, who recently described him as "the complete man." In a letter to Olsen, Utah State revealed Thursday, Enberg lauded Olsen's commitment to their weekly NFL telecasts. Enberg wrote of his partner's "uncommon willingness to prepare." "I'd often feel that I had given an 'A' effort in our broadcasts, only to recognize you earned the 'A-plus,' " Enberg wrote. Enberg said he also was struck by Olsen's inner self -- "a man of goodness, eager to consciously do the right thing for yourself, while helping others." Carroll Rosenbloom, owner of the Rams during Olsen's playing days, also spoke to Olsen's unblemished character. SI Vault: Read about Merlin Olsen's start in show business after 15 seasons with the Rams "The thing about him that I find remarkable is never once have I ever heard him say a negative word about anybody, in any circumstance," Rosenbloom said. "I just remember having a lot of admiration and respect for him, because he was a unique guy on the team, just the kind of person he is -- gentle and wonderful, and treated everybody so well." Rosenbloom's son Chip, majority owner of the St. Louis Rams, said Olsen will never be forgotten in team history. The Rams last honored him at a December 20 game in St. Louis. "In Rams history, there are maybe 10 guys who are iconic, and he's one of them," Rosenbloom said. "There's nobody who is more important." Olsen's alma mater likewise honored him in December, announcing at a basketball game half-time ceremony the naming of Merlin Olsen Field at Romney Stadium, a statue on the facility's southeast plaza and a scholarship endowment.
Kraft is recalling 96,000 pounds of hot dogs because packaging labels were incorrect, federal officials said Sunday. The Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners packages may have contained cheese dogs, officials said, but the packaging doesn't advise consumers that they contain milk, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement. The product labels "do not reflect the ingredients associated with the pasteurized cheese in the cheese dogs," the statement said. A consumer spotted the problem and notified the company on April 18. Kraft notified federal officials the next day, the statement said. In a statement on its Facebook page, Kraft said it was voluntarily recalling the hot dogs "because they may be mislabeled." The 16-ounce packages were produced in March and distributed throughout the United States. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.
At least 35 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in shootings and explosions across the country on Tuesday, officials with Iraq's interior ministry told CNN. Officials said 29 people were killed and 107 wounded in 11 car bomb explosions in nine different parts of Baghdad. Most of killed and wounded were civilians, officials said. In Falluja, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad, five people were killed and 12 others were wounded when gunmen attacked al-Tahadi police station in southern Falluja. In northern Mosul, about 400 kilometers (249 miles) north of Baghdad, a bomb exploded in the convoy of army Gen. Mohammed Khamas, killing him instantly. Khamas was the deputy head of army intelligence department in Mosul. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in friction between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunnis have felt politically marginalized under Shiite President Nuri al-Maliki, whose government fears it is being targeted by Sunni Islamists involved in fighting in neighboring Syria. More than 800 Iraqis were killed and 2,030 wounded in violence and acts of terrorism in August, the United Nations said.
Pope Benedict XVI presided over Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, delivering a homily that focused on the "essence" of the holiday rather than the "commercial celebration" it has become. "Today Christmas has become a commercial celebration, whose bright lights hide the mystery of God's humility, which in turn calls us to humility and simplicity," the pope said after recalling the story of Christmas. "Let us ask the Lord to help us see through the superficial glitter of this season, and to discover behind it the child in the stable in Bethlehem, so as to find true joy and true light." The 84-year-old pope, presiding over his seventh mass as pontiff, also conjured up an image of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, explaining that visitors must bend down to enter its low opening, drawing a tie to what followers of Christ must do to find their faith. "If we want to find the God who appeared as a child, then we must dismount from the high horse of our 'enlightened' reason," he said. "... In this spirit let us celebrate the liturgy of the holy night, let us strip away our fixation on what is material, on what can be measured and grasped." The pope started off Saturday's celebrations by lighting a peace candle in the window of his study during the unveiling of a larger-than-life nativity scene in St. Peter's Square. The scene, at 23 feet high and 82 feet wide, is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, according to the Vatican's news agency. Thousands poured into the square and St. Peter's Basilica ahead of the Midnight Mass, which was actually held at 10 p.m. this year. Before his homily, the aging pontiff rode down St. Peter's long aisle on a wheeled platform, waving to worshipers. Benedict will follow the Christmas Eve celebrations with his annual Christmas message "To the City and To the World" -- Urbi et Orbi in Latin -- on Sunday.
seven of them children -- are alive and well. 'Truly a miracle' It was no stroke of luck but an act of God that her father caught hepatitis, said Inge Goreti Ferdiningsih, because it made her family cancel their tickets on the AirAsia flight a day before it took off. "We are extremely grateful, and God is really great," she said. "I believe that God is saving and protecting us, and this is truly a miracle." Inge Goreti booked the family vacation nine months earlier. Her father wasn't booked on the trip, and her younger sister was staying by his side. So, Inge Goreti could still have gone, with her husband and three children. 'Feeling in my heart' The bags stood packed and ready, and the family was full of anticipation for the Singapore vacation. Christopher 10, Nadine, 7, and Felix, 5, were psyched about taking a local ship cruise, splashing at a water park and watching animals perform at Sea World. But then Inge Goreti's sister called from a hospital, where she had taken their father after he complained of stomach pains. The diagnosis: hepatitis. The news tugged at her. "I had this feeling in my heart that I wanted to be with my dad," Inge Goreti said. So, she called off the trip Saturday, a day before the flight. Christopher had a hard time accepting it. He was so looking forward to the trip and became very upset, she said. 'We were late' An aversion to phone messages may have spared another family. Christianawati was going to ring in the New Year in Singapore with her family and her brother's family, she told a French news agency. Ten were traveling in all. But her brother forgot to check messages from AirAsia telling them that the flight was leaving two hours before the original departure time. "They emailed and called us on December 15 and 16 to inform us, but we missed those calls," Christianawati, who goes by one name, told Agence France-Presse. "So we arrived at the airport to check in for the 7:30 a.m. flight but were told our flights had been rescheduled to 5:30 a.m., and we were late. Of course we were angry," she said. Some family members pulled up in their car just in time to see the last passengers whisk past them into the boarding lounge, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. But Christianawati's family was traveling in two cars, and one was lagging behind. They just missed the flight. Then they heard the news. "Maybe it is all God's plan that my family and I were not on the flight," Christianawati said. "It was a blessing in disguise." 'Broke down and cried' Early Sunday, at Inge Goreti's home, the phone rang -- a few times. "We received calls from relatives regarding the plane that lost contact," Inge Goreti said. "We all broke down and cried." Sunday evening, the family went to church to give thanks. But mixed with Inge Goreti's tears of relief have been tears of sadness. She recognized names on Flight QZ8501's passenger manifest, she said. Friends and colleagues were on board.
Chris Aire is known as "the King of Bling," the jeweler to the stars whose dazzling creations are worn by the likes of Angelina Jolie, 50 Cent and Shaquille O'Neal. But although he might be regularly rubbing shoulders with Hollywood superstars, famous musicians and elite athletes today, there was a time when the Nigerian-born designer could only dream about approaching a celebrity. More than two decades ago, Aire used to hang outside five star hotels and trendy bars in Los Angeles in the hope of showing his designs to a potential star client. "I had my little coach bag," remembers Aire. "I had everything in it 'cause seriously I didn't know any of these guys. So walking up to them you really have just a minute -- if even that -- to say 'yo, this is what I've got,'" he adds. "I had instances where people thought I was selling hot items -- 'this dude out here man, he's got some stolen stuff.'" Read this: Africa's first design museum But after a year of frequenting celeb hotspots, exhausting his savings in the process, Aire's big break finally came following an L.A.-based encounter with Gary Payton, the NBA star playing for the Seattle Supersonics at the time. "I was just hanging out at a hotel waiting for him because I knew he was going to be there," remembers Aire. "And when he came down, the press rush that he had, he would have been justified in saying, 'hey man get out of my way." Instead, Payton invited Aire to go later that year to a charity event in Miami and show him his creations. There was only one problem: Aire had no money. Undeterred, Aire decided to max out his credit card and buy an airline ticket to Miami, even though he couldn't afford a return flight to L.A. But when he got to Florida, Payton was so impressed with his designs that he immediately placed a $50,000 order, buying a platinum basketball pendant for himself and other jewelry for his friends. "That sale transformed my life," says Aire. "Not only did I pay for the flight ticket, I had enough to start building and doing a bunch of my own collection." 'Leap of faith' The son of a successful Nigerian businessman, Aire grew up in the West African country's Ivue Uromi region. His father wanted him to go into the family oil business, but instead Aire left Nigeria aged 18 to go to college in the United States. But while working on getting his education, Aire had also to find a way of supporting himself. His first job was flipping burgers in a fast-food restaurant overnight. Read this: Tribal beauty of vanishing life "I would work from 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and then I'll go home, get a couple of hours nap and then go to school at nine," recalls Aire. "I was at school from 9 until about 4 pm -- and then I went home, got ready and repeated that again, five days a week." After graduating from college, Aire tried his luck briefly as an actor and singer, before making his foray into jewelry with the help of a friend whose father was a jeweler. Starting from the bottom, Aire worked his way up, learning the craft and understanding everything about gold, diamonds and other colored gem stones. After six years of apprenticing under his friend's father, Aire had managed to save $5,000. He then decided it was time to strike out on his own and form his own company. "It was a leap of faith and I took that leap of faith," says Aire. "I was very confident in my faith because I believe whatever it is that puts the inspiration in your mind has within it its own fulfillment." 'Massive wealth' Since then, Aire has managed to build a thriving company whose A-list clientele is a roll call of cinema and music superstars. In 2004, Aire made fashion history when he became the first jeweler to stage a runway show at New York Fashion Week. His sparkling creations include a diamond encrusted cuff -- priced at $1.7 million -- and a $500,000 diamond-coated guitar for hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean. But even though he mixes with the rich and famous, Aire has not forgotten where he came from. He frequently visits Nigeria and is optimistic about the future of both his country and his continent. "I think there is going to be a time when Africa, starting with Nigeria, becomes the envy of luxury market," he says. "There's massive wealth here but the Western impression of Africa has always been a country of people in need of charity, in need of aid, but Africa really is the last frontier." Aire also believes that people in the continent should support local designers and luxury brands, which in turn can speed up the growth of African businesses. "We have to embrace our own so that the next Louis Vuitton or Chanel comes out of Africa. So we are positioning ourselves to be that breakout brand from Africa."
Lights went off across the world Saturday as millions of homes and businesses went dark for one hour in a symbolic gesture highlighting concerns over climate change. The lights go off Saturday at the Houses of Parliament and the Big Ben clock tower in central London. More than 2,800 cities and towns worldwide dimmed their lights at 8:30 p.m. local time for the third annual Earth Hour -- a day-long energy-saving marathon spanning 83 countries and 24 time zones. In New York, the Empire State Building, Central Park and the George Washington Bridge went dark at 8:30 p.m. ET. The Philippines topped this year's participation for Asia, with more than 650 communities taking part in the event, according to Earth Hour's Web site. The light illuminating the face of the landmark Big Ben clock tower in London, England, went out at 8:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET). In Dubai, iReporter Sharad Agarwal turned out the lights and sat down to a candlelit dinner with his family. "I personally believe in going green and everything that goes with it," Agarwal told CNN. In Australia, floodlights of the Sydney Opera House were extinguished as the city's iconic harbor kicked off events for Earth Hour. The event's Web site reported that hundreds of people lined the harbor for a glimpse of the dimming skyline at 8:30 pm. Sydney became the birthplace of the Earth Hour campaign in 2007 when 2.2 million turned off their lights, igniting a grass-roots movement that has become a global phenomenon. In China, illuminations at major buildings including the "Bird's Nest" Olympic Stadium and the Water Cube were extinguished as 20 cities joined in, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Other landmarks around the world expected to join the World Wildlife Fund-sponsored event were the Egyptian pyramids, Vatican, Niagara Falls, the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building, the Acropolis in Athens and the Las Vegas casino strip. CNN iReporter Marie Sager of Los Angeles, California, said she planned to hike up to the Griffith Observatory to experience the massive lights-out event. "A good portion of the city is participating. We'll see the Capital Records sign go out. A lot of these places haven't turned out their lights in awhile," Sager said. Event sponsors hoped participating U.S. cities would set an example for the rest of the world.  Watch actor Edward Norton and Carter Roberts of the World Wildlife Fund discuss event » "We think we are going to have 100 million people around the world sending a message that climate change is real, and we need to take action now," World Wildlife Fund CEO Carter Roberts told CNN. "The world is watching to see what America is going to do," he said, "because if America acts on climate change, the world will follow." Earth Hour events got off to an unofficial start in the remote Chatham Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean where locals switched off their diesel generators, organizers said. Shortly afterward, 44 New Zealand cities and town joined in the event. Organizers say they hope this year's event will send a message to world leaders meeting Copenhagen, Denmark, in December for a major summit on climate change. "We are asking one billion people to take part in what is essentially the first global vote for action on climate change by turning off their lights for one hour and casting a vote for earth," said executive director Andy Ridley.
A British couple convicted for having sex on a public beach in Dubai will not face jail after a judge suspended their prison sentences, their lawyer said Tuesday. File image of one of the co-accused -- Vince Acors -- arriving at court in Dubai in September. The couple, Michelle Palmer and Vincent Acors, had faced a three-month sentence, but they were freed on bail in October pending an appeal. Hassan Mattar, one of their lawyers, said he was trying to get permission for Palmer -- who worked in Dubai -- to stay in the United Arab Emirates, and for Acors to travel back to Britain. Acors had been on a business trip to Dubai when he was arrested. The United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, is home to thousands of expatriates and is among the most moderate Gulf states. Still, the oil-rich kingdom adheres to certain Islamic rules. Palmer and Acors were arrested on a public beach shortly after midnight on July 5. Police charged them with illicit relations, public indecency, and public intoxication. A court found them guilty in October and fined them 1,000 dirhams ($367) for the charge of public indecency. Both denied they had intercourse. And during the trial, Mattar argued that the public prosecutor failed to produce corroborative evidence against his clients on the first two charges, though he said both tested positive for liquor. More than a million British visitors traveled to the UAE in 2006, and more than 100,000 British nationals live there, according to the British Foreign Office. The country is in the midst of a building boom to position itself as one of the world's premier tourist destinations. It is already home to the world's largest mall, the world's largest tower, and -- despite being in the Middle East -- the largest indoor snow park in the world. -- CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.
Indian lawmakers cast ballots Thursday to elect a new president for the South Asian democracy, with the ruling party's candidate considered the almost-certain winner. That candidate, Pranab Mukherjee, is a veteran politician and a former finance minister. Mukherjee's rival is opposition-backed candidate P.A. Sangma, a former speaker of the Indian parliament. Indian presidents are elected through an electoral college made up of more than 4,800 federal and state lawmakers. The result from Thursday's vote are expected to be announced Sunday. Blog: What happened to 'Incredible India'? In India, the president is head of state while the prime minister heads the government. Still, the Indian presidents, in their largely ceremonial position, hold considerable power as the supreme commander of the country's armed forces and custodian of the national constitution, political commentator K.G. Suresh explained. The new president could play a key role in deciding who forms the next government in case the next general elections, due in 2014, result in a split parliament, analysts say. "Now we have a coalition era. We do not know in 2014, when the parliament election takes place, which party would be able to get a clear majority," Suresh said. "If it doesn't happen, the president of India has to then take a call as to whom to invite (to form the government) within the parameters of the constitution of India." Prime minister Manmohan Singh was among voters who cast their ballots Thursday. The new president will replace Pratibha Devisingh Patil, the first woman to hold the post. Mukherjee was named the presidential candidate by the ruling United Progressive Alliance headed by Sonia Gandhi, who is also the chief of India's Congress Party.
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected separate appeals from two Texas death row inmates, one involving an admission of an illicit affair between the prosecutor and the trial judge. The justices without comment turned aside Charles Hood's challenge of his conviction. A state appeals court earlier this year ordered a new trial on the sentencing phase. Hood was convicted of the 1989 murder of Tracie Lynn Wallace and her boyfriend Ronald Williamson in their home outside Plano, Texas, which is just north of Dallas. The former nightclub bouncer has denied the charges. He was arrested while driving the victim's car and his fingerprints were found at the murder scene. It was only after the trial that Hood's lawyers learned of the romantic relationship between then-Judge Verla Sue Holland and one-time district attorney Tom O'Connell. Various state courts have rejected the assertion the affair cost Hood a fair trial. His lawyers Monday vowed to continue the fight to prove his innocence. "We are disheartened that the United States Supreme Court ruled not to hear the case of Charles Hood in which the trial judge and district attorney who prosecuted Hood engaged in a secret, long-term, extramarital affair," said Andrea Keilen, director of the Texas Defender Service, a legal group representing Hood. "This is particularly disappointing given that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to date has ignored this obvious and outrageous constitutional violation." After her stint as a trial judge, Holland joined the state's highest criminal appeals court before resigning in 2001. That is the same court that ruled in February that Hood deserved a new trial on his punishment. The judges did not mention the affair in that decision. But the state high court last year refused Hood a new trial based on the admission of the affair. Neither the judge nor prosecutor were sanctioned for their behavior by the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct or by the state bar. The case is Hood v. Texas (09-8610). In the separate appeal, the high court refused to intervene on behalf of one of the nation's longest serving death row inmates. Delma Banks was convicted of the murder 30-years ago this week of 16-year-old Richard Whitehead in eastern Texas. Banks' original 2003 execution date was postponed over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct at his trial. Various courts have since allowed the execution to go forward. Banks' attorneys claim faulty eyewitness testimony and the exclusion of blacks on the all-white jury prevented him from receiving a fair trial. Banks is African-American, his victim was white. The case is Banks v. Thaler (09-717). The justices also put off a decision on another high-profile capital case from Texas, which executes more prisoners per year than any other state. Henry "Hank" Skinner has made an actual innocence claim, demanding DNA testing on other evidence gathered at the crime scene. The justices had issued a stay just before his scheduled March 24 execution, to consider whether capital inmates have a basic right to have forensic evidence reviewed. Skinner, 47, was convicted of the the New Year's Eve 1993 killings of his live-in girlfriend and her two sons. He strongly denies any involvement. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has received more than 8,000 letters from Skinner's advocates urging a new trial, according to the Innocence Project and Change.org, whose members and supporters have sent the letters through their Web sites. Prosecutors maintain forensic evidence gathered at the scene and witness statements point to Skinner. The Supreme Court had scheduled the appeal for decision Monday. The justices are now expected to again take up the Skinner case later this week, and would decide whether to hear oral arguments on the larger constitutional questions presented. They have no deadline on deciding the matter. The case is Skinner v. Switzer (09-9000).
Mike Myers' "Love Guru" may speak of "yin and yang," but the Hollywood version of bad balanced by good might be the Razzies and the Oscars. Mike Myers' "The Love Guru" was one of the year's biggest bombs. The day before the Motion Picture Academy releases the Oscar nominations -- honoring the movie industry's best -- the Golden Raspberry Award foundation reveals nominations for the Razzies, which recognize the worst films of 2008. And in 2008, Razzie founder and self-styled "Head Raspberry" John Wilson said, the bad seemed to outweigh the good among the 578 movies released. "We are saying that it wasn't just the economy that tanked," Wilson said. "So did the quality of the movies being offered to those of us who don't have as much money to buy tickets." "All of the voting was very close this year," he said. "There just was too much stuff to choose from." The bumper crop of "putrid motion pictures" may be partly a result of last spring's writers' strike "when nobody was rewriting, polishing or improving anything and it was still getting filmed," Wilson said. Bombs also happen when studios hedge their bets with high-priced stars by having them "do what worked before, coming back to same well." Which brings us back to Myers' "Love Guru," which followed his hugely profitable "Austin Powers" franchise. Myers' portrayal of "a platitude-spouting mystic" leads the Razzie list for worst picture, Wilson said. It may also have been the biggest box office bomb: the film, expected to be a summer hit, lost $30 million, he said. Other worst picture nominees include "Disaster Movie" and "Meet the Spartans" -- both featuring the same writer-directors and essentially the same cast. The latter film "somehow managed to work references to Britney Spears into an ancient Spartan 'plot,' " Wilson said. Also competing for the top dishonor is "The Happening," which Wilson described as "an eco-disaster tale whose 'villain' drew more guffaws than gasps," and Paris Hilton's "The Hottie and the Nottie," which earned three Razzie nominations overall. "She really is neither a movie star or an actress," Wilson said of Hilton. The movie -- for which Hilton was listed as executive producer -- sold only $27,000 in tickets but cost about $2 million to make. Other Razzie nominees include actor-comedian Eddie Murphy, who received two nominations for "Meet Dave"; Oscar winner Al Pacino, who earned a Razzie nod for making "two rotten movies this year," in Wilson's words (he's referring to "88 Minutes" and "Righteous Kill"); and "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," which was singled out as "Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel." Despite the opinions of Wilson and the Razzie voters, it was the year's third-highest-grossing movie. And a rare Razzie for "Worst Career Achievement" will go to "Bad Movie Uber-Meister" Uwe Boll for "In the Name of the King," Wilson said. The film, based on a video game, had a $60 million budget, yet brought in under $5 million at the box office, he said. Wilson said he began the Razzies in 1981 as a counterpoint to the Oscars. It takes guts to show up in person to accept a Razzie, but some notable actors have embraced the infamy, Wilson said. Tom Green, who made "a horrible little thing called 'Freddy Got Fingered' " several years ago, "insisted that he made the film with the intent of sweeping the Razzie Awards," Wilson said. Green showed up to accept his three awards with great enthusiasm, he said. "At the end of the ceremony, he launched into a harmonica solo and we had to pry his hands off the podium and physically remove him from the stage," Wilson said. The classiest and most memorable acceptance speech came in 2005 when Halle Berry showed up to get her worst actress Razzie for her "Catwoman" performance. Berry, who won a best actress Oscar for "Monster's Ball" in 2001, was given a one-minute standing ovation, Wilson said. "She had her Oscar in one hand and her Razzie in the other," Wilson said. Berry's speech was a parody of her Academy Award acceptance and "she was quite funny," he said. "She said that her mother had taught her that if you cannot accept valid criticism, you also, by the same token, are not entitled to bask in the glory when you get the good reviews," he said. The appearance and her sense of humor earned Berry a lot of respect, he said. The awards show -- a "shorter parody" of the Oscars -- can be seen only by members and journalists in person at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Hollywood on February 21. It cannot be televised or streamed online because studios would likely withhold permission for clips used in the presentation to be shown, Wilson said. Unlike the Oscars and other honors, Golden Raspberry Awards are not meant as recommendations for people to rent the DVDs, Wilson said. "If you were going to do that, I would suggest you put away all sharp implements before putting the DVDs in your machine," he said.
When Frederick Hutson left prison in 2012 after serving four years on marijuana-related charges, he realized he had gained something more than his freedom: insight into an overlooked consumer market. Many inmates are stuck in an age before Instagram or Facebook, relying on envelopes and pay phones to connect with family on the outside. So Hutson founded Pigeonly, a photo-sharing and low-cost phone call service that has already helped 50,000 incarcerated individuals connect with their loved ones, maintain their ties to society, and remain a presence in their children's lives. The story of Pigeonly is statistically unlikely: a disruptive technology created by a member of a disenfranchised community, in order to solve a problem within that community. It is also a model for the type of entrepreneurship that can revive American capitalism: both inclusive of and responsive to America's changing demographics. One of the great achievements of the civil rights and women's rights movements was that they unleashed an enormous pool of talent into the economic life of America. Desegregation and the women's movement broke down barriers to education and employment and made our nation stronger by making it more competitive. Yet 50 years later, a narrow vision of capitalism once again threatens to leave many Americans behind. Our nation's failure to achieve equal educational opportunity has exacerbated race-based economic disparities and produced two starkly different American economies. And while women have made strong gains in professional life, they remain dramatically underrepresented in many of the most profitable sectors. Silicon Valley is hardly the only place where this is evident, but addressing it here is crucial to turning the tide. Last year there were eight states where zero Latino students took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science, and 11 states in which no black students took the test. In three states, not a single female student sat for the exam. It is no surprise, then, that 99% of venture capital-funded startups in 2010 were founded by whites or people of Asian descent, the vast majority of whom were men. The result of this pipeline problem is an enormous amount of untapped talent and a tech sector that fails to reflect the demographics of its users. To be sure, government can play a crucial role in leveling the playing field. But it can only go so far. The leaders of the innovation economy can and should play their part in reviving capitalism by making it more responsive to a changing country's full range of widespread needs and more inclusive in the process. This is a practical demand as much as a moral one. Underrepresented populations are uniquely prepared to do what the tech sector claims to do best: innovate. Look at the app store on any smartphone. There are thousands of programs to edit a photo or help you check the weather, but far fewer that exist to close the gaps in our society. In Silicon Valley, we like to say that every problem is a potential opportunity. But it takes a diversity of backgrounds to identify the real-world problems begging for a solution. Simply put, startups like Pigeonly are shattering expectations of what the market demands. Smart investors are looking at firms like Regalii, which helps immigrants send cash remittances back to their home countries, or Plaza Familia, a Latina-founded multilingual education software platform that helps parents track their children's' school progress in their native language. Our firm, Kapor Capital, invests in these companies and dozens of others that work to close gaps. We saw that startups like Pigeonly were launched by entrepreneurs who identified an unmet need in the market as a result of their life experiences. Silicon Valley tells an idealistic story of itself and the revolutionary role of tech leaders in the 21st century economy. Tech innovation can and should expand wealth, democratize access to opportunity, and build a meritocracy where talent matters most. However, we still have a long way to go. We will be there when companies like Pigeonly, Regalii, and Plaza Familia and their founders -- African-Americans, Latinos, women of all colors, and others historically excluded -- are no longer the exception to the rule. Capitalism remains our nation's operating system. The current version needs an upgrade. Investing in the people who are too often locked out, and their ideas, can advance our economy and our country to the next level. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.
The family of long-missing former FBI agent Robert Levinson has renewed its request for a meeting with the bureau's new director following reports Levinson had been working for the CIA when he vanished, the family's lawyer said Monday. Levinson disappeared on a trip to Iran in 2007, and U.S. officials say they have no idea where he is now. The Associated Press and The Washington Post reported last week that he had been working as a contractor for the CIA, but the White House said Levinson "was not a U.S. government employee" when he disappeared. Family attorney David McGee said Levinson's relatives were supposed to meet with FBI Director James Comey about the case long before it became publicly known that Levinson was working for the CIA. The FBI has delayed previously scheduled meetings since Comey took over as director in September, McGee says. A U.S. law enforcement official said the FBI is working to set up that meeting with Comey, who has been traveling extensively, and the bureau hopes to arrange that meeting soon. Missing American Robert Levinson not 'abandoned' in Iran, John Kerry says Levinson, now 65, had gone to Iran on a mission to investigate corruption involving the laundering of oil profits by Iranian officials, including former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, according to a source. Iran has consistently denied having any knowledge of Levinson's whereabouts, and there has been no sign of him since a 2010 video. At the time of his disappearance, the State Department said he was on a private business trip investigating cigarette smuggling and said he was not working for the government. His family had also said he wasn't working for the government. Levinson was on the CIA books as an "analyst," to write academic papers, with money laundering a particular area of expertise, McGee said. But in reality, Levinson was an operative traveling overseas, recruiting, and interviewing sources. McGee said records he found show "without a shadow of a doubt" that Levinson was a CIA contract employee on a rogue assignment in Iran for the agency when he disappeared. After Levinson disappeared, McGee said he called people at the CIA to tell them they had a man missing. Nothing happened, McGee said. When the Levinson family first went to the Senate Intelligence Committee for help, staffers contacted the CIA and at that point, the CIA told them "they have no connection with him at all," McGee said. White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip The family then found documentation and returned to the Intelligence Committee, giving staffers what they call "smoking gun" evidence. The documents included Levinson's contract and expense reports that detailed his previous assignments, including a detailed 2006 report of his work on a separate mission regarding Iran's nuclear program. That mission did not take him to Iran. The family also had e-mails regarding his pending 2007 trip to Iran involving his instructions with Dawud Salahuddin, an American fugitive who lives in Iran. Salahuddin has said he met with Levinson in a hotel on Kish Island on March 8, 2007. The meeting was an effort to put Levinson in touch with Iranian authorities to help the American investigate cigarette smuggling as a contractor for a tobacco company. In classified Intelligence Committee meetings that followed, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson gave then-CIA Director Michael Hayden a "grilling," McGee said. Confronted with the evidence, the CIA then demurred, said it would get back in touch and later admitted the relationship with Levinson, he said. In the meantime, the CIA paid the family $120,000 for Levinson's trip and eventually settled for $2.5 million to avoid a lawsuit, according to McGee. Ultimately, seven CIA staffers were disciplined and three were fired, McGee said -- including Levinson's chief handler. Reports: American who went missing in Iran worked for CIA CNN Justice Reporter Evan Perez contributed to this report.
including Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city -- by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. But they shouldn't be. The collapse of the Iraqi government's troops in Mosul and other northern cities in the face of Sunni militant resistance has been the predictable culmination of a long deterioration, brought on by the government's politicization of its security forces. The politicization of the Iraqi military For more than five years, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his ministers have presided over the packing of the Iraqi military and police with Shiite loyalists -- in both the general officer ranks and the rank and file -- while sidelining many effective commanders who led Iraqi troops in the battlefield gains of 2007-2010, a period during which al Qaeda in Iraq (the forerunner of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) was brought to the brink of extinction. Al-Maliki's "Shiafication" of the Iraqi security forces has been less about the security of Iraq than the security of Baghdad and his regime. Even before the end of the U.S.-led "surge" in 2008, al-Maliki began a concerted effort to replace effective Sunni and Kurdish commanders and intelligence officers in the key mixed-sect areas of Baghdad, Diyala and Salaheddin provinces to ensure that Iraqi units focused on fighting Sunni insurgents while leaving loyal Shiite militias alone -- and to alleviate al-Maliki's irrational fears of a military coup against his government. In 2008, al-Maliki began replacing effective Kurdish commanders and soldiers in Mosul and Tal Afar with Shiite loyalists from Baghdad and the Prime Minister's Dawa Party, and even Shiite militia members from the south. A number of nonloyalist commanders were forced to resign in the face of trumped up charges or reassigned to desk jobs and replaced with al-Maliki loyalists. The moves were made to marginalize Sunnis and Kurds in the north and entrench al-Maliki's regime and the Dawa Party ahead of provincial and national elections in 2009, 2010 and 2013. The dismantling of the 'Awakening' It's no accident that there exists today virtually no Sunni popular resistance to ISIS, but rather the result of a conscious al-Maliki government policy to marginalize the Sunni tribal "Awakening" that deployed more than 90,000 Sunni fighters against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. These 90,000 "Sons of Iraq" made a significant contribution to the reported 90% drop in sectarian violence in 2007-2008,  assisting the Iraqi security forces and the United States in securing territory from Mosul to the Sunni enclaves of Baghdad and the surrounding Baghdad "belts." As the situation stabilized, the Iraqi government agreed to a plan to integrate vetted Sunni members of the Sons of Iraq into the Iraqi army and police to make those forces more representative of the overall Iraqi population. But this integration never happened. Al-Maliki was comfortable touting his support for the Sons of Iraq in non-Shiite areas such as Anbar and Nineveh provinces, but he refused to absorb Sunnis into the ranks of the security forces along Shiite-Sunni fault lines in central Iraq. In areas with (or near) Shiite populations, al-Maliki saw the U.S.-backed Sons of Iraq as a threat, and he systematically set out to dismantle the program over the next four years. As this process played out, we saw its effects firsthand in our interactions with Iraqi government officials and tribal leaders in Baghdad, where it was clear the Sons of Iraq were under increasing pressure from both the government and al Qaeda. By 2013, the Sons of Iraq were virtually nonexistent, with thousands of their sidelined former members either neutral or aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in its war against the Iraqi government. The disappearance of the Sons of Iraq meant that few Sunnis in western and northern Iraq had a stake in the defense of their own communities. The vast system of security forces and Sunni tribal auxiliaries that had made the Sunni provinces of Iraq hostile territory for al Qaeda was dismantled. The militant gains in Mosul and other cities of the north and Anbar are the direct result of the removal of the Iraqi security forces commanders and local Sons of Iraq leaders who had turned the tide against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. Those commanders who had a reason to secure and hold territory in the north were replaced with al-Maliki loyalists from Baghdad who, when the bullets began to fly, had no interest in dying for Sunni and Kurdish territory. And when the commanders left the battlefield this week, their troops melted away as well. What can be done? The problem will only get worse in the coming months. Now that the Iraqi government's weakness in Sunni territories has been exposed, other Sunni extremist groups are joining forces with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  to exploit the opening. The Baathist-affiliated Naqshbandi Army and the Salafist Ansar al-Sunna Army are reportedly taking part in the offensive as well, and they are drawing support from a Sunni population that believes itself persecuted and disenfranchised by al-Maliki's government and threatened by Shiite militias that are his political allies. For six months, Shiite militants have been allowed or encouraged by the government to conduct sectarian cleansing in mixed areas around Baghdad, particularly in Diyala province between Baghdad and the Iranian border. These events contributed to the motivation of Sunnis who have taken up arms or acquiesced in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's offensive. Even as the ISIS tide rolls southward down the Tigris, there is probably little danger of Baghdad and other Shiite areas falling into Sunni insurgent hands. The Shiite troops unwilling to fight to hold onto Mosul will be far more motivated to fight to protect Shiite territories in central and southern Iraq and to defend the sectarian fault line. This is their home territory, where they have the advantage of local knowledge, and where they have successfully fought the Sunni insurgency for years. In the north, however, al-Maliki now has two military options. He can reconsolidate his shattered forces along sectarian fault lines to defend Shiite territories in central Iraq, ceding Sunni areas to the insurgency, or he can regroup his security forces at their bases north of Baghdad and mount expeditions to conduct "cordon and search" operations in Sunni areas lost to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. If al-Maliki chooses to regroup and move on Sunni population centers controlled by the ISIS, we are likely to see Shiite troops unfamiliar with Sunni neighborhoods employing heavy-handed tactics, bluntly targeting Sunni military-age males (12-60) not affiliated with the insurgency and further inflaming sectarian tensions as they do so -- reminiscent of the situation in many parts of Iraq in 2005-2006. The problem at its core is not just a matter of security, but politics. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and its allies would not have had the opportunity to seize ground in the Sunni Arab-dominated provinces of Salaheddin, Nineveh and Anbar if there had been more inclusive and sincere political outreach to the mainstream Sunni Arab community. In the end, the solution to the ISIS threat is a fundamental change in Iraq's political discourse, which has become dominated by one sect and one man, and the inclusion of mainstream Sunni Arabs and Kurds as full partners in the state. If al-Maliki truly wishes to restore government control to the Sunni provinces, he must reach out to Sunni and Kurdish leaders and ask for their help, and he must re-enlist former Sons of Iraq leaders, purged military commanders and Kurdish Peshmerga to help regain the territory they once helped the Iraqi government defend. But these are steps a-Maliki has shown himself unwilling and unlikely to take. At this point, al-Maliki does not have what it takes to address Iraq's problem -- because he is the problem.
The thorny intersection of race and the economy topped the political agenda Wednesday as President Obama huddled with key African-American leaders at the White House. Obama held what has been dubbed an "urban economy summit" in the Oval Office with a group including the Rev. Al Sharpton, NAACP President Benjamin Jealous, and National Urban League President Marc Morial. National Council of Negro Women Chairwoman Dorothy Height, who is 97 years old, declined an invitation to attend due to the winter storm pounding the Washington area. The group urged Obama to spend money initially reserved for bank bailouts on areas suffering from chronically high unemployment, according to sources familiar with the attendees' plans. The investments should be "place-based rather than race-based," Jealous said. The cornerstone of the civil rights leaders' plan calls for $150 billion in TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) funds to be redirected to state and local governments to hire workers to provide critical services in underserved communities. The White House has not yet proposed tapping the TARP fund for a new jobs program, with the exception of potentially using it to help expand credit lines for small businesses. The nation's first African-American president remains extremely popular among black voters. A number of African-American leaders, however, are increasingly upset with what they perceive as the federal government's inattention to the needs of economically hard-hit minority communities. "We do not seek any special kind of edict or special kind of thing from the president because he's African-American," Sharpton said. But he said African-Americans do "expect to be included in the process" as Congress debates a new jobs bill and are seeking "substantive change" and not mere "feel-good moments." Jealous blasted what some political observers have characterized as a GOP strategy of complete opposition to Obama's agenda. The Republicans are using obstructionist "tactics from the last century" previously employed against African-Americans and now used "against working people," he said.  "It's not enough to say no, no, no when people ... are suffering, suffering, suffering," he said. "It's not enough to just hold up progress." While the national unemployment rate is now 9.7 percent, the jobless rate among African-Americans is hovering around 15 percent. Over 40 percent of black teenagers are unemployed, according to the National Urban League. Obama has previously argued that the administration's $862 billion stimulus package, as well as its other job growth initiatives, would benefit many of the country's hardest-hit communities. The plan presented to Obama was expected to include recommendations to: • Expand the small business administration's Community Express Loan Program; • Provide a stronger focus on communities with high unemployment; • Invest $500 million for housing counselors to work with people who are delinquent on loans; • Expand summer youth jobs programs by investing up to $7 billion to employ 5 million teenagers; • Create 100 "urban job academies" to train the chronically unemployed.

A nonpartisan panel reporting to Congress says the United States is wasting $12 million a day among contracts issued in support of American efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Commission on Wartime Contracting spent the past three years documenting whether American funding went where it was supposed to. The findings show misdirected money has totaled between $31 billion and $60 billion, and that both the government and the contractors are to blame for fraud and waste. Commissioner Katherine Schinasi told reporters at a news conference Wednesday that the numbers don't seem to have an impact on people concerned about spending. To make it easier to grasp the magnitude of the problem, Schinasi said, "we've broken it down to $12 million a day." "We are wasting $12 million a day," she said, "maybe that will make a difference." The study looked at contracts from 2001 through the projected end of fiscal year 2011. Without contract reform and better oversight, future prospects look just as ominous, the panel members warned, as the U.S. considers a role rebuilding Libya in a post-Gadhafi time frame. Dov Zakheim, a former comptroller at the Defense Department, said he believes the misdirected money is closer to $60 billion, not the low end of the range the panel itself has estimated. "We also have to think about projects that we start, but are not sure can be finished or sustained," he said. "What is the point of spending hundreds of millions on projects that will then fall into disuse?" he asked, saying the choice then becomes writing off the investment, or "spending taxpayer money for God knows how long, in order to keep the projects going." The panel issued 15 recommendations for contract reform, including hiring more auditors and analysts to make sure the government gets what was paid for. The report was delivered to congressional staffers early Wednesday; lawmakers are on summer break. A paper statement was left with reporters from Rep. John Tierney of Massachusetts, who said the panel's findings "are alarming." Tierney, the ranking Democrat on a House subcommittee that reviews foreign operations, said he will introduce a bill next week "to create a permanent inspector general for contingency operations." Such a move is among the recommendations of the commission. Tierney's statement continued: "The kind of waste we have witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan cannot be repeated." The commission was a provision of the 2008 Defense Department budget, mandating an investigation into the reliance on contractors for security, logistics, and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the three-year probe, the panel held 25 formal hearings, and published two interim reports and five special reports to Congress.
The conventional wisdom, among most folks, anyway, is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity, by those on a budget -- that is, people who want, or need, to "move down" from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach. Bottom line, the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability. However, there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income: used luxury cars. For some buyers, the used-luxury market is a way of getting into that Lexus, Lincoln, Infiniti or Porsche you always wanted, without laying out $70,000 or $80,000 for something you're not actually going to live in. For others, scouring the used-luxury-car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth. At this point, some of these used-luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions. Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range. Using CR's recommendations as a guideline, here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $24,000-30,000 price range. 2005 & 2006 Acura MDX A luxury SUV, the MDX is spacious, seats seven, and boasts distinctive styling and Acura's famed attention to detail. Plus, it packs some punch under the hood -- this generation was powered by 3.5-liter, 253-hp V6 matched to a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Acura Priced just right as a new vehicle, it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags, three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions. 2007 Acura RDX A crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess, the '07 RDX offered unibody construction, leather upholstery, heated front seats, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel, and the patented SH-AWD (SH for Super Handling) system. 2006 & 2007 Acura TL A mid-size, front-wheel-drive, four-door sedan powered by a 258-hp 3.2-liter V6, the Acura TL is a fine road machine. Actually, it was available for '06-'07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine, a 286-hp 3.5-liter. Depending on trim level, you can find it with a five-speed automatic with a console-mounted lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel. 2007 Audi A3 Audi designers have always shown a certain flair for dynamics, and that is evident here, in a sharply-engineered, handsomely-appointed vehicle that offers a fine balance between silky ride, nimble handling and zesty performance. This sporty compact was powered by a 200-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in '07, and came standard with a six-speed manual and an optional Direct Shift Gearbox. AOL Autos: Used Audi 2005 & 2006 BMW 3-Series The 3-Series is another winning stable of cars, but Consumer Reports especially liked specific model years/versions/features in the 3-Series family: The 2005 RWD coupe and convertible; the '06 325i RWD sedan; the '06 330i RWD sedan and the '05 Z4. Depending on the model year and version, the standard engine ranged from a 184-hp 2.5-L to a 255-hp 3.0-L. AOL Autos: Used BMW 2005 & 2006 Infiniti FX35 Another of the many crossovers that have hit the market the last several years, the FX35 is one of the sportier editions. During these model years, the FX35 2WD came with a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel-drive was standard, but AWD was also an option. Some spiffier features included leather seating surfaces, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control with microfiltration and steering-wheel controls. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti Infiniti G35 The G35 is one of the more svelte sports-sedan beauties on the road, offering Infiniti's typical attention to detail and sporting attitude. Yes, it has four doors, but it handles like a sporty coupe, with its power coming from a finely-tuned 3.5-liter V6. Horsepower output is 280 for the automatic and 298 with the manual. Luxo amenities include leather upholstery, automatic climate control, steering wheel audio controls, illuminated visor vanity mirrors and high-intensity discharge (HID) xenon headlamps. Lexus Any luxury-car aficionado knows that a Lexus is one of the most exquisitely-designed, high-performing chariots on the luxury-car market, and CR saw fit to include more than a half-dozen Lexus models on this list of recommended used luxury cars -- from the '02 SC and LX models, to the '03-'04 GX edition, '03 LS, '04 / '06 IS entries, '04-'05 RX model, '05 GS and '06 ES to ... well, you get the picture. Bottom line, given the Lexus reputation for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability, it's hard to go wrong with any of the above-named Lexus entries. And all have plenty of engine oomph and luxo-line amenities. AOL Autos: Used Lexus 2007 Lincoln MKX This luxury crossover vehicle debuted in '07 as a replacement for the Aviator, and made a big splash. A higher-end and pricier version of the Ford Edge, it seats five and is powered by a 265 hp 3.5-liter V-6 and comes with standard six-speed automatic tranny. Either FWD or AWD is available. One cool option was the glass-paneled roof dubbed the "Vista Roof." 2007 Lincoln MKZ Also new for the '07 model year, this handsome and fully-loaded mid-size luxury sedan replaced the Zephyr. Under the hood purrs a muscular 263-hp V6 hitched to a six-speed automatic transmission. FWD is standard, but AWD is optional. Standard safety features include side-impact air bags in the front; curtain-style head protection airbags for all outboard positions; plus traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution. 2007 Lincoln Town Car A venerated luxury car whose heritage goes way back, the Town Car still "has game" -- and is a far cry from the floaty boats your granddad drove in the '70s and '80s. It's still cavernous inside, but now boasts a much more refined design. It seats six comfortably and is powered by a 239-hp 4.6-liter V-8 that's linked to a four-speed automatic. The well-appointed cabin is trimmed in premium leather and burl walnut appliques. Available in Signature, Signature Limited, Designer and Signature L trim levels, you can find one to fit any taste. 1998 Porsche 911 No, your eyes don't deceive you -- CR did include a primo, high-line vehicle like a Porsche 911 on its list of recommended used cars under $30,000. But, take note: This is the 1998 edition. But when you're dealing with quality of this level, even an 10-year-old vehicle has a lot of juice left in it. So, by "going vintage," driving enthusiasts can get into their car of their dreams without breaking the bank. In '98, the 911 was powered by a 3.6L H-6 282 hp engine. So, while it wasn't quite the road-burner it is today, is still packed plenty of thrust. 2007 Volvo S60 (FWD) Only a year old, the '07 used edition should still be in fine condition, and it boasts top-drawer performance, stylish design and Volvo's all-world safety features. The '07 S60 came in several trim levels, with an array of engine sizes, from the turbocharged 2.5-liter 208 hp job to the 2.3-liter 257-hp inline five-cylinder plant to the 2.5-liter high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine that churned out 300 ponies. Depending on the trim line, either a manual or automatic transmission can be had. 2006 & 2007 Volvo XC70 The XC70 is a crossover vehicle, splitting the difference between an SUV and a wagon. And it's one of the finest crossovers on the road. It's all-wheel drive, and the latest used-model-year, the '07, was powered by a 208-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched to a Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission that also offers manual gear selection.
The Israel Defense Forces called off a raid after one of its combat soldiers posted information about the operation, including the time and place, on Facebook, the IDF said Wednesday. "On Wednesday, we are cleaning up (the village). Today - arrest. On Thursday, God willing, we will be home," the soldier, who was not identified, posted on the social networking site, according to IDF. The post was removed after other soldiers in the company saw it online and reported it to their commanders, IDF said. "The division commander decided to cancel the operation out of concern that the information had reached hostile groups and would harm IDF forces," it said. The soldier was sentenced to 10 days imprisonment and was removed from his battalion and all combat postings, IDF said. His combat certificate also was revoked. IDF soldiers are prohibited from posting classified information online, including photographs of military interests.
or until scientists find a cure for HIV. "Certainly, this is a disappointing turn of events for this young child, the medical staff involved in the child's care, and the HIV/AIDS research community," NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a statement. "Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body." Despite the setback, researchers are optimistic about using this early treatment method on infants infected with HIV. A clinical trial aimed at studying the effect will be amended to include this new information, they said, before it begins recruiting participants. "We´ve always known that the search for an HIV cure wasn't going to be easy," Françoise Barre-Sinoussi, president of the International AIDS Society, said in a statement. "Cases like this are hugely important for informing researchers on where to focus their efforts." Current treatment methods Researchers have long known that treating HIV-positive mothers while they are pregnant is important for the health of the child because they pass antibodies on to their babies that can protect them from disease. All HIV-positive moms will pass on those antibodies, but only 30% will transmit the actual virus, said Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay. And HIV-positive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2% of cases. "So all babies are born antibody-positive, but only a fraction of babies born to HIV-positive women will actually get the virus, and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis (preventive treatment) or not." Newborns are considered high-risk if their mothers' HIV infections are not under control or if the mothers are found to be HIV-positive when they're close to delivering. Usually, these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventive doses for six weeks to prevent infection, then start antiretroviral therapy, or ART, if HIV is diagnosed. ART is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease. But they do not kill the virus. In March, doctors announced that another child born with HIV appeared to be free of the virus after receiving similar treatment to the Mississippi baby. The case report was presented at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston. The girl was delivered at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, California, last summer to a mother with HIV who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. Doctors gave the baby high doses of three drugs -- AZT, 3TC and Nevirapine -- four hours after birth. Eleven days later, the virus was undetectable in her body and remained undetectable eight months later. "Taking kids off antiretroviral therapy intentionally is not standard of care," said Dr. Deborah Persaud at the time, a virologist with Johns Hopkins Children's Center who has been involved in both cases. On Thursday Persaud said the California baby is still on antiretroviral treatment and doing well, said Persaud. "At this time, there is no plan to stop treatment."

The shelling and sinking of a rust-stained fishing trawler in Alaskan waters ends its aimless voyage more than a year after a tsunami swept it off the east coast of Japan. The U.S. Coast Guard said it opened fire on the roughly 200-foot trawler Thursday after it determined the "unmanned, unlit, unmarked vessel" posed a hazard to mariners and Alaska's marine environment. The Ryou-Un Maru caught fire and capsized in more than 6,000 feet of water about 180 miles southwest of the port city of Sitka, said Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley, a Coast Guard spokesman. It was a dramatic end for the Japanese squid trawler. It was bound for a scrap yard before becoming part of a giant debris field generated by a tsunami that struck the island nation following a 9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011. "It's really one of the first significant pieces of tsunami debris to make its way across the Pacific Ocean," Mosley said. The ship drifted undetected until late last month when a Canadian coastal air patrol spotted it several hundred miles off the Queen Charlotte Islands, an archipelago on the north coast of British Columbia. It captured the imagination of the public, which followed the final days of "the ghost ship" in media reports and tracked its progress on Canadian and U.S. Coast Guard websites. "I think it captured a lot of people because it survived. It was swept away by the tsunami. It's believed lost. It's forgotten about. And it spends an entire year at sea, a summer, a winter and it makes it all the way across the Pacific Ocean," Mosley said. The Japan coast guard identified the trawler and its owner after Canadian officials provided the identification number on the hull of the ship. It was moored at Hachinohe in the Aomori prefecture when the tsunami hit last year. The ship drifted into U.S. waters over the weekend, traveling about a mile per hour and making its way toward the rich fishing waters of the Gulf of Alaska, Mosley said. At that point, the U.S. Coast Guard determined it posed a threat to other ships navigating the area as well as a potential environment hazard, he said. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advised the Coast Guard where the ship's sinking would have the least environmental impact. "The potential for a pollution incident is unknown at this time, but officials have limited concerns about any biological threats due to the length of time the vessel has been at sea," the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Coast Guard has been continuously broadcasting the vessel's location to mariners. It will continue the warnings through Friday morning until it conducts an aerial survey to determine its sinking left behind no potentially hazardous debris, Mosley said. The trawler's planned sinking was temporarily halted Thursday morning when the Coast Guard ship, the Anacapa, based out of Petersburg, Alaska, arrived to find a Canadian ship inspecting the trawler. "They wanted to claim the vessel for salvage," Mosley said. "At that point, there was a meeting to discuss whether they had the means to tow or salvage the vessel," he said. "They determined it would be too unsafe. At that point, they were asked to leave the area." The Anacapa opened fire Thursday afternoon with its 25 mm cannons, blowing holes into the side of the Ryou-Un Maru, the Coast Guard said. It took more than four hours for the trawler to sink. CNN's Leslie Tripp, Tina Burnside, Jake Carpenter, Jack Maddox and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.
For years, Germany has been feted as the strong man of Europe: While those around it battled years of boom-and-bust, Germany, stable and consistent, thrived. Its economy -- and the economic management of its leaders -- was frequently cited as an example to the rest of the world. But in recent years, that very stability has come to threaten the country, by forcing it to take a leading role in the bailouts of its less economically healthy neighbors, pledging to protect them from sinking under the weight of their debts. Despite being seen as vital for the survival of the euro, Germany's actions have been greeted with anger and frustration at home. A Bloomberg/YouGov poll published on Tuesday found that just 15% of Germans questioned approved of their government's performance during the euro crisis, while 75% disapproved. Concern about what the bailouts will mean for the eurozone has proved contagious, tarnishing not just the economies, but the individuals involved -- and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is no exception. Merkel and Sarkozy huddle as euro struggles Frequently dubbed Germany's "Iron Lady" and hailed as the country's answer to former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the euro crisis has now left Merkel's image looking decidedly rusty. Merkel, 57, the daughter of a Protestant minister, was brought up in then-Communist East Germany. She trained as a chemist before turning to politics as a member of the conservative, right-wing Christian Democrats (CDU). She was elected as chancellor -- the first woman to hold the post -- in 2005, 15 years after she entered parliament. She was re-elected in 2009, but recent polls suggest she may struggle to secure a third term. A survey by German television channel ARD earlier this month recorded a drop in Merkel's approval ratings -- just 45% of those polled said they were satisfied with her work, a slide of four points compared with the previous month. The same poll appeared to predict a grim future for Merkel's CDU/CSU, with support for the party slipping to 36%, compared to the 51% who backed likely coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party and the Greens. And there was further bad news for Merkel, with her coalition partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), notching up just 4% support in the survey -- a result that, were it to be repeated in real elections, would see them fall below the minimum vote threshold, and lose their place in parliament. The FDP has already threatened to withdraw their support for the coalition if Merkel and the CDU back controversial euro bonds as a potential solution to the European debt crisis -- a move that could bring down the government. In March this year, the CDU lost control of the prosperous southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg, which it had governed ever since the 1950s. And with more elections to come later this year, in Berlin and the northern state of Mecklenberg-Western Pomerania, many CDU members fear the euro crisis could yet do further damage to the party -- and its embattled leader. As Germany's conservative Die Welt newspaper recently pointed out in an editorial, "it is possible the next election may even hinge on this issue." "For Merkel, it is both a curse and a blessing. Like her one-time mentor Helmut Kohl, it would provide her the chance to go down in history as a great European. At the same time, she runs the risk of what happened to her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder. [Who] did the right thing economically -- but was then voted out of office." The latest financial figures mean Merkel and her party can no longer rely on the strength of the economy to see them through. On Tuesday, Germany announced its GDP for the second quarter of 2011 had virtually flatlined, growing by just 0.1% (compared to 1.3% growth in the first quarter of the year). German slowdown adds to eurozone crisis There may be trouble ahead for Merkel, and for Germany as a whole, but the country's years of stability should allow it to weather the storm more easily than some of its neighbors. And while the euro crisis has dented the chancellor's image, the Bloomberg/YouGov poll suggests that most German hostility over the situation is directed towards Greece. Of those Germans questioned in the survey, 59% were firmly opposed to further bailouts (with just 20% supporting them), and 58% backed the idea of booting Greece out of the eurozone.
The attorney representing two men suing John Travolta for alleged groping apologized Friday to Travolta's attorney for how one of the plaintiffs was wrong about the date of one alleged attack. That plaintiff, identified as John Doe No. 1, will remain in the federal lawsuit but will be represented by a different lawyer, attorney Okorie Okorocha told CNN. Travolta's attorney, Martin Singer, has said the actor denies the lawsuit's allegations that he groped two massage therapists while on their massage tables. The suit seeks $2 million in damages for each plaintiff. "I want to apologize to Martin Singer. It must be very upsetting," Okorocha told CNN about how John Doe No. 1 provided the wrong date of January 16 for an alleged groping incident in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. "I believed I was on solid ground or I wouldn't have given the dates on any court papers or to Mr. Singer," said Okorocha, an attorney based in Pasadena, California. John Doe No. 1 "needs a fresh lawyer to handle the case and we're working on that," Okorocha said. "He needs someone to handle the case who hasn't made any mistakes." The current petition will be amended once the new lawyer is hired for John Doe No. 1, and that lawyer would rewrite the section relating to that client, Okorocha said. John Doe No. 2 will still be represented by Okorocha and remain on the same lawsuit, the attorney said. This week, Travolta's lawyer argued a time-stamped photograph and a restaurant receipt show the actor was not in Los Angeles when John Doe No. 1 claimed the actor assaulted him. The plaintiffs are identified in court filings only as John Doe No. 1 from Texas and John Doe No. 2 of Atlanta, a move their lawyer says is allowed by federal law to protect victims. Travolta's lawyers know their names, Okorocha said. Singer said that Okorocha filed his clients anonymously to keep other people from recognizing them and coming forward with evidence against them. Travolta, 58, has been married to actress Kelly Preston for 20 years. The oldest of their three children, Jett, was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas in January 2009. Okorocha said much of his practice is focused on going after sexual predators. He said he is not intimidated by the prospect of going against Singer, a veteran lawyer known for aggressive tactics in his representation of "A-list" Hollywood clients. But Singer came out swinging against Okorocha this week, first questioning the suit's detailed description of the first incident in which Travolta allegedly groped John Doe No. 1 repeatedly and finally masturbated during the two-hour massage session in the Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow. The suit claimed Travolta picked up the plaintiff in a black Lexus SUV and took him to a hotel bungalow where an African-American chef was cooking hamburgers. But Singer said that Travolta "doesn't have a black chef, doesn't own an SUV or a Lexus. He drives a sedan." And Travolta was in New York that day to be fitted for his wardrobe for his film "Killing Seasons," Singer said. He arrived in the city on January 15, a day before the alleged assault in Beverly Hills, and remained there at least through the next day, he said. A photograph of Travolta, which Singer said was taken at the New York fitting, bears a digital timestamp of January 16 at 4:30 p.m., although the time zone was not specified. Singer also provided a receipt for a $382 meal at Mr. Chow, a Manhattan restaurant, apparently printed at 11:38 p.m. the same day of the alleged Beverly Hills assault. The merchant copy of the receipt does not include a signature. Earlier this week, Okorocha had stood by John Doe No. 1's account of the alleged January 16 assault. "My client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m.," Okorocha said this week. "I can get there on horseback to Mr. Chow's in New York in 12 hours. That's not that remarkable." He noted that Travolta is a licensed pilot with a private jet. The second plaintiff, who claims a similar encounter with Travolta occurred at an Atlanta hotel where he was a staff massage therapist on January 25, was added to the lawsuit Tuesday. Okorocha said the case should be easy to prove because of documentation that was done soon after the incident. "He tells his boss, the employees all talk about it. There's e-mails going back and forth about the incident." Responded Singer this week: "This second 'anonymous' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one." Singer said it was "obvious" that Okorocha "checked media reports that my client was in Atlanta working on a movie" before filing the second claim about an Atlanta incident, he said. "However, the claim by Doe No. 2 is just as fabricated as the claim by Doe No. 1," Singer said. "Our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims." Unless Travolta accepts an out-of-court settlement, the actor can expect to testify in public and on camera about the allegations, Okorocha said this week. "He's going to have a videotaped deposition with me asking him questions and if he goes to trial he is going be on the witness stand answering my questions," Okorocha said. "That is far more intensive and productive as far as evidence than any police report will ever be." The lawsuit alleges that Travolta called the first plaintiff, who advertises online with "professionally themed ads," to arrange for a massage at $200 an hour. Travolta picked him up at a Beverly Hills address and drove him to the hotel, according to the lawsuit. When they entered the bungalow, Travolta "shamelessly stripped naked" in front of a professional chef and the plaintiff, the lawsuit states. "For the first hour the massage was without incident, other than he kept purposefully sliding the towel down that covered his buttocks to reveal about half of gluteus area," the suit states. The massage therapist repeatedly slid the towel back up 10 times in the first hour, "reminding Defendant that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage," the suit states. When Travolta "started to rub Plaintiff's leg," he "thought it was accidental," it said. Later, however, there was more touching by Travolta "and this time Plaintiff told Defendant to please not touch him again," the complaint said. "Defendant apologized, but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child," it said. The lawsuit then described Travolta allegedly touching and grabbing the massage therapist's penis. "This was painful and uncomfortable," the suit said. Travolta apologized and suggested they "must have gotten our signals crossed," and that he thought that the massage therapist "wanted the same thing he did," it said. "Defendant then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding." Travolta then asked him to switch places on the table for a "reverse massage," the lawsuit states. Travolta allegedly offered to perform a sexual act on the therapist. Although the therapist "felt very afraid for his safety," he agreed to stay and continue with the massage after Travolta told him "OK, I'll behave myself," the suit said. Travolta's statement "gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control," the suit said. When he resumed with a deep tissue massage on his shoulders, Travolta told him, "Say something nice to me," it said. Travolta, who allegedly began masturbating, then got up and screamed at the plaintiff "how selfish he was; that Defendant got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his 'Welcome Back Kotter' days," the suit said. Hollywood is controlled by homosexual men "who expect favors in return for sexual activity," the lawsuit document quotes Travolta as saying. "Defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up," it said. The complaint said Travolta told the therapist that "he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it." When the therapist refused to take part, Travolta said, "No problem. I will find new friends," the suit said. He then offered to call a "Hollywood starlet" who wanted "three-way sex," but "they needed to have sex together first before calling her, so this way they would be in-sync with each other sexually," the suit said. The actor told him he could "make millions and be famous" if he lost some weight and adapted to same-sex relations, the suit said. When the therapist threatened to call police if he was not returned to where he was picked up, Travolta drove him back, although calling him "selfish" and a "loser" on the way, it said. He paid the therapist $800, double the $400 owed for the two hours, the suit said. CNN's Carolyn Sung and Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.
After years of struggling with depression, Nikki de Toledo killed herself with a prescription drug overdose when she was 27. She didn't leave a suicide note, but she did leave her 8-year-old son, Kevin. Kevin's grandparents, Ginette and AndrÃ© de Toledo, immediately took over custody, because Kevin's father lived abroad and had never been a part of his life. It wasn't an easy transition, though. "It was a very difficult time for my parents because they weren't able to grieve," said Nikki's sister, Sylvie. "They were immediately responsible for raising an 8-year-old who also was grieving in his own way. And it was different than the way my parents were grieving. It was a pretty tough time for our family." It's often the grandparents who step up when a parent dies or is unable to take care of a child for other reasons, such as incarceration, abuse or mental illness. In 2011, there were at least 2.7 million grandparents raising a grandchild in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. But the sudden shift in responsibility can be incredibly stressful. Grandparents may be living on fixed incomes, and the additional dependents can cause costs to soar. There's also an emotional adjustment when an empty nest is no longer empty. "When that call comes ... your whole life changes," Sylvie de Toledo said. "It's turned inside out and upside down." De Toledo said she watched her parents, then in their mid-50s, struggle with their new responsibilities. It affected their marriage and their health. Also, like many children who lose a parent, Kevin had emotional issues that followed him into his teenage years. "Kevin was a difficult teenager," said de Toledo, a 58-year-old social worker. "The trauma and grief and loss of a parent abandoning you, so to speak ... it's a huge, huge loss." Around the same time, de Toledo started noticing more of her work clients -- children and grandparents -- dealing with similar challenges. "The most common thread was that they all felt alone and isolated," she said. "They didn't know anyone in the same situation that they were in." Determined to bring some of these families together, de Toledo began holding a support group for about 10 of them. When attendance began to skyrocket, she started her own nonprofit, Grandparents as Parents, to help more people cope with the process. Today, more than a quarter-century later, there are 20 support groups across Los Angeles, and the nonprofit works with more than 3,000 families a year, providing them with financial assistance, legal advice and emotional support. More than 90% of the caregivers are grandparents, but the nonprofit also assists aunts, uncles, siblings and close friends who have stepped up to care for children when their biological parents can't. "We are a one-stop shop for relative caregivers," de Toledo said. "So many times, the families are completely overwhelmed. The kids come to them with a dirty diaper and a T-shirt that's way too big for them." Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes When someone calls for help, de Toledo is usually the first person they talk to. She listens to their story and then helps them prioritize their needs so the situation isn't so overwhelming. "It's sort of like a jigsaw puzzle," she said. "You have to figure out how to put the pieces back together to build a whole, happy, healthy individual child." Lourdes Aguylar called seven years ago when her daughter dropped off three children ages 3, 9, and 10 months. Aguylar received immediate assistance -- food, toys and clothes -- and with the group's help she later became legal guardian of the children. Over the years, the group has also helped provide the children with psychological, educational and medical support. But perhaps most importantly, Aguylar said, they have become part of a larger family -- a group of caregivers and children who back each other. "You know you're not the only one," she said. More on CNN: Grandparents get tech-savvy to keep in touch In addition to weekly support groups, there are monthly picnics for families and friends as well as opportunities for the families to attend events together, such as the theater, amusement parks and sporting events. The nonprofit gets its money through grants, private donations and corporate sponsors, but it also helps grandparents apply for government assistance. de Toledo said many grandparents don't realize there are special programs that may be available to them. "We have seen countless families who have maxed out credit cards and used all of their savings before they even ask for help," she said. Even if they do know there is help out there, many don't know how to navigate the system and may need help using online systems or filling out paperwork. So de Toledo and her staff or volunteers will walk them through the process. Louise Reaves, 60, got in touch with de Toledo to help her navigate the court system and get custody and benefits for her young granddaughter. Six years ago, Reaves' daughter dropped the baby off at her house, promising to return when she got back on her feet; she hasn't come back. "Sylvie was able to walk me through everything that I needed," Reaves said. "I was able to get medical assistance for (my granddaughter). I was able to get clothing for her ... rent. They helped me get on my feet where I could help myself." She credits the group with keeping her family together. "Without me joining (the group), I don't know where we would be," she said. "I'm going to be honest with you. I don't know if (my granddaughter) would be in a group home or a foster home or what. It was rough." More on CNN: Caregiver lives rerouted, enriched by aging parents De Toledo said her group has kept thousands of children from entering the foster care system, and they've also kept siblings from being separated. "We've literally saved families," she said. But the true heroes, she said, are the caregivers. "It's really the grandparents and the relatives who are doing this that deserve the recognition for putting their own lives on hold," she said. "I just was able to plant a seed with something that happened in my own family. ... "From a family tragedy, something wonderful has happened." Want to get involved?

"My mother says I will make a name for myself." Shweta Katti sings lyrics from a popular Bollywood song that has special meaning to her. Growing up in Mumbai's largest red-light district, in a makeshift room above a brothel, Katti often found it difficult to study and stay focused on her future. "I was young. I didn't know how to deal with the situation," said Katti, now 18. "There were men who used to ask me, 'Do you want to sleep with me?' " Katti says she was sexually abused around age 11 or 12. It was hard to imagine a way out. But with inspiration from her mother and help from a local charity, Katti is now much more optimistic. She won a scholarship to Bard College in New York, and she is set to enroll this fall. "I don't know what I'm going to find out there, but I'm really excited," Katti told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. "This is going to be an adventure for me: a new place, new people, new culture." Katti's unlikely journey has received global attention. Newsweek recently named her one of 25 women to watch under age 25. It would not have been possible without the help of Kranti, a charity that is empowering girls from Mumbai's red-light districts. "Everyone looks at these girls like, 'Poor them, they're victims, they're just going to suffer and have such terrible lives,' " said Kranti founder Robin Chaurasiya. "But the fact is that people who go through all of these situations and experience these hardships I personally believe are going to make the most amazing leaders." Katti credits her mother, Vandana, for encouraging her move to Kranti, which means "revolution" in Hindi. "My mom is my inspiration, and she's the one who encouraged me and who said, 'You're going to do better, you are amazing,' " Katti said. "And of course the sex workers whom I was surrounded by, because my mom used to go to factory at like 9 in the morning and she used to come back at 7. I used to spend most of my time with them. ... Because of my mom and because of them, I'm here." Katti's mother said she was forced to raise her children above a brothel because it was all she could afford. But she always dreamed of something better. "From the time my daughter was born, I wanted her to read and write," she said. "I didn't want her to endure what I did." Katti said she now wants to study psychology so she can help other women back home. She hopes her story will inspire others in the red-light district to dream big. "Every girl has it in herself. ... If given a chance, everybody can do this," she said. "This is not like a supernatural thing in me, but I got the opportunity, I got this chance."

Major League Baseball on Friday sued a South Florida clinic Biogenesis of America and several men associated with it for flouting its drug prevention program by allegedly providing performance enhancing substances to players, the pro sports league said. According to reports and the MLB suit, filed in Florida's Miami-Dade County, the clinic reportedly supplied banned performance enhancing substances to a number of current and former pro baseball players such as ex-Boston Red Sox Manny Ramirez. "We believe we have a legitimate legal claim against the defendants, and we intend to pursue it vigorously," said Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball's executive vice president of economics and legal affairs. A phone call placed Friday night by CNN to Bosch's lawyer was not immediately returned. Previously, CNN has been unable to reach those involved in the clinic. And after the New Times story broke, a CNN crew went to the Coral Gables, Florida, address of the Biogenesis clinic and found its offices vacant. A-Rod denies performance-enhancing drugs reports The 14-page complaint names Biogenesis, its predecessor and six individuals -- among them its program director Anthony Bosch, others at the company, someone who worked at a sports agency, a former University of Miami baseball player and a "self-proclaimed chemist" who supplied substances. The accused, according to Major League Baseball, solicited players, supplied them with drugs and offered dosage recommendations in order not to test positive for banned substances under the league's program. "(The defendants) knowingly and intentionally caused and/or induced ... players to breach their contractual obligations under MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program," the complaint said. The complaint did not specify how much money it is seeking, beyond that it's more than $15,000. But it insists the league rightfully deserves to be paid given what BioGenesis and its affiliates have done to the sport. "MLB has suffered damages, including the costs of (the) investigation, loss of goodwill, loss of revenue and profits and injury to its reputation, image, strategic advantage and fan relationships," the league alleges in its complaint. After a surge in home runs in the late 1980s and 1990s -- highlighted by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa racing to break Roger Maris's single-season home run record in 1998, followed three years later by Barry Bonds breaking the new record -- Major League Baseball came under a cloud amid allegations it hadn't done enough to recognize, and combat, the use of performance enhancing substances. The league, in conjunction with its players' union, in recent years has beefed up its drug testing programs and penalties. A number of top-level and minor league players have been suspended as a result, like Ramirez who was suspended 50 games in 2009. Biogenesis became part of this story publicly in late January, when the Miami New Times reported that more than a dozen professional baseball players and other athletes were named in records kept over several years by the clinic. CNN was unable to independently obtain the documents the newspaper said it based its reporting on. And New Times reported earlier this month that it refused Major League Baseball's request for records that contributed to its story. One of those players named by the publication is Alex Rodriguez, a 37-year-old New York Yankee who ranks fifth in home runs in major league history. Shortly after the New Times article came out, ESPN.com published a story quoting unidentified sources as describing how Bosch allegedly went to Rodriguez's waterfront Florida mansion when summoned and injected the star player with performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs. Rodriguez's camp subsequently released a statement denying any connection to the Biogenesis' clinic's owner while disputing the aforementioned reports. "The purported documents referenced in the story -- at least as they relate to Alex Rodriguez -- are not legitimate," the player's public relations agent said.
Italy's Valentino Rossi gave his bid to seal a seventh Moto GP world title at the Malaysian Grand Prix a boost after qualifying for the race in pole position. The defending champion set a name lap-record time of 2 minutes 00.518 seconds despite sweltering conditions on Saturday. The time smashed Casey Stoner's 2007 lap record of 2 minutes 02.108 seconds. The Yamaha rider celebrated his seventh pole of the season by pulling a wheelie as he drove into the pit lane at the Sepang circuit. The 5.5-kilometer track that is situated south of the capital Kuala Lumpur, is a notoriously tought test for rider and machine alike with its combination of tight corners, long straights and tough high-speed bends. The 30-year-old currently leads the world championship by 38 points, a position that means a top-four finish at Sepang would seal the title on Sunday. Rossi's teammate Jorge Lorenzo qualified in second place, just 0.569sec behind -- a result that prompted Rossi to pay tribute to the hard work of his team. "The team worked well, the bike performed well, hence I was able to go faster. "Starting from pole is important since the (first) corner is far away," he added. Spaniard Dani Pedrosa (Honda) was 0.736sec behind Rossi while Australian Stoner was fourth at 0.937sec. Ducati rider Stoner, who finished ahead of Rossi in last weekend's Australian Grand Prix to take the win, is third in the world championship standings, with Pedrosa fourth on a Honda.
including 1,500 additional National Guard troops -- prepared to stop the looting and fires that followed a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in August. "The frustrations that we've seen are not just about a particular incident," he said. "They have deep roots in many communities of color who have a sense that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly or fairly. That may not be true everywhere and it's certainly not true for the vast majority of law enforcement officials, but that's an impression that folks have and it's not just made up -- it's rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time." RELATED: King to Obama: Invite Wilson to White House He said Monday night's protests were "overwhelmingly peaceful," but said some of the images from Ferguson -- including police cars being destroyed and businesses looted -- shouldn't be tolerated. "There are productive ways of responding and expressing those frustrations, and there are destructive ways of responding," Obama said. "Burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk -- that's destructive and there's no excuse for it. Those are criminal acts. And people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts." The President's comments came at the beginning of a speech that was focused on immigration. He said he wouldn't comment on the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Brown. But Obama said better police training, law enforcement forces that are representative of the communities they serve and more "makes a difference." He promised regional meetings focused on "building trust in our communities" between police and residents, and vowed to work with protesters who want to make political changes. "For the overwhelming majority of people who just feel frustrated and pained because they get a sense that maybe some communities aren't treated fairly or some individuals aren't seen as as worthy as others, I understand that and I want to work with you," he said. Obama tackles immigration, Ferguson at hometown rally Obama echoed Attorney General Eric Holder, who said Tuesday afternoon that peaceful and non-violent protests have a history of forcing change in the United States, and called it "heartening" that some leaders of the protests tried to stop the violence that broke out Monday night. "I really embrace those who have been proactively intervening to stop acts of violence within their midst and I encourage them to continue exercising this important leadership. I know this is not an easy thing to do," Holder said. The Justice Department has launched civil rights investigations into both the Brown shooting and the Ferguson Police Department's relations with minorities. Officials from the department have been in the area since August working to ease tensions between protesters and police and offering training to local law enforcement. Amid concerns about a second night of violence, Holder said the Justice Department remains in contact with leaders of the protests. He also said the department will conduct a review in the wake of Monday night "so that we can develop strategies for identifying and isolating the criminal elements from peaceful protestors." RELATED: 9 moments that capture the chaos in Ferguson Before departing the White House for Chicago, Obama was briefed by Holder on both the situation in Ferguson and longer-term efforts to improve relations between citizens and police, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Top Obama aide Valerie Jarrett spoke twice -- Monday night and Tuesday morning -- with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, and has also briefed Obama. Jarrett and Holder also held a conference call with civil rights leaders. Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson, meanwhile, held a call with Missouri officials to coordinate their response in Ferguson, while White House staffers discussed other cities' responses with mayors across the country. After a St. Louis County prosecutor announced that the grand jury had decided against indicting Officer Darren Wilson on Monday night, Obama said protesters' anger is "understandable" but urged them to remain peaceful. As he spoke, though, some of the hundreds in the streets of Ferguson had looted local stores, destroyed police cruisers and set fires -- and police responded by firing tear gas into crowds. "I think the images that were captured last night were all the more reason the President felt compelled to go out and speak and urge calm," Schultz said. Obama deflected a question about whether he would visit Ferguson. Asked on Tuesday about travel to the area, Schultz said Obama would decide once "things calm down a little bit."

All in-bound cargo on commercial flights from Europe, the Middle East and Africa -- and quite possibly other areas of the world -- is being screened twice, as a result of the recent terror threats that have closed U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa, according to a cargo industry official. The Department of Homeland Security late last week ordered airlines to increase the inspection of cargo at the last point of departure for the United States, said Brandon Fried, the executive director of Airforwarders Association, a trade group. "They said, 'until further notice, this is what you're going to do,'" Fried said. "Nothing unscreened gets on the plane," Fried said. "Basically they said, 'If you used one method, or several methods (of inspecting cargo), you need to do it again.' It's redundant, dual screening." TSA expanding program to speed security lines "So now the freight is doubly secure," he said. The U.S. beefed up screening after discovering two toner cartridges packed with plastic explosives on board two aircraft bound for the U.S. in October 2010. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took responsibility for the plot. AQAP is involved in the communications leading to the most recent warnings that have closed U.S. facilities, U.S. officials say. Department of Homeland Security officials have declined to say what, if any, security measures have been taken as the result of the recent worldwide terror alert. Travelers must 'say something' In a statement released to the media, a DHS official said: "As always, our security posture, which at all times includes a number of measures both seen and unseen, will continue to respond appropriately to protect the American people from an ever evolving threat picture." Privately, officials say that even in the absence of specific intelligence, it is prudent to increase security in the United States, especially given AQAP's past deeds. Fried said the increased screening has resulted in some backlogs and delays, especially as some airlines have sought to clarify the rules. "We're in August, so it's not the busiest time of year," he said. "Our membership has reported sporadic delays." The impact would have been more severe had the change occurred during busier shipping seasons, he said. Skyjacked: A nation with no airline security
from 300,000 to 150,000. Part of the problem, some analysts say, is the price. Although the iPhone 5C starts at $99 with a mobile data plan, many had predicted that it would need to be even cheaper to appeal to buyers in emerging markets like China and India. In China, where phones aren't subsidized by mobile carriers, the 5C is selling for 3,500 yuan, or about $560. And though its style is all new, the 5C doesn't sport features significantly upgraded from the iPhone 5, which can be  had for as low as $199. The two-year-old iPhone 4S can be had for free with a data plan. Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research, says that selling the more expensive 5S, which starts at $199, is good for Apple's bottom line in the short term. "But in the longer term," she said, "it's bad news. "Apple needs new customers to keep growing, and the 5C was supposed to appeal to a new, more price-conscious consumer," she said. "Turns out that acquisition is a lot harder than retention." Some retailers have responded by slashing prices on the 5C. This month, Best Buy ran a promotion offering the phone for $50. Walmart has discounted it to $45 through the holidays, and Radio Shack is giving customers who buy one $50 gift cards through early next month. But some say it's not quite time to write the phone's obituary. "Rumours on order cuts (or increases) from parts of Apple's supply chain tell us absolutely nothing either way," Benedict Evans, an independent analyst, wrote recently on Twitter. "Too many moving parts." In another post, he made light of people comparing iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C sales as an indicator of Apple's success. "iPhone 5S outselling 5C? Apple's growth strategy a failure. Sell!" he wrote. "iPhone 5C outselling 5S? Cannibalisation and (revenue per user) collapse. Sell!" This year, Apple CEO Tim Cook himself downplayed the amount of weight observers should place in supply-chain rumors. "I suggest it's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans," Cook said during an earnings call. "The supply chain is very complex, and we have multiple sources for things. ... There is an inordinate long list of things that can make any single data point not a great proxy for what is going on." And there is something to be said for your top-end phone leading the way. The iPhone 5S has hit the streets to almost universally high marks from both reviewers and users. Apple announced last month that first-weekend sales of both phones combined topped 9 million, a record for the company. Still, Apple does nothing accidentally. The iPhone 5C clearly was released to appeal to customers in a way that the iPhone 5S couldn't. Only time will tell whether Apple will succeed, but it will need to see improvements before it does. "Apple has more work to do to attract the next generation of iPhone customers," Epps said. "The 5C isn't resonating as Apple hoped it would."
including Britain's Prince Andrew -- while a teenager, an allegation the Duke of York's camp firmly denies. A royal family spokesman in London labeled the accusation against Prince Andrew "categorically untrue." The woman made the allegation in a civil motion filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. Both are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the U.S. government to take a fresh look at its case involving self-made billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation. The investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18-month sentence in 2008, said The New York Times. According to The Times and the Washington Post, Epstein was the subject of a federal investigation but a deal allowed him to plead guilty to the lesser state charge and avoid a potential federal case. The four women allege their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated because the U.S. "government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement" with Epstein. According to the new court filing, the women contend they were not properly informed by the government about the ongoing status of a possible federal prosecution. It also claims Epstein used "powerful political and social connections to secure a favorable plea deal." Tuesday's filing claims the two new alleged victims were sexually abused and exploited by Epstein, one beginning when she was 15 and the other when she was 16. One of them, referred to as Jane Doe #3 in the document, claims that an accomplice who Epstein "used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities" approached her in 1999. That alleged female accomplice allegedly "regularly participated in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors" and assisted Epstein as he made Jane Doe #3 into a "sex slave" from 1999 to 2002, the filing says. The court filing makes claims against others allegedly involved "in Epstein's sexual abuse ring," saying, "Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to politically-connected and financially-powerful people." Prince Andrew was one of those named, with the filing claiming that Jane Doe #3 "was forced to have sexual relations with him when she was a minor" in London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. A palace spokesman, who is not named per custom, pointed out Friday that Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, is not a direct party to the "ongoing civil proceedings in the United States." Andrew is a son of Queen Elizabeth II and a brother of Prince Charles, the next in line for the British throne. "As such we would not comment on the detail," the palace spokesman said. "However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue." Also accused in the court filing this week of sexually abusing Jane Doe #3 was noted law professor Alan Dershowitz. "Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands," the filing states. Dershowitz issued an adamant denial, saying the case "is all about money." "The entire story is completely made up," Dershowitz said in the statement. "I have challenged her lawyers for her to repeat these statements in public so that I can sue them for defamation and I have challenged her to file criminal charges against me, because the filing of false criminal charges, which this one is,  is a serious crime," he added. A lawyer for Epstein also dismissed the allegations. "These are stale, rehashed allegations that lawyers are now attempting to repackage and spice up by adding the names of prominent people," said Epstein's attorney, Jack Goldberger. "The allegations, which are outlandish on their face and discredited by the evidence, were made in a civil case in which Mr. Epstein is not a party." An attorney for the alleged victims, Brad Edwards, said  that he was "not able to comment beyond our pleadings at this point nor respond to any denials or threats by anyone." Through Edwards' office, Jane Doe #3 issued a statement saying she is "looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse. It appears that I am now being unjustly victimized again." CNN's Phil Gast, Mayra Cuevas and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.
A first-edition Harry Potter book was sold for about $19,000, according to an auction house in Dallas, Texas. Normal copies of the Harry Potter books go for under $20, unlike the autographed first edition that sold for $19,000. The soft-cover book was one of 200 copies printed and is a rarity compared with later editions of the popular series that were printed in the millions, the Heritage Auction Galleries said. The book, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," includes an autograph from author J.K. Rowling. It's the first book in the Harry Potter series and was published in the United States under the title "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." The auction had estimated that the 223-page book would sell for as much as $12,000. The winning bid of $19,120 bypassed expectations, but it was not the most expensive sale of Harry Potter-related items in an auction. Last year, an 800-word prequel to the blockbuster Harry Potter novel series fetched nearly $50,000 for a writer's group and dyslexia charity. That prequel was handwritten and signed by Rowling.
The uptick in attacks by Afghan security forces against coalition troops has hit home, with all troops at NATO headquarters and all bases across Afghanistan now ordered to carry loaded weapons around the clock, CNN learned Friday. Gen. John Allen, the NATO commander in Afghanistan, ordered the move, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the orders. The order, made in recent days, was divulged amid two more so-called green-on-blue or insider attacks Friday. An Afghan police officer opened fire on U.S. troops in Farah province in southwestern Afghanistan, killing two service members, the NATO-led command said. Two International Security Assistance Force troops and an Afghan service member were wounded by another Afghan service member in Kandahar province, in the south. The order comes as coalition forces adopt and study measures aimed at thwarting such attacks. In Afghan combat situations, all troops are armed.  But at other locations, only base security forces had been regularly armed. Those troops have been called into action when insurgents have launched attacks on the base. Coalition steps up fight against Afghan 'green-on-blue' attacks Now, anyone who goes to the base headquarters would see that all troops, regardless of their tasks, carry weapons with a magazine of ammunition attached, a U.S. official confirmed. Troops now could fire against an attacker within seconds by sliding a lever on their weapons to make a round drop into the firing chamber. Loaded weapons are being carried both in the open outdoor areas of the base and inside buildings and meeting rooms. Allen and his top commanders live and work at the Kabul NATO headquarters, attached to the U.S. Embassy. The Friday green-on-blue attacks follow a claim purportedly from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar that fighters are infiltrating Afghan security forces to attack NATO-led forces on their bases. "Many Afghans in the rank and files of the enemy have shown a willingness to help the (Taliban) in a shrewd manner," said a statement posted on militant websites Thursday and obtained by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the activities of militant groups on the Web. "As a result, the foreign invaders and their allies at their military centers and bases are suffering crushing blows by these heroic soldiers." CNN can't independently verify the authenticity of the statement, which was released in advance of this weekend's Eid al Fitr celebrations that mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The Taliban are known routinely to claim responsibility for attacks and inflate casualty numbers. Omar also urged employees of the Afghan government to seek out the group's newly established "Call and Guidance, Luring and Integration" departments that have been established throughout the country "so that they may leave the enemy ranks and join the fighters," according to SITE. Omar's statement drew a sharp response from Allen, who accused the Taliban leader of issuing "an unmistakable message of death, hate and hopelessness for the Afghan people" on the eve of the Eid celebrations. "The pride of the Afghan people has been smeared by killers who pose as soldiers and police, yet they represent the worst of humanity," Allen said Friday. The commander accused of Omar of sending "young brainwashed men to carry out attacks in a fruitless cause," while he "rests comfortably from afar." "He professes love for his fighters, yet he sends them to their deaths by the hundreds. Where is the vision that Omar speaks of? Where is the love he professes for the Afghan people?" Allen said. "Are these not the acts of a deranged man who puts his own goals of personal domination ahead of the future of the Afghan people?" Shootings by Afghan forces take growing toll on NATO troops An estimated 101 NATO troops have been killed in green-on-blue attacks since May 2007 across the country, military analyst Bill Roggio said Friday. Roggio, managing editor of the Long War Journal blog, which reports and analyzes terror issues, said green-on-blue attacks have caused around 13% of coalition deaths this year. Of the green-on-blue attacks since 2007, about 40% of the deaths have occurred this year and 35% occurred last year, he said. Roggio said there was a flurry of insider attacks early in the year, then a lull, and now a flareup in recent days. Green-on-blue is military lingo, with green a reference to Afghan forces and blue to coalition troops. " 'Blue' is always the color of the friendly force, i.e. NATO/ISAF; 'Red' signifies the enemy force; and 'Green' is the indigenous force allied with, but separate to, the friendly force. In this case, 'Green' is the ANSF," said Maj. Adam Wojack, a media officer with the International Security Assistance Force, referring to the Afghan National Security Forces. The U.S. military is starting to use the term "insider attack" rather than "green-on-blue" because it's easier to understand and because Afghan troops have been victims of the attacks. The NATO-led command did not provide details about the deadly attack in Farah, but a provincial police chief told CNN that an Afghan policeman shot the American service members early Friday during a training session in the Bala Boluk district. Police Chief Aqa Noor Kintos said two U.S. Special Forces members were killed and another was injured. The gunman was killed when troops returned fire, he said. During the gunfight, an Afghan National Police member was also killed, and another was injured, he said. Lt. Col. Hagen Messer, a NATO-led command spokesman, confirmed that two U.S. service members were killed in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility in a text message to journalists, saying a 70-year-old policeman killed the three troops. It's the second time a man in an Afghan security uniform has opened fire on coalition troops in the Bala Boluk district. In December 2011, a gunman posing as an Afghan soldier wounded coalition troops. Official: Man in Afghan security uniform kills 3 U.S. troops In the Kandahar incident, the member of the Afghan National Army who turned his weapon against coalition forces was shot and later died of his wounds after he was taken to an ISAF medical facility. The incident occurred in the province's Zharay district, ISAF said. The frequency of the insider attacks has prompted Afghan intelligence agents to go undercover during recruit training to spot possible extremists, military officials said. Allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force. The U.S. government has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of Omar, who took over Afghanistan in the early 1990s and established a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Omar vanished from public view after a U.S.-led coalition ousted the Taliban and its leaders from power in Afghanistan in December 2001 for refusing to hand over bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. Over the years, he has refused to be photographed or filmed, and has rarely traveled. As a result, Omar's appearance has remained a mystery to many. Those who have met Omar say he has one eye stitched shut, the result of a wound suffered during a battle with Soviet troops during their occupation of Afghanistan. There have been conflicting reports about Omar's fate. As late as last year, the Taliban denied reports the leader was dead. The attacks come a day after a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan killed seven U.S. service members, three Afghan soldiers and an Afghan interpreter. Authorities are investigating whether the crash was caused by technical problems or a shoot-down.
The Morrissey fan site True to You has reported that the singer recently sustained hand and arm injuries after being attacked by a dog. No specific details of the attack have emerged, though it did happen somewhere in England. He was treated for the injury in Malmö, Sweden, where an x-ray revealed a fractured index finger on his right hand. Photos: Morrissey Despite the injury, Morrissey will roll on with his European tour, which will resume with a show tonight at the Operaen in Copenhagen, Denmark. Perhaps Danish fans will be treated to an oldie with reworked lyrics commenting on the dog attack -- "Heaven Knows I'm Rabid Now," "The Boy With the Dog in His Side," "Sheila Take A Bow Wow," or something like that. Don't count on it, though. Copyright © 2010 Rolling Stone.
At least nine people were killed Thursday when a tour bus collided with a truck in Glenn County, California, said California Highway Patrol Officer Timothy Howath. CNN affiliate KRCR reported the passengers on the bus were students going to visit colleges. The bus collided with a FedEx semi-truck near Orland, the affiliate said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the tragic accident on I-5 in California. We are cooperating fully with authorities as they investigate," said FedEx spokeswoman Bonnie Kourvelas. Images from the scene on Interstate 5 showed emergency workers around the vehicles' charred remains. Long lines of traffic snaked away from the accident. Orland is about 100 miles north of Sacramento. Karen White, spokeswoman with Shasta Regional Medical Center, said her hospital has received two patients. "I don't know if any more are coming," she said. In a statement, Humboldt State University in Northern California said it was working to find out more about the crash. "Humboldt State University is getting word of an accident involving a charter bus that was bringing a group of prospective students to the university's April 12 Spring Preview Day," the statement read. CNN's Dave Alsup and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.

A Taliban spokesman issued a series of threats and ultimatums against Pakistani officials Wednesday as the country's military continued its offensive against the militant group in the Swat Valley. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan has courted local and international media in jovial telephone conversations. Speaking on the telephone with CNN, Muslim Khan announced that all national and provincial parliament members from the Malakand Division, the northwestern region where the Swat Valley is located, must resign within three days. "Otherwise, we will arrest all their families," Khan threatened, "and we will destroy all their buildings." The Taliban spokesman issued a separate directive aimed at prompting a public show of support for the militants from Pakistan's Islamist political parties. "All these parties must help the Taliban," Khan said. "They must give a press conference to show the people that we need sharia [Islamic law] in the Malakand Division." Members of the Islamist party Jamaat-i-Islami have spoken out against the military's offensive in the Swat Valley, but they have stopped short of announcing support for the Taliban.  Watch more about the victims of the war » Throughout the fighting over the past three weeks, the gray-bearded Khan has been the public face of the Taliban, enthusiastically courting local and international media in jovial telephone conversations. In an earlier phone interview with CNN, he described how he had spent four years living in the United States, working as a painter in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. On Wednesday, Khan denied reports from many refugees emerging from the Swat Valley that Taliban militants had carried out a campaign of violence and intimidation in the region for the past two years. Several terrified Swat residents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Taliban, described how insurgents kidnapped and killed their critics, beheaded government informers and blew up girls' schools. Khan denied the accusations. "We are killing the people which are only no good for society, like thieves and people who are making problem for the poor people, like people who are working for army," he said. "We are only killing these people." On Tuesday, the Pakistani army announced that it had dropped special forces soldiers by helicopter into the Peochar area of Swat, which is thought to be the headquarters for the region's Taliban's leader, Maulana Fazliullah. Local media report that the Taliban have training camps in Peochar. Khan confirmed that Pakistani troops had attacked Peochar, which he described as a "place for mujaheddin," or holy warriors. The Taliban spokesman said militants and soldiers have been fighting in the mountains around Peochar since Tuesday, and that the clashes continue. He said two Taliban fighters had been killed so far in the battle, along with five Pakistani troops. Meanwhile Wednesday, Taliban militants attacked NATO supply terminals, torching at least 10 supply trucks in northern Pakistan, local officials said. About 70 Taliban fighters attacked the facility in Peshawar, police said. A gunfight ensued between the insurgents and police. No casualties were reported. Peshawar is the capital of the North West Frontier Province, which intelligence officials say is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants there must be trucked in from Pakistan. Convoys carrying food and military supplies have regularly come under attack in the area. Journalist Janullah Hashimzada contributed to this report.
The man accused of kidnapping three Cleveland women and holding them for close to a decade abused all of them but used captive Michelle Knight as his main "punching bag," a family friend of one of the victims told CNN. The friend said suspect Ariel Castro hit Knight with a variety of objects, including hand weights. She has suffered vision loss, joint and muscle damage, and other problems from her time in captivity. Castro, 52, was jailed on charges of kidnapping and rape after one of the women, Amanda Berry, escaped from the home with the aid of neighbors on May 6. Knight, 32, stayed in the hospital for several days after the other two women left. She has released a statement saying she's doing well. "I am healthy, happy and safe and will reach out to family, friends and supporters in good time," Knight said. According to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, the three women told police Castro had abducted them between 2002 and 2004, held them captive and sexually assaulted them. The family friend said Castro treated Berry slightly better than the other two women and Knight was treated the worst. All three women were underweight, the friend said. How the abductions happened Berry gave birth to a daughter fathered by Castro, according to DNA testing by the Ohio state crime lab. Knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home, according to the incident report. When that happened, she told investigators, Castro "starved her for at least two weeks, then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried." Knight said he ordered her to deliver Berry's child, according to a police source familiar with the investigation. The baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid, the source said. Panic ensued soon after. The child stopped breathing, and everyone started screaming, the source said, citing accounts by the young women. Knight said Castro threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive, the initial police report states. "What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old," the police source said. Castro intends to plead not guilty, his attorneys told CNN affiliate WKYC in an exclusive interview. "I know the media wants to jump to conclusions and all the people in the community want to say terrible things about the person who's accused," attorney Jaye Schlachet told the station. "We are not even at the beginning of the process. If this was a marathon race, we're not even at the starting line yet." Castro's defense team may seek to move the trial out of the Cuyahoga County to improve their client's chances for a fair trial, lawyer Craig Weintraub said. He said Castro is "completely isolated from society" without access to television, radio or newspapers and is under suicide watch in a Cuyahoga County jail cell. I, too, am an abduction survivor 'They're the true heroes here' On Wednesday, Cleveland police held a ceremony recognizing the work of officers who responded to the call at Castro's house. Patrol Officer Anthony Espada recalled the emotion at the scene. "It just took everything to hold everything together. I tried to do my best to broadcast all the information over the radio without actually breaking down because I was on the verge," he said. "They were just so brave, going through all that for all those years. They're the true heroes here." He said officers didn't think twice about going into the house. According to the initial report, the women told investigators that they were chained in the basement but later were moved upstairs to rooms on the second floor. They were allowed out of the home only twice, and then just briefly. Since their release, Knight and Gina DeJesus, the third captive, have talked on the phone at least once, according to a source who has been talking to all the victims' families and attorneys. One of the them asked to speak with the other after they were freed, said the source. The women are learning how to use new, and not-so-new, technology they missed out on during their years in captivity, the source said. A glimpse of Castro's yard Who is Michelle Knight? Knight's disappearance generated far less publicity and attention than did those of Berry and DeJesus, and a level of mystery still surrounds her case. Cleveland police removed Knight's name from an FBI database of missing people in November 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said. They did so after "failing to locate a parent, guardian or other reporting person to confirm that Ms. Knight was still missing." Police said, though, that her missing person's case remained open and was checked on as recently as November 2012. As of last week, her family still didn't know exactly where she was. Knight hadn't spoken yet with her mother, Barbara, a family spokesperson said. In fact, Knight's family had no idea where she was and had asked police for information on her whereabouts. What little is known about Knight's whereabouts comes from a source close to the investigation, who told CNN that Knight "is in a safe place and very comfortable." The source did not specify further. There were reports that Knight was at the DeJesus home, and there was a lot of activity there Saturday morning, but Knight was not there. Ohio women just want to be with families The Knight family apparently has a fractured history. According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Knight became pregnant and dropped out of school. Her mother told the newspaper that she then became involved with an abusive man, who, she thinks, hurt her toddler grandson. The incident reportedly kicked off "a chain of events that led Michelle to lose custody of the child." Knight vanished soon after that, on a day she was set to make a court appearance in the custody case, Barbara Knight told the Plain Dealer. Times weren't always so tough for Knight though. Her mother recalled happier days, when her daughter had lots of friends and fed apples to a neighbor's pony. She liked fire engines and art class. After helping her mother deliver a litter of puppies, Knight decided she likely wanted to be a veterinarian, Barbara Knight told the Plain Dealer. "I really miss her," she reportedly said. "She was my daughter, but she was also my friend. She tried to make the best of her life and wanted to finish school. She never got the chance to go back."

The winners of the 2012 Webby Awards were announced on Tuesday, Established in 1996, the Webby Awards are arguably the Internet's best-known honors. After starting small, the Webbys now hand out more than 100 awards each year. Many of each year's honorees tend to be celebrities, big companies or well-known online entities. Among this year's big winners are Pinterest (best social media app), photo-sharing app Instagram (breakout of the year), and the comedian Louis C.K., honored by the Webbys for creating "a new precedent for distribution" by releasing his comedy special through his own website. A raft of advertising and corporate website awards have also been added over the years. But the Internet being the Internet, there will always be lesser-known, innovative and downright quirky winners as well. Here's a look at five Webby Award winners we think are worth a closer look. Draw A Stickman (Best Use of Animation or Motion Graphics) Are you frustrated that your masterpieces on "Draw Something" can't come to life? Or maybe you're just nostalgic for "Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings," the '70s animated feature in which the things Simon draws come true? Worry no more. "Draw a Stickman" is here to help. Available both as a website and a mobile app, the premise is simple. Draw a stick figure, or a more fleshed-out character if you have the drawing chops. Then click "play" on one of two episodes currently available and watch your drawing get animated through an adventure that will require you to help him, or her, along by drawing new items such as a key needed to unlock a box. When you're done, you can share the results via social media, browse a gallery of other users' drawings or even buy a T-shirt with your drawing on it. Counterspill (Activism website) Winner of judges' and People's Choice Webbys, Counterspill is a nonprofit site devoted to reporting information about natural disasters involving oil, coal and other energy companies. The site's scope is impressive. Not only does it track such recent events as the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant, but it also documents historical events dating all the way back to the 1940s. The site unabashedly has a political slant. It aims to counteract what it calls spin by energy companies and governments in the wake of disasters. (The companies and government agencies involved in disasters are deemed "culprits.") Among the site's partners is Chris Paine, director of the acclaimed documentaries "Who Killed the Electric Car?" and "Revenge of the Electric Car." Clouds 365 Project (Personal Blog) For artist Kelly DeLay, it started in 2009 as a personal challenge: Shoot a still image or video of clouds for 365 consecutive days as a way to ensure he did something creative every day. "I wanted this practice of observation to be tied into the fabric of my life -- the habit of looking up and noticing the patterns and beauty of the clouds that envelop us every single day," he wrote. Three years and more than 1,000 images later, he's still going. His site has become not just a beautiful gallery (it's astounding how each day's formation looks different from the last) but a reminder to us all to tap into the creative spirit when we can. The Human Body (Mobile apps, Education & Reference) Whether you're a medical student or just a curious amateur anatomist, this iPad-only app gives as detailed a look at the inner workings of our bodies as you can imagine on a mobile device. It features over 270 high-resolution images that let users zoom in and out as well as a "3D rotatable human body with selectable layers." If that's not interactive enough, it also promises "functions you can feel" -- letting you grab your iPad to feel lungs breathe, a heart beat and even the movement of nerve impulses. The Creators Project (Music) Vice, in a partnership with Intel, launched The Creators Project as a way to support artists in music, visual arts, dance and other disciplines who use technology as part of their work. Now entering its third year, The Creators Project publishes a daily blog and hosts an online community of millions who come to either take part or see the art that's created through the project. It sponsors a content-creation studio and has partnered with public events like the Coachella music festival to highlight the work of its artists. Artists can apply to be part of the studio, or any user can nominate an artist they think is deserving.
Philadelphia's 218 public schools may not open on time in September unless the district receives $50 million from the city by Friday, Superintendent William Hite says. Hite gave the city the ultimatum after the layoff of close to 3,800 employees this summer due to a "drastic financial shortfall." The massive layoffs included aides, assistant principals, social workers and arts teachers. If the city doesn't pay up by Friday, Hite says, the district may not be able to open all 218 schools for a full-day program on September 9. "Without the funds to restore crucial staff members, we cannot open functional schools, run them responsibly or provide a quality education to students," Hite said. Mayor Michael Nutter called it one of "the most chilling" statements he had ever heard a superintendent make, but he said stands "shoulder to shoulder" with Hite and will not allow schools to open with the staff that he can currently afford. Hite and Nutter have urged the City Council to extend a 1% sales tax to make up the difference but -- despite approval from the General Assembly and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett -- City Council President Darrell L. Clarke says he would rather focus those funds on the city's critical pension problem. If the city does not solve the retirement fund issues, Clarke said, Philadelphia could quickly follow in the footsteps of other major cities with significant financial problems. As an alternative, Clarke proposed the city purchase the school district's surplus vacant real estate for $50 million and sell the property to developers who could turn it into potential job producers. Hite does not believe that will bring the district closer to financial stability, according to Fernando Gallard, spokesman for the school district. Hite and Nutter are also negotiating a contract with the local teachers' union, hoping to save money by asking teachers to make concessions on certain benefits. Because there has been no agreement with the union, $45 million in aid from the state previously allocated to the school district is being withheld. Once the negotiations are complete the funding will be released, Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said Tuesday. With Hite's Friday deadline looming, Mayor Nutter said he believes opening the school district without the necessary funding would be "irresponsible." "We have what we have and we fight another day to get more," Nutter said.
On November 11, Americans pay tribute to everyone who has served in the U.S. military. But why was this particular date chosen, and how does this holiday differ from Memorial Day? Origins of Veterans Day World War I, also known as "The Great War," was fought from 1914 to 1918. During this conflict, Great Britain, France, Russia, Belgium, Italy, Japan, the United States and other countries, which formed the "Allies," defeated the so-called "Central Powers," which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire) and Bulgaria. On the "eleventh hour, of the eleventh day, of the eleventh month" of 1918, German leaders signed an armistice, or a halt to hostilities, with the Allied powers. On that date, November 11, celebrations were held in New York City, Paris, London and in other cities around the globe. The following year, President Woodrow Wilson declared November 11 as "Armistice Day," a day to observe the end of World War I. On June 4, 1926, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution asking President Calvin Coolidge to call upon officials to "display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies of friendly relations with all other peoples." Twelve years later, on May 13, 1938, Congress passed an Act making the 11th of November Armistice Day, a federal holiday. Initially, Armistice Day was supposed to honor veterans of World War I. But after the call to arms and human sacrifices during World War II and the Korean conflict, veterans' groups urged Congress to consider a day to celebrate U.S. veterans of all wars. On June 1, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day. Difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day Veterans Day in the United States is a day to honor all Americans who have served in the U.S. military, both during wartime and in peace. Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring Americans who have died serving the nation, especially those who died in battle or from wounds received during armed conflicts. On Veterans Day, Americans thank the living veterans for their service to the country and recognize all who have served the country. Veterans Day Proclamation The following is the text of President George W. Bush's 2008 Veterans Day Proclamation: On Veterans Day, we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men and women who in defense of our freedom have bravely worn the uniform of the United States. From the fields and forests of war-torn Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia, from the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan, brave patriots have protected our Nation's ideals, rescued millions from tyranny, and helped spread freedom around the globe. America's veterans answered the call when asked to protect our Nation from some of the most brutal and ruthless tyrants, terrorists, and militaries the world has ever known. They stood tall in the face of grave danger and enabled our Nation to become the greatest force for freedom in human history. Members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard have answered a high calling to serve and have helped secure America at every turn. Our country is forever indebted to our veterans for their quiet courage and exemplary service. We also remember and honor those who laid down their lives in freedom's defense. These brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice for our benefit. On Veterans Day, we remember these heroes for their valor, their loyalty, and their dedication. Their selfless sacrifices continue to inspire us today as we work to advance peace and extend freedom around the world. With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America's veterans. NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2008, as Veterans Day and urge all Americans to observe November 9 through November 15, 2008, as National Veterans Awareness Week. I encourage all Americans to recognize the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to support and participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this national observance with commemorative expressions and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is clinging to a narrow lead over Republican challenger Thom Tillis in North Carolina, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows. Hagan led with 48% support to 46% for Tillis, the state House speaker, in the survey of 559 likely voters, conducted Oct. 27-30 and with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Libertarian Sean Haugh polled at 4%. Hampering Tillis is an underwater favorability rating. Just 43% of those surveyed said they have a favorable view of him, compared to 50% who view him unfavorably. That's a dramatic shift since a September CNN/ORC International poll that put his favorability rating at 47%, with just a 40% viewing him unfavorably. "Hagan seems to have done a good job of defining her lesser-known challenger in an unflattering light," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "The jump in Tillis' unfavorables is highest among women (a 12-point increase), lower-income voters (12 points), and particularly in the suburbs (16 points)," Holland said. Hagan, meanwhile, is viewed favorably by 49%, while 48% say they view her unfavorably. She could be dragged down, though, by President Barack Obama's unpopularity. Just 42% said they approve of Obama's job performance. Tillis leads among suburban and rural voters, earning 49% support in each category compared to 43% support for Hagan among suburban voters and 44% with rural voters. Hagan, though, holds a massive lead in urban areas, where she has 59% support to Tillis' 37%. Hagan leads by 16 percentage points among women and Tillis is up 12 points with men. North Carolina is one of several states that President Barack Obama won at least once -- Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire are the others -- where Republicans are hoping to grab Senate seats previously held by Democrats. Their success in those states could determine whether the GOP captures the six seats it needs to become the Senate's majority party for Obama's last two years in office. The CNN/ORC International results come after several other polls have put Hagan ahead. An Elon University survey conducted Oct. 21-25 put the freshman senator up 45% to 41%, while a Rasmussen Reports poll showed her up 47% to 46%. The race has been the most expensive of the 2014 midterm cycle, with spending by the campaigns, national committees and outside groups topping $100 million.
whose parents had to launch a media campaign to get him the medicine -- is sitting up, doing homework and playing board games with his brothers, his mother said. Just last week, Josh was so sick he could barely get out even a few words. He was in heart and kidney failure, and vomited blood several times an hour as his family held a vigil in the intensive care unit of a Memphis hospital. Josh received doses of the drug brincidofovir Wednesday, Saturday, and Tuesday, and tests showed the level of adenovirus in his blood went down from 250,000 copies per milliliter to 367 copies per milliliter. "We expect it will be out of his system by Tuesday," his mother, Aimee Hardy, said Friday. "I'm beside myself with how effective this drug was so quickly." Already they're seeing results of the waning virus in Josh's system. He no longer has bleeding in his stomach and intestines. Before receiving brincidofovir, Josh was fighting for his life. The adenovirus was ravaging his immune system, left vulnerable by treatment for cancer, and the only available antiviral drug to treat it wasn't working. In early February, Chimerix, the company that makes brincidofovir, refused to give Josh its experimental drug. But after reports by CNN and intense pressure from social media, Chimerix and the Food and Drug Administration came up with a plan to get the medicine to Josh and other patients who request it. Drug company will give ailing 7-year-old medicine that could save him Traditionally, drug companies have not been allowed to use so-called "compassionate use" patients like Josh as study subjects, so helping them out has been pure charity work on behalf of the drug company. But the FDA allowed Chimerix to use data from Josh and others as part of its application to the FDA, helping to get the drug on the market faster. Seven other adenovirus patients have inquired about being the next in line to get the drug, according to Kenneth Moch, the president of Chimerix, and several of those patients have already received doses. Even though the virus seems to be leaving Josh's body, his mother says his kidneys are still in danger. In February, his kidneys were just starting to recover from the damage of powerful chemotherapy. But then the adenovirus struck, and his doctors had no choice but to give him an antiviral drug that further damaged his kidneys. Now that Josh is taking brincidofovir, he's no longer taking the other drug that hurt his kidneys, but the damage was done: His kidneys still aren't working and he has to undergo dialysis three times a week. His mother worries he might be on dialysis the rest of his life. "What if he has to be on dialysis long-term? If he could have gotten the brincidofovir earlier, it could have been avoided. That will always bother me," she said. Josh Hardy's father says son faces 'long road to recovery' She's also worried about something else -- Josh's state of mind. As recently as last month, Josh had a "go get 'em" attitude about fighting his illness, his mother says. But now, even though he's getting better, she says he seems to be exhausted after months of being sick and lacks motivation. "I haven't seen him smile lately," she said. "I try to get him to chant every day, 'I'm as good as new.' "
A Bronx woman has been charged with murder and robbery in the death of an 89-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor, and police said a man is still being sought in connection with the death. Felix Brinkmann dances at a 2008 birthday party. "He was not the kind of guy who had enemies," his son says. Angela Murray, 30, was arrested Saturday, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office, and is accused of strangling Guido Felix Brinkmann on Thursday in his Upper East Side apartment. Murray was arraigned Sunday and charged with one count of murder in the second degree and three counts of robbery. Brinkmann, a native of Latvia, was a Holocaust survivor who escaped death for a year while he was in the Mauthausen, Ebensee and Auschwitz camps. He had been slated for the gas chambers five times, but each time, he used his fluency in German to talk his way out, said his son, Rick Brinkman, who spells his last name differently. After the war, he was stunned to discover his wife, who had also been shipped to Auschwitz, alive and well in Poland. The Brinkmanns immigrated to America, where Brinkmann spent years in the bar and nightclub business, co-founding the Adam's Apple disco in Manhattan in 1971. In recent years, he had been the real estate manager of a mixed-use building in the Bronx, working "seven days a week, without fail," Rick Brinkman said. On Thursday, the building's superintendent grew concerned when Brinkmann did not show up for work. He notified Brinkmann's son and received permission to enter the father's apartment, where he had lived alone since his wife died last year. Brinkmann was found face-down in his bedroom, his hands bound behind his back and his body showing blunt-force trauma wounds, police said. Brinkmann's blue 2009 Honda Civic had been stolen, along with one of two safes in his apartment, police said. The vehicle was later recovered in the Bronx. Rick Brinkman speculated that the killing was random. "Anybody who knew him really liked him," the son said. "He was not the kind of guy who had enemies." CNN's Jason Kessler contributed to this report.
The spread of the potentially fatal Middle East respiratory syndrome has become more serious and urgent, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. At the same time, WHO said that -- for now, at least -- the illness known as MERS does not constitute a global health emergency Declaring an emergency is "a major act" that can "raise anxieties," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the organization's assistant director-general for health security. Despite concerns about the syndrome, researchers have not found "any increasing evidence of person-to-person transmissibility," he said. There have been 571 confirmed cases of MERS, including 171 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of countries with confirmed cases expanded to 18, with a case in the Netherlands, WHO reported Wednesday. Many of the cases are in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Even without any official worldwide alert, Anne Schuchat, the head of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, acknowledges that "this is a relatively new virus that does have a high fatality rate," ample reason to pay attention. Authorities haven't pinned down all the details about how exactly it arose and how it spreads, though Schuchat said, "we don't have evidence right now that this is airborne ... the way the measles virus is." "We don't know as much as we would like so far," the CDC official and assistant surgeon general in the U.S. Public Health Service told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday. "... But we're tracking it and trying to understand." Florida health care workers test negative Two cases have been confirmed in the United States. Both patients are health care providers who were working in Saudi Arabia. The first is in Indiana; the second in Florida. Two health care workers who came in contact with the Florida patient later went to an emergency room with flu-like symptoms. But they tested negative for MERS in a state test, the CDC said Wednesday. The Florida MERS patient, specifically, was fever-free and continuing to improve Wednesday while undergoing treatment at Orlando's Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, the state's health department said. Given the virus' apparent roots in the Arabian Peninsula, Schuchat said it's important that health care workers ask anyone who has suspicious "respiratory symptoms" where they have been in recent weeks. "More and more people are going to be traveling the next couple of months, so we really want clinicians to be on the lookout," she said. Commercial airlines are on guard as well, including efforts to make sure those who might have come into contact with the two MERS patients in the United States didn't come down with the virus. American Airlines said in a statement that it is "working very closely with the Centers for Disease Control, and contacted our flight crew as soon as we learned of (one such) diagnosis. The CDC is in the process of contacting passengers to advise them of any necessary precautions." "We are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring the good health of our employees and customers," the airline said. And Delta Airlines said that, like all carriers, it "has a long-standing protocol for working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as we are in this instance. The safety of our customers and employees is Delta's top priority." One traveler who was on one possibly affected flight told CNN affiliate WMKG that the call she got about one confirmed case of MERS left her "really scared." Twelve days after her flight, she said, her state health department called and sent her a note asking whether she had symptoms such as fever or cough, and also saying she should record her temperature for two weeks. "I was in shock that I could actually contract it," she said. The woman, who did not want to be identified, said she and her husband so far had no symptoms. Another traveler, Ben Kinney, told CNN affiliate WXIA that the CDC called him twice in two days, saying he was on a flight from Boston to Atlanta with someone who had MERS. He said officials would not disclose how close he was to the patient. Four people -- each from different families -- have been tested in San Antonio for MERS because they were on a plane with one of the two confirmed U.S. patients, said San Antonio health department spokeswoman Carol Schliesinger. None of those four had any suspicious symptoms, she added. Tests for two of them have come back negative for MERS, while the other results are expected in the next couple of days. MERS doesn't spread like flu MERS, first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, is a coronavirus -- the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. There is no vaccine or special treatment. Besides those who contract the virus by coming into "very close contact" with someone suffering, Schuchat cited "a lot of interesting studies ... about camels and whether some sort of exposure to camels or their products might be important" in explaining MERS origins. While little is known definitively, "Fortunately, so far, it hasn't shown itself easily to spread from person to person," she added. Dr. William Schaffner, head of preventive medicine of Vanderbilt Medical Center explained Wednesday on CNN's "New Day" that MERS can "spread in the context of providing health care. "That's very important. And it has occasionally spread in Saudi Arabia from one family member to another. It requires close, constant, over time exposure." People who go to a doctor or hospital with respiratory symptoms should be asked immediately whether they've traveled to the Middle East or been in contact with someone who did. "If the answer is yes, you put that person in isolation," Schaffner said. Specimens are then taken and sent to the CDC for further testing. "That system is working," he said. Florida's health secretary, Dr. John Armstrong, said Wednesday that the case in his state "is contained." "There is no broad threat to the general public," Armstrong said. 5 things to know about MERS Hagel, others checked for fever Representatives of 13 countries made up the WHO emergency committee that convened Tuesday through a phone conference, the WHO said. Affected countries need to take immediate steps to improve infection prevention and control, the WHO said. The majority of infections have taken place inside hospitals. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel got a firsthand brush Wednesday with fear of the disease in the land of its likely origin. Before a meeting in Saudi Arabia with Crown Prince Salman Abdulaziz in Jeddah, everyone entering the room with Hagel unwittingly passed by a device screening for fever. Its operators told reporters that they were checking for people who might be infected with the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome. They found no one with a raised temperature. WHO does not recommend such a tactic in general, Fukuda said. Some MERS patients don't have fevers, so just checking temperatures could "create a false sense of security," he said. The CDC is not recommending that anyone change travel plans. The U.S. State Department has instructed its embassies and consulates in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Jordan, Kuwait, and the UAE to provide U.S. citizens with CDC's general guidance for infection control, a State Department official said. CNN's Greg Botelho, Miriam Falco, Elizabeth Cohen, Debra Goldschmidt, Aaron Cooper, Jen Christensen and Athena Jones contributed to this report.
Blockbuster videogame heroes have tamed the Wild West, repelled alien invasions and driven the Nazis from Normandy. But can they fight off "Angry Birds"? The popular mobile app hit 50 million downloads last year, and the iPad version made waves last week at the DICE Summit here when it was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' prestigious Game of the Year award. "Angry Birds" didn't win -- that honor went to "Mass Effect 2" -- but it was the first time a smartphone game had broken free of the Best Mobile Game ghetto and moved up into the big leagues. With a reported development cost of about $150,000, the addictive fowl-flinging game is racking up ungodly profits. Ironically, it's quite likely that a great portion of those dollars are coming not from your mom and other casual gamers but from hard-core players more likely to get deep into Halo than to spend a few minutes with an iPhone time-waster. At the annual confab of game executives, eye-opening stats outlined the evolving habits of hard-core gamers, who are spending a surprising amount of time playing games on smartphones and tablets. WIRED: Videogames need auteurs, but good luck finding them Anita Frazier, an analyst with the NPD Group, said game console owners spend more time playing mobile games than do those in the general population. And 38 percent of people who play social networking games like "FarmVille" are "established console gamers," she said. "Is there anybody in this room who really thought they would have been spending a lot of time playing social network games?" Frazier asked the audience. The surprising popularity of casual games among even the hardest of the hard-core foreshadows a sea change for an industry that over the years has grown to resemble Hollywood, complete with star directors, creaking franchises and budgets that dwarf the annual operating costs of a small city. As indie and casual titles lure gamers away from powerful consoles, some big gamemakers are scrambling to imitate the success of Facebook and iPhone games. EA Sports boss Peter Moore's assertion that the gaming industry is "standing on a burning oil platform" kept coming up at DICE. The metaphor is clear: Stand still and it's certain death; jump into the chilly waters and you just might live. Everyone seems to agree that it's time to jump. But nobody quite knows what direction to swim. "I think it's going to be crazy in the next few years," said BioWare CEO Ray Muzyka in his DICE keynote. "A lot of existing [industry] players are going to have to adapt in order to survive and to thrive." The social blockbuster Travis Boatman, vice president of Electronic Arts' mobile business, said that contrary to the popular belief that mobile games are played in brief bursts while on the go, about half of all mobile game time is spent at home. By porting hard-core titles like survival-horror game "Dead Space" to iOS, EA is pursuing Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners who would rather sit on their couch and play with their iPads instead. "I don't think it's all about us quitting our jobs and making 'Angry Birds' and 'FarmVille' clones," said Jade Raymond, managing director of Ubisoft Toronto and producer of "Assassin's Creed," in an interview with Wired.com. Raymond, who referenced Moore's dire predictions in her own DICE speech, said she wants any new gaming franchise created by her company to include robust social features that connect gamers with friends. WIRED: When game developers go Indie, everybody wins Games shouldn't be the water-cooler discussion topic but the water cooler itself, the hub around which socialization occurs, she said. That's already the case with "FarmVille," but not with the type of $60 Blu-ray games that directors like Raymond create. She pointed to rival Activision's "Call of Duty: Black Ops," which allows players to bet in-game currency on the outcomes of online matches, as an interesting example of how to build a better blockbuster. "The whole wager system ... adds a whole new dimension to multiplayer gameplay," she said. Both Ubisoft and Electronic Arts have made efforts at pushing their big game franchises onto Facebook, hoping that snagging social gamers and getting them interested in the series will get them to spend big bucks on the blockbusters. Ubisoft rolled out a Facebook game for "Assassin's Creed," while EA crafted a social game based on its upcoming role-playing game "Dragon Age II." Besides mixing social features into big games, publishers are likely to pursue core gamers who'd rather play on mobile devices. EA's Boatman says the success of complex iPad games like "Dead Space" and Epic's "Infinity Blade" show that many traditional gamers are getting sucked in by robust, console-style content sold at a cheaper price on mobile platforms. End of the cycle With "Assassin's Creed," Ubisoft's Raymond oversaw the launch of the biggest new game franchise of the era, one that has sold 19 million copies since 2007. But she's conscious of the fact that the game market is getting squeezed at the top. "To be one of those big blockbusters that's really profitable is very hard," she said. "You have to be in the top five." WIRED: Farm wars -- how Facebook games harvest big bucks Not the best odds. Raymond's plan to integrate social features into her games a la "Call of Duty" seems to be a push to get into that top tier again. But for all but the biggest publishers, the top may not be worth shooting for anymore. Mark Cerny, a game design consultant and creator of classics like "Marble Madness" and "Crash Bandicoot," said in his DICE speech that the future of $50 million blockbuster games is "looking a little shaky." If Raymond's math is right, Cerny is understating the situation. "There aren't many of these high-budget games," he said. Only about 60 games sold more than 1 million units last year, according to Cerny, and a game produced on a relatively thrifty $20 million budget has a much better chance of being profitable in that environment. But he's not sure publishers can staunch the spending spree. "There's no intrinsic value to a $50 million game," Cerny said. He likened the situation to Hollywood, where the cost of making summer tent-pole films has spiraled upward in the last decade. "Waterworld" was widely mocked for its $175 million budget in 1995, but that kind of money is routinely spent on big films today. The trouble, Cerny said, is that the games industry has learned how to spend big gobs of money just like those movie moguls. "In 1994, if someone had given me $20 million, I would have had no idea how to spend it," he said, but game teams have become bloated with superspecialized jobs these days. To pare these groups back to only the essential members would be a daunting task, he said, but there's a silver lining: The rapid advance of game console technology seems to have slowed down. New game machines won't materialize for a while, and anything that comes out probably won't be as radical a leap in power as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 were over the previous generation of consoles. "We can take time now to learn our craft," said Cerny. "To learn what is important to spend money on, and what isn't." Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

Only a fraction of the oil that normally courses through the Trans Alaska pipeline was flowing early Sunday after operators discovered a leak near Prudhoe Bay, a company spokeswoman said. Crews making a routine inspection "found oil in the basement of a booster pump building" around 9 a.m. Saturday, according to Aleyeska Pipeline Service Company spokeswoman Michelle Egan, who said flow has been reduced by 95%. On a typical day, 642,261 barrels of oil would pass through the pipeline. "Crews are currently onsite to assess the situation and isolate the source of the leak," a company statement said. CNN's Tom Laabs contributed to this report.
At a time of economic uncertainty in the U.S., the writers strike cast a dark cloud over the eternal sunshine of the Californian mindset and its most glittering awards ceremony. Oscar winner Helen Mirren dazzled in Chopard diamonds last year and gained masses of publicity for the jeweler Up until a fortnight ago, the million dollar question was whether the Oscars would go ahead as stars refused to cross the picket line. Make that the 400 million dollar question. According to the pundits and bean-counters, that's how much the strike would have cost Los Angeles and the industry if Hollywood's most glamorous evening had been cancelled. Not only would the stars have been robbed of their moment to shimmer along the world's most famous red carpet, but a whole hinterland of ancillary trades would be affected. Limo drivers driven to despair, caterers with no-one to cater for, make-up artists struggling to make up lost earnings and security teams facing an insecure future -- and the paparazzi would have no-one to focus on. But it's not just the little guys who would have lost out on the Oscars millions. Big-name jewelry designers like Chopard traditionally dress the stars. Kate Winslet, Charlize Theron and Hilary Swank are among their successful models at the Academy Awards. Last year, Helen Mirren wore a 55 carat diamond flower bracelet along with a 62 carat diamond brooch worth $4m dollars to accept the Best Actress gong. It is estimated that having a celebrity pictured in an item of jewelry or an outfit can be worth $1m in publicity for a jeweler or fashion house. With hundreds of celebrities strutting the red carpet on Oscars night, the scope for generating revenue is seemingly endless. But even Chopard's famous sparkle was tested by the uncertainty surrounding this year's event. "Leading up to the Oscars business for the whole of Rodeo Drive was a little sketchy. Everyone was thinking, what's gonna happen?" Wes Carroll, Chopard spokesman, told CNN. "We felt for the writers, we felt for the studios and we wanted a great outcome for everyone. We would have been very disappointed had the Oscars not happened." Films which achieve success at the Academy Awards can expect a new injection of cash with a boost in DVD sales and renewed interest at the box office. Robert Buchsbaum, a Los Angeles theater boss, told CNN, "It's not just the studios who are affected by the Academy Awards show. It's theater owners. As a single-screen theater owner, my whole year is based on how well films perform from November through March through the Academy Awards. It's the busiest time of year for me." "We really try to figure out, not just what the big Academy Award film is gonna be -- the Best Picture -- but also the smaller films, the independent films which might get the edge like Juno and There Will Be Blood, films which will have a lot of legs to them once they get the nomination," he continued. "It usually means between 25% and 75% in box office revenues alone." The prime candidate for a new lease of life at the box office is the Coen Brothers' film, "No Country for Old Men." On the opposite side of the U.S., New York critics are expecting it to yield a decent crop of Oscars after taking their own awards night by storm. Stephen Whitty, Chair of the New York Film Critics' Circle, told CNN, "It won best picture because the direction from the Coen brothers was really assured. They were completely in control of the mood throughout that film. "I think the screenplay, also by the Coens, while being truthful to Cormack McCarthy's book, managed to turn it into cinema," he continued. "It made it consistently visual and imparted its message and its mood through images. The acting -- and again, Javier Bardem got the fourth of the four awards we gave it -- I thought the acting was spot on throughout." Will the rest of the results be equally clear cut? If so, the tips are Daniel Day Lewis and Julie Christie for Best Leads, Diablo Cody for Original Screenplay for "Juno," "Atonement" for Best Score, Mike Moore for Best Documentary for "Sicko," and in the Year of the Rat, Best Animation is marked for "Ratatouille." But of course, no one can really be that certain. Just ask producer Graham King, who seemed set to take Best Picture for "The Aviator" after it won virtually every award except the Nobel Peace Prize. But it wasn't to be, after Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" pipped him to the post. Then a year ago, King finally won the big one with "The Departed." One year on from winning the Oscar, he spoke with CNN's Quest team about how his life changed. "I think for a good few months after the Academy Awards I was floating on air," he said. "It was really hard to come down from it and it was hard to realize that you'd achieved the goal that you'd set out to achieve many years ago. There it is: in one night, you've got it." And as King explains, even Oscar-winning Hollywood producers are prone to attacks of the jitters too. "It was a year where I just took stock and decided what I wanted to do next and what kind of movies I want to make," he told CNN. "Then, bam! We get hit with this strike, which was horrendous. I felt like I was unemployed ... your phone calls go from 60 or 70 a day to three and emails were not coming in and I felt really insecure about it." For producers like King, the end of the writers strike is crucial for their business -- far more important than whether the Oscar ceremony takes place. But imagine being producer of the Best Picture in the one year when the ceremony was cancelled. And it's inconceivable to think of Hollywood without the Oscars. Picture Rio without its Carnival, London without the Queen, New York without the Statue of Liberty. The famous statuettes of Los Angeles may be somewhat smaller, but their presence is felt far beyond the Hollywood hills ... E-mail to a friend
It's billed as "the happiest place on Earth." And Friday, Disneyland's Tokyo theme park reopened in hopes of bringing some of that missing happiness back to the Japanese people. The park has been closed since the March 11 earthquake that devastated northern Japan and the electricity shortage that followed. Disney fans lined up as early as 6:30 a.m., an hour and a half before Friday's reopening, hoping to be the first into the park. Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy, and a host of other Disney characters surprised visitors as the gates opened at 8 a.m. A sort of Disney hysteria swept over the crowd as Mickey danced in front of visitors minutes before the official opening of the park. "We were so excited, we were almost crying," Tokyo Disneyland visitor Mika Hasegawa said. The re-opening comes at a critical time for Japan, as the country struggles to regain some semblance of normalcy after the earthquake and tsunami that killed 13,500 people in the country's northeast. Many Tokyo residents have refrained from excessive celebrations and parties out of respect for the victims. But Disneyland visitor Minako Ootsuka said that while Japanese people should be mindful of the disaster, it's also important to have a good time and release stress. Hiroshi Suzuki, public relations manager for Oriental Land Co. -- the company that owns Tokyo Disneyland -- agreed. He said visitors were so elated when they saw Mickey and the other characters, he wished he could bring that kind of happiness to all people in Japan. Other visitors to the park said they thought it was important to start getting out and spending money to get the economy running again. Erika Kanehira said she planned on visiting Tokyo Disneyland as often as she could and would also purchase merchandise to help the disaster area recover. For every guest admitted to the park through May 14, Tokyo Disneyland will donate 300 yen (about $4) to the Japanese Red Cross. The park will also be operating under shortened business hours in order to save power. Suzuki says the company hopes to get the park up and running on usual business hours as soon as possible. But most visitors are happy to have the park back at all. Tomomi Takehashi said Disneyland was a place where people can come to laugh and smile -- and that may be exactly what the Japanese public needs right now.
including a substantial boost in tourism -- in a press conference in the state's capital Wednesday. "Our goal is a rural economic revival," he said, according to the Portland Press Herald. "Rural Maine is dying and we need to stop that. Marijuana is not the golden ticket, but it's part of the solution." To be eligible for a voter referendum in November 2016, about 61,000 signatures would be needed by January 2016. McCarrier said the group hopes to collect about 80,000 signatures in the state, and will start their activism soon. If the plan is approved, adults aged 21 and older would be allowed to possess an unlimited amount of pot in their homes -- and they'd also be permitted to grow the plant, provided they obtain a license. The goal is to give at least 75 percent of these licenses to owners of small farms in an effort to cultivate statewide industry. Like alcohol, marijuana would be taxed at 8%, and its use would be permitted in clubs. The Marijuana Policy Project, a national group based in Washington, D.C., is also working toward a ballot initiative in Maine. This group also needs signatures to make it on the ballot -- but so far, it is unclear whether the two activist organizations will work together. In some Maine cities, voters voiced support earlier this month for recreational pot legalization, while the initiative was defeated in other regions. These votes were largely symbolic, though, as there is not yet any overarching state or federal laws on the books. Medical marijuana has been legal in the Pine Tree State since 1999. So far, only four states -- Colorado, Washington, Alaska and Oregon, as well as D.C. -- have legalized recreational marijuana. Laws in these places remain hazy, as consuming marijuana is still listed as a Schedule 1 narcotic under federal law. As the tide continues to turn in favor of legal marijuana on the state level, a bipartisan group members of Congress have clamored for legal adjustments on the national level. "It's not more dangerous than methamphetamines or cocaine," said Oregon Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer at an event last week, pointing out that there were zero deaths caused by marijuana last year. For the first time, most Americans favored pot legalization in October: The idea garnered 58% percent support, according to an October Gallup poll.
a world renowned love expert -- determining who you'll ultimately end up with comes down to identifying four main lanes, each of which is linked to a specific hormone: 1)    "The Explorer," a thrill seeker, linked to dopamine 2)    "The Builder," a traditional calm thinker, linked to serotonin 3)    "The Director," a competitive and analytical thinker, linked to testosterone 4)    "The Negotiator," the compassionate idealist, linked to estrogen "We are all made up of a unique combination of all four different styles of thinking -- but in different proportions.  And this affects who is drawn to whom," shares Spurlock.  "Dr. Fisher believes certain hormone dominant personalities compliment others." The Internet is full of countless dating apps, but not all cars are comfortable to every driver. (If you're looking for long-term love, steer clear of "Tinder.")  Before choosing which app to hitch your wagon to, navigate your way to CNN's handy "What dating app is right for you?" flow chart, a go-to guideline that puts you in the drivers seat to love. Far too often a given driver is guilty of not paying nearly enough attention to his or her journey, instead burying a pair of eyeballs in an iPhone while a potential partner ends up in the rearview mirror like a missed exit. Instead of texting, try talking, and actually engaging.  You know, like Tarzan and Jane did. "I teach people how to meet people.  What I'm working to do is to get people you know off their phones and engaging with people," says Anthony Recenello, a self-described "Social Development Coach." While chucking the smartphone out the passenger side window is probably unrealistic, Recenello says going lo-tech can heighten ones chances of truly connecting: "The ability to just be there present with another person is the thing that people are losing." On a course as complicated as dating, there's no reason to ride solo -- especially with so many experienced travelers available for assistance. As a part of Thursday's episode, Spurlock checks in with a professional "wingman," several professional matchmaking services and multiple profile coaches, all of which boast an ability to keep daters on track. "We do the work for you.  We meet everyone," explains Talia Goldstein, founder of matchmaking service "Three Day Rule."  "When we find a great match, then we set you up on a date." Of course few singles are as outgoing and charismatic as Spurlock, so an online dating coach may be a better way of staying the course.  In "Money can buy you love -- or at least make you dateable," CNN breaks down a collection of sites offering everything from assistance with profile writing to live dating advice. On a roadtrip of any length, falling asleep at the wheel is a cardinal sin; cruising for companionship is no different. As the "Inside Man" explores individual landmarks this week, one constant theme remains: stay awake, and keep on coming.  In visiting with "OKCupid," one of the world's premier dating sites, Spurlock learns of creating ones own path to a successful relationship: "OKCupid's philosophy is that you don't need to wait for destiny to take its course when you could use a mathematical model instead to find your one true love." In the same way a safe driver crunches the numbers on an odometer or fuel gauge, an OKCupid member deals with data in the form of a relatively simple algorithm: "We let people weigh an importance.  So like if you really, really care about scary movies or whatever you could max it out or if you just don't care then you could give it a zero basically," details Chris Rudder, one of the site's founders.  "So the match percentage is actually really simple.  There's not like calculus or anything." And whether it's virtually online, through "OKCupid," or literally on line, like in a local watering hole, the secret to success is keeping one's foot on the proverbial pedal.  Behind the "OKCupid" curtain, it's revealed that increased activity on the site -- posting photos, regularly checking in -- rewards users.  Meanwhile, at Spurlock's urging, the habitually single Raja steps outside of his comfort zone and buys someone a drink at a bar. "Well that was nice ... there is an interest that is for sure," he reports, furthering the notion that while being overly aggressive will cause you to crash and burn, a squeaky wheel will almost certainly get oiled first.  "I had a real connection." Alas, the road to true love has forever been a complicated one, often full of twists and turns.  But with Morgan Spurlock at the wheel, the latest episode of "Inside Man" (airing Thursday at 9 p.m.) sets out to handle dating detours and lead even the most sour of relationship lemons out of their respective rut.

A Nigerian immigrant is responsible for paying child support for twins conceived through in vitro fertilization with his wife -- even though the procedure took place at least a year after the couple had separated, Massachusetts' highest appeals court has ruled. The court said Tuesday that because the husband, Chukwudera B. Okoli, had originally consented to the artificial insemination procedure, he is now responsible for the payments as the twins' legal and biological parent, according to court documents. Okoli had argued that the agreement should be void because he had consented under duress. He said his ex-wife, Blessing, threatened to obstruct his U.S. citizenship application if he did not consent, the documents said. The two were married in Boston in 1991 and tried unsuccessfully to have children. They were eventually placed on a waiting list for donor eggs to pair with sperm that Okoli had donated. Though they separated in 2000, donor eggs became available in November of the following year. Blessing Okoli then acquired the husband's consent to begin the in vitro procedure at a fertility clinic in Boston. Their twins were born May 12, 2003. Court documents did not indicate Okoli's current immigration status.
Your own hammam, a personal chef and a chauffeur to smooth your way to the slopes -- they're all part of the package for the ultra upper-crust skier. In fact, the après-ski's so tempting at these sumptuous retreats you might be tempted to skip the skiing altogether. Chalet Bella Coola, Verbier, Switzerland If you seek your thrills off-piste as much as on, this is the place: goodies include a hammam for rapid defrosting, a 10-meter heated indoor pool and a Champagne bar. The crisp Swiss air should cure any effects of overindulgence -- and the chalet's setting, sandwiched between the Medran and Savoleyres lift stations, puts you on top of the main network of pistes above Verbier. You could plot your entire day's skiing from the floor-to-ceiling windows, the view extending to that toasty pool.

Where to retire from all the paparazzi, gawkers and generally less fortunate people when you've finished skiing for the day? Prime pick is the ski-in/ski-out Chalet Le Coquelicot. The 10-meter private pool, plus steam and massage rooms should soothe any aching limbs. But it's the lavish extras, including butler and private-jet transfer (if needed), that seal its elite status. If you only had your own private mountain to ski on, too, you wouldn't have to mingle with ordinary people at all.

The tiger skin on the black slate floor and the Harley Davidson in the entrance hall make for a décor that's more rap star cool than classic chalet chic, and if Jay-Z hasn't already checked in he should be given a freebie for promotional purposes. Doubtless he'd appreciate the black-granite surrounds of the "rain shower" in the master suite, plus Jacuzzi and log fire. And if he considered skiing rather than shooting his next video on site, the chalet's mere minutes from the resort of Megève, with 124 slopes -- or 30 mountain restaurants, depending on your preference.

Newcomer Villa Gella might not quite compete with the most exclusive Swiss and French resorts but this is a sweet retreat, nonetheless. Beside the inevitable pool big enough for a neighborhood gym, there are six bedrooms with en suites and piste-view horizontal windows that look like the widest widescreen TVs you can imagine.

Buddy, Teemo, Oscar, Mia, Salty and Molly -- drew attention online and in media reports as owners asked the public for help tracking them down and tried to raise money for the cause. The dog walker at first told police that they'd gone missing after she left them in the vehicle while she was inside a bathroom at the dog park, Canadian public broadcaster CBC reported. She later confessed to private investigators that they'd died in her vehicle. The dog walker admitted she was inside a business for about 45 minutes and left the dogs inside her vehicle, said Alesha MacLellan, a spokeswoman for Petsearchers Canada, a  detective agency brought in by owners to help find missing animals. "The dog walker said she panicked and disposed of the dogs, then made up story about them being stolen," MacLellan said. "After she disposed of the dogs, she drove to a park,  where she was supposed to have taken the dogs originally, and said the dogs were stolen from the park." All six dogs perished from heatstroke, the agency said. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed the dogs' deaths last week and said that they were still investigating, adding that no charges had yet been filed. Prosecutors will have the final say on whether to charge the dog walker, Moriarty said. On a Facebook page and fund-raising site dedicated to the dogs, owners said they were planning to hold memorials for their pets. "These dogs were our worlds and now we are all devastated and heartbroken. I am not sure if we will ever truly mend from this," wrote Jenn Myers Ortner, whose black and white Boston terrier Buddy was among the dogs who perished. "The tears just won't stop."
England opener Alastair Cook just missed out on reaching a remarkable triple- hundred as the hosts continued to turn the screw in the third cricket Test against India at Edgbaston on Friday. Cook scored a career-best 294 as England racked-up a massive first innings total of 710-7 declared on day three, an unbeatable lead of 486 runs with two days play still remaining. And England's position became even stronger when Indian opener Virender Sehwag was caught at slip for his second succesive opening ball duck, as the visitors began their second innings in disastrous fashion. However, in fading light, Gautum Gambhir and Rahul Dravid steered India to 35-1 at the close of play, still needing a mammoth 451 runs to make England bat again. India cannot possibly win the match now, but they will need to bat for the remaining two days to salvage a draw, or hope that some bad weather finds its way to Birmingham. Starting the day on 456-3, in reply to India's score of 224, England continued to plunder runs at will. And, after passing his second-ever Test double century, Cook looked on course to become only the sixth England batsman in history to reach 300, and first since Graham Gooch -- also against India -- in 1990. However, he was caught in the deep, off the bowling of Ishant Sharma, just six runs short of that famous milestone. Cook's marathon innings of 12 hours and 47 minutes fell just half an hour short of the England record, set by Len Hutton, when making 364 against Australia at The Oval in 1938. Their score of 710 was was England's best for 73 years and their third highest of all-time behind the 903-7 declared against Australia at The Oval in 1938 and 849 against the West Indies at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1930. It also leaves them perfectly placed to go an unbeatable 3-0 up in the four-Test series and secure the win that would see them replace India at the top of the Test Championship table.
Tanya Gray, 28, works at a preschool in Florence, where she has lived for the last two years. She first moved to the city seven years ago from her home in Luxemburg, when she and a friend decided to travel to Italy's cultural capital to enroll as students. "Once you have seen the Duomo and some of the old buildings you can't really compare it to anywhere else." While there she fell in love, and over the following years she was either in the city or planning her next trip there. CNN: Hi Tanya. What were your initial impressions on coming to Florence? Tanya: It's a very beautiful city, it's very young and there are always things to do: there's always a party; there's always something going on. And that was very different from Luxemburg for me -- Luxemburg is a very small place and there's not much going on, but in Florence there is so much energy. I was expecting something a lot more like Rome, a lot bigger. Florence is one of those places that is not too big, but it's still a city, so wherever you go you meet different people, it's not that everyone knows everything about you. But it's small enough so that you can walk everywhere. I don't have a car, and walk everywhere. I have been totally immersed in the Florentine way of life: I'm married to a Florentine, I spend all my time with his friends. I didn't even know there was an English-language newspaper in Florence until very recently. CNN: What has made the city so special to you? Tanya: That would have to be all the historic buildings and the architecture, because once you have seen the Duomo and some of the old buildings you can't really compare it to anywhere else. When you see the Duomo, it's breathtaking. And there are various places in the city, such as the Piazzale Michelangelo, from where you can see the whole of the city, and it's beautiful. You can just spend ages there, especially if you are an art enthusiast. CNN: If Florence were a person, what would they be like? Tanya: They would be a really fun, enthusiastic, very lively and cheerful person. CNN: Is Florence a stylish place? Tanya: Yes, of course. All the Italians kit themselves out when they go around the center of Florence, everyone is wearing the latest fashion -- even the mothers of 50- and 60-years old have all got them. You get taken along with the current, even though in the beginning you think, "No, I'm not going to be like them, I'm not." But in the end you just get taken along with the flow. Otherwise you just feel underdressed. A lot of American students who come to Florence -- and there are lots and lots of students in the center, most of whom are American -- are a lot less dressy than the Italians, and the Italians can spot them a mile away. CNN: Is it hard to find places away from the tourists? Tanya: Oh no. The center is very touristy, but if you travel about a kilometer outside of the center it is actually hard to find someone to who speaks English. I live about three kilometers from the center of the city and round there it's really tough to find someone who speaks English. You walk into a bakery and everything has to be said in Italian. Also, some of the clubs 10 minutes' drive from the center are a lot less touristy than the clubs in the center. CNN: Where do you shop? Tanya: Obviously there are lots of shops in the city, but there are also lots of markets, and many people shop at them. I definitely shop at markets because the shops in town are so much more expensive, especially for clothes. And they're not just in the center, they're also on the outskirts as well, which tend to be cheaper, because the ones in the center can rip you off if you're a tourist, or if you look like one. CNN: Could you describe a typical Florentine's weekend? Tanya: On Saturday morning they would go for a walk into town and have a look at all the shops in the center. And then the Italians are very fond of aperitifs before they go out, and lots of the bars have these aperitifs put out. One of the bars in town is called Slowly and a lot of people go there and have their cocktail and their little things to eat, sausage rolls, crisps and all the different little things. Then they would go onto a club, a really good one is called Otel, it's in the south of Florence, a ten minute drive from the center, and it's a really nice club. You can have dinner, watch a show with comedians, live singing and dancing, and then it turns into a club after about 12.30. On Sundays, lots of the Italian people, if it's nice weather, like to go for a drive in the Chianti region: it's beautiful. They might stop for lunch in one of these very quaint little restaurants. If it's terrible weather they can go to the big shopping center, which is called Gilli. Sunday nights are very popular nights to have an aperitif, as well. It's a big student town, and Thursday night is a big night to go out as well. Well, in the city center any night you can find people going out. There is constantly something going on. .................................. Where have you found the "real" Florence? Do you agree with Tanya?

so why choose to open up to CPA Australia? Malley thinks he knows the answer. "I knew something a lot of people didn't know about Neil Armstrong -- his dad was an auditor," said Malley in the first of the four part interview with Armstrong posted on the CPA website. In the 45-minute interview Commander Armstrong discussed his childhood in Ohio, walking on the moon, and what it's like to sleep on a spaceship. Armstrong also recounts the moment he got the call to ask him if his crew were ready to land on the moon. "The bosses asked, 'Do you think you and your guys are ready?" Armstrong recalled. "I said it'd be nice to have another month, but we're in a race here and we had to take the opportunity when we had it. I had to say we are ready, we are ready to go." "I thought we had a 90% chance of getting back safely to Earth on that flight, but only a 50-50 chance of making a successful landing on the first attempt." Armstrong also details the crew's harrowing 12-minute descent to the moon, when he realized that the Eagle lunar module's auto-pilot was preparing to land the crew on the slope of a huge moon crater. "The computer showed us where it intended to land, and it was a very bad location, on the side of a large crater about 100-150m in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders -- not a good place to land at all," he said. Armstrong took over the craft manually and managed to land it like a helicopter in a smoother area to the west with just 20 seconds of fuel left. "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed," were Armstrong's words to mission control on earth. As for "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong says he didn't think of those immortal words until after they'd landed safely. The first few moments when Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the Eagle and onto the surface of the moon were tender, he remembers. "We recognized that we wouldn't have been there if it hadn't been for our competitors in the Soviet Union -- it was a competition that made both of our programs able to do what we achieved. We put medallions for our fallen colleagues on both sides, and that was a tender moment." Armstrong laughed off the conspiracy theorists who believe the 1969 moon landing was faked, telling CPA Australia's Malley that "800,000 staff at NASA couldn't possibly keep a secret." "People love conspiracy theories, but it was never a concern to me -- because I know one day someone's going to go fly back up there and pick up that camera I left," he said. As for the future direction of space travel, Armstrong worries about cuts to NASA's budget, and says the space program remains an important source of motivation for young Americans. NASA's 2013 budget for the exploration of Mars was cut by 38%, and the budget for planetary exploration overall was reduced by $300 million -- a major concern, according to Armstrong. "NASA's been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achive, and it's sad that we are turning the program in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation it provides to young people."

Giants players Jacquian Williams and Devin Thomas made sportsmanship a prime topic for discussion when they said after their NFC championship win against the 49ers that they targeted punt returner Kyle Williams, who has suffered four concussions. Jacquian Williams said of Kyle Williams during a locker room interview: "We knew he had four concussions, so that was our biggest thing, to take him out of the game." Thomas told the Star-Ledger in Newark, New Jersey, that Kyle Williams was a target because "he's had a lot of concussions. We were just like, 'We gotta put a hit on that guy.' ... " The significance of these comments is compounded by the fact that concussions, and the health and safety issues related to them, have become a main concern of the National Football League and its players. Former players are suing the NFL over concussion issues and will appear in court this week. Major rule changes and an elaborate fine system have been implemented to protect players. Former players suffer psychologically and neurologically, and we now know it's because of concussions and subconcussive blows to the head. Boast of targeting punt returner raises questions about concussions Unfortunately, the words of these two young men aren't the first examples of dishonorable behavior and the ignoble mentality that exist in sports, nor will they be the last. It's time, however, for everyone to realize how dysfunctional and unnecessary this type of behavior is. I know all too well that there are some contemptible and devious minds who intend to "take players out." In my nine-year NFL career, knees were cut, elbows were thrown, helmets were used as missiles, ankles were twisted, and I was even bitten! All of these acts were instigated by an insatiable desire to taste victory, even if it meant disabling the opposition to do so. During the weekly scouting report, there was always a special presentation about which players on the opposing team had injuries. The message was obvious. We knew exactly who was hurting and where. If an ankle was injured, we knew which one. If it was a rib, we knew which side of the body it was on. "Take him out of the game." That was the MO. Sad, I know, but in the sports world, c'est la vie. Some say football is a violent game and all the rule changes to protect players are making the game soft. They say go play a different sport if you can't take the big hits. I say to all the uneducated players, wannabe players, couch potatoes and pundits in suits chirping from cozy air-conditioned rooms, many of whom have never played the game: This doesn't affect you. Your long-term health isn't at risk, nor will your kids risk losing you prematurely to a death caused by a psychological and neurological disorder acquired from repetitive head trauma. Do you want to hear something that is really scary? According to the NFL Players Association, the average life expectancy of an NFL player is 58 years. That is considerably lower then the 76-year life expectancy of the average American. Knowing this, should we not attempt to play the game fairly and with respect for our fellow man? Four-time Pro Bowl safety Dave Duerson committed suicide last February. He killed himself with a gunshot to the chest instead of the head, presumably so that his brain could be examined by Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. The New York Times reported that Duerson also sent text messages to family members asking "that his brain be examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy," a condition linked to more than a dozen deceased NFL players. Researchers said his brain had developed the same trauma-induced disease recently found in other deceased players. The number of retired NFL players found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy is growing. Duerson, who complained to his family of his deteriorating mental state during his final months, is the first to act upon his suspicion of having the disease. So, was it wrong for the Giants players to target a man's head when they knew he had already suffered four documented concussions? I'd say yes. Those who display this type of behavior and intent must be reprimanded and punished. Players in the NFL are now fined for helmet-to-helmet contact, so it makes sense that targeting someone who has suffered four concussions and having the intent to "take him out of the game" would be fineable, also. In sports, or business, people always look for a competitive edge. Whether that edge is physical, mental or psychological, the great ones always seek it. It's what separates the mighty from the mundane. It's why some people get up early to put in work while others continue to sleep. It's why some people stay in the gym, at the office, or study for an exam while everyone else goes home. There is such a thing, however, as taking it too far. When getting the upper hand causes another person bodily harm, it has gone too far. Not only are you threatening someone's livelihood, you're threatening their long-term health, their life. Even though the rules may not be written yet, they should be understood. I hope that Jacquian Williams and Devin Thomas were just carried away by the moment. My hope is that they now realize that the extent and potential outcomes of their intentions are frightening. They have tremendous talent and opportunity, and there is no reason for them to harm others on their journey to success. I wish them nothing but the best. Those two men, and all of us, are more powerful than we know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Coy Wire.
All that texting and social networking by teenagers could come back to byte them. A new study by the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine links poor health behaviors -- including smoking, drinking and sexual activity -- to hypertexting and hypernetworking. The study defines hypertexting as sending more than 120 messages per school day. Hypernetworking is spending more than three hours per school day on social network sites like Facebook, it said. "The startling results of this study suggest that when left unchecked texting and other widely popular methods of staying connected can have dangerous health effects on teenagers," said Scott Frank, lead researcher on the study.  "This should be a wake-up call for parents to not only help their children stay safe by not texting and driving, but by discouraging excessive use of the cell phone or social websites in general." Teenagers are "spending really an excessive amount of time online," he added later during a CNN interview.  By doing so, they are contributing to "high-tech peer pressure." Hypertexting was reported by nearly 20 percent of the Midwestern teens surveyed, according to the study. According to the study, teens who are hypertexters are: -- two times more likely to have tried alcohol -- nearly 3.5 times more likely to have had sex -- 40 percent more likely to have tried cigarettes -- 41 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs -- 43 percent more likely to be binge drinkers -- 55 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight -- 90 percent more likely to report four or more sexual partners Hypernetworking was less pervasive, at 11.5 percent, but still associated with a similar list of maladies, the study found. According to the research, these teens are: -- 60 percent more likely to report four or more sexual partners -- 62 percent more likely to have tried cigarettes -- 69 percent more likely to be binge drinkers -- 69 percent more likely to have had sex -- 79 percent more likely to have tried alcohol -- 84 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs -- 94 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight Frank noted that minorities, children of parents with less education, and teenagers from homes without a father are more likely to engage in hypertexting and hypernetworking.  He also cautioned, however, that the study "does not demonstrate cause and effect." "We are not saying texting causes these behaviors," he stressed.  "We can recognize that these kinds of connections ... may be facilitating or enabling these kinds of behaviors, but we certainly can't think of (the online connections) as causing them." Nevertheless, researchers say the results of the study are so striking that they are giving rise to a new health risk category for the age group. The study is not the first time texting and social networking have come under fire.  The activities have been blamed for accidents and promoting bad grammar skills. In January, federal safety regulators proposed a set of guidelines for states to create laws that would ban text messaging while driving. Under the proposed guidelines, drivers caught typing on a handheld device while behind the wheel would face a minimum fine of $75 and unspecified action against their driving privileges. In cases resulting in serious injury or death, a driving while texting offense could be considered a felony. A ban on texting behind the wheel has already been enacted in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Seven states have banned the use of all handheld devices while driving. And educators have long decried electronic forms of communication for gutting written language skills in students, starting with e-mails, expanding to instant messaging and continuing with text messaging and social networking. But it should be noted that teachers also complained about poor grammar before the internet came to be. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report
U.S. health officials said Wednesday they have found a contaminant in a blood-thinning drug produced by Baxter Healthcare Corp. that has been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. The drug can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins, arteries, and lungs. In early February, the Food and Drug Administration launched an investigation and then a recall of some forms of the product. The scrutiny began after a spike in reports of health problems associated with heparin, a drug made by Baxter from pig intestines at plants in China and Wisconsin. Though the cause of the problems has not been determined, FDA investigators found "a heparin-like compound -- that is not heparin -- present in some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients" in both facilities, said Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The contaminant, which made up 5 percent to 20 percent of each sample tested, "reacts like heparin in some of the conventional tests used for heparin," which explains why it was not picked up, she told reporters in a conference call. No causal link between the contaminant and the adverse events has been established yet, Woodcock said. She added that it was not clear whether the contaminant was added accidentally, as part of the processing or deliberately. It also was not clear whether the contaminant was introduced in the company's plant in Wisconsin or the one in China, Woodcock said. Though she said the exact structure of the contaminant has not been identified, "it is similar to heparin glycans." Glycans are polysaccharides, a complex class of carbohydrate. She added it was unclear whether other heparin products used outside the United States might also contain the product. Later this week, the agency will release recommendations on how manufacturers and regulators can screen for the contaminant, she said. Last year, pet food made in China was found to be tainted with an ingredient that replaced more expensive protein and that initial tests did not identify as a contaminant. Asked if the heparin contamination could be a similar case, Woodcock said, "It's possible." Doctors have used the blood-thinner for 60 years with "no history of any problems whatsoever," said the FDA commissioner, Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach. Its intravenous use can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins, arteries and lungs. Von Eschenbach said it would be "disingenuous" to expect the agency would be able to inspect "every institution in every case." Over the last fiscal year, the agency reported having inspected more than 1,000 foreign plants, a record. Since the agency issued its report that 19 deaths had been linked to the drug since January 1, 2007, it has received word of another 27 deaths, "but many of those do not fit our definition of this type of event," Woodcock said. In all, the FDA has received 785 heparin-linked reports of adverse events -- including difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and plummeting blood pressure that can lead to life-threatening shock. "They're continuing to come in fairly rapidly because there has been a lot of reporting of this," she said. In a written statement, Baxter said its tests have suggested "that the root cause may be associated with the crude heparin, sourced from China, or from the subsequent processing of that product before it reaches Baxter." Meanwhile, Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC, which supplies the company with the active pharmaceutical ingredients, issued a statement saying it is working with the FDA, Baxter and outside experts to identify the cause of the adverse events. "Thus far, no conclusions have been reached about the root cause," it said. "It is premature to conclude that the heparin active pharmaceutical ingredient sourced from China and provided by SPL to Baxter is responsible for these adverse events." It said that its voluntary recall of suspect product was being made as a precaution.  E-mail to a friend
Texas authorities are urging residents not to cross into the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo during the Fourth of July weekend because of intelligence that a Mexican drug cartel plans to target U.S. citizens. The violent Zetas drug cartel, which operates in Nuevo Laredo, will be targeting crimes at Americans who cross the border into the city this weekend, the Texas Department of Public Safety and Webb County Sheriff's Office said Saturday. "According to the information we have received, the Zetas are planning a possible surge in criminal activity, such as robberies, extortions, car-jackings and vehicle theft, specifically against U.S. citizens," DPS Director Steven McCraw said in a statement. "We urge U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Nuevo Laredo this weekend if it can be avoided." Nuevo Laredo is across the border from Laredo, Texas, a city which bills itself as the "Gateway to Mexico." Four international bridges link Texas and Mexico at Laredo. An average of 11,000 trucks cross the border daily on those bridges. Besides, commerce, the bridges between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo also connect families who have relatives on both sides of the border. Nuevo Laredo, like most Mexican border cities, offers rows of bars, inexpensive dentists, restaurants and cultural events to draw tourists. But tourism has sharply declined in the past six years as drug cartel violence has spiraled in Mexico. Because of the various bridges into the United States and access to a major highway, Nuevo Laredo has been a turf contested by rival drug cartels. The Zetas are known for having expanded their activities in the area from drug trafficking to exortion, kidnapping and human smuggling. While the officials put out a warning for travel to Nuevo Laredo, they said there is no indication that this cartel criminal spree will crossover into the United States. Officials in Nuevo Laredo said they were not familiar with the Texas warning. "We are on alert as usual, because that is how we must be in Nuevo Laredo, but there is no special alert here with regards to what the U.S. authorities in Texas are saying," said Michelle Jones-Salazar, spokeswoman for the state's public prosecutor's office in Nuevo Laredo. "This week, there has not been a single gun battle that we have had to respond to or a single dead body. The city continues as usual and we remain vigilant." CNN's Mariano Castillo and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.
Yet another passenger ship could be about to anchor in Hong Kong's popular waters, but berths aboard this particular vessel will be more permanent. New sketches from a company in the city on China's southern coast have proposed the creation of a floating cemetery. Designed as a possible solution to Hong Kong's shortage building space -- particularly for graveyards - Bread Studio has come up with "Floating Eternity." The structure would hold a rotating wall of 370,000 niches which are compartments allotted for people to place their urn containing the remains of their loved ones. Designed like a cruise ship, the floating cemetery would anchor along Hong Kong's coastline, docking at a designated pier for visitors who want to visit their deceased relatives. "Architects are always made to think about life when designing buildings but not many think about death," said Benny Lee, a designer at Bread Studio. "I was watching TV and saw a group of people encouraged by the government to scatter their loved ones' ashes in the sea and noticed that the boat they were using to transport people out was really small. I thought why not make that boat bigger, better and more enjoyable for families." "Floating Eternity" would also offer amenities for its visitors. Complementing Chinese rituals that involve bringing food during cemetery visits, the floating cemetery plans to have a grass deck for people to set up picnics or a restaurant onboard. This would be particularly popular during the city's Cheung Yeung and Ching Ming Festival, where many Hong Kong residents pay homage to their deceased ancestors by spending their day at cemeteries. "The design also focuses on plenty of greenery with bamboo gardens; something you don't see in the stony graveyards in Hong Kong despite them being chiseled into hills because there's simply no space," said Lee. The structure is also eco-conscious -- its columbarium wall, which would sit on a rail track, would be powered by tidal energy. This allows the walls to travel around the track giving all niches an equal chance for the best position on the cruise; an important aspect of feng shui - the art of placement prominent in Chinese culture - where the position of the lot affects the price for it. The concept is bizarre yet, it gives Hong Kong a glimpse into its near future. With its bay of glitzy skyscrapers and a population of over 7.1 million, space to build is increasingly scarce, and developers are being pushed out of packed central locations. Recently, a CBRE Global Research and Consulting survey named Hong Kong the world's most expensive retail space at US$3,863 per sf annum, topping New York. Hong Kong also has an aging population. According to the Hong Kong Consensus and Statistics Department in late July, the number of deaths is expected to rise from about 42,700 per year currently to about 82,400 at the end of the next 20 years. A shortage of space coupled with a rise in death rates has caused a shortage of plot space for the deceased and a subsequent rise in costs for it. "A floating cemetery is the next natural step in Hong Kong's history of graveyards," said Lee. Cemetery sites have been evolving since the 1940s where the dead were buried in graves on flat land to the 1960s where feng shui dictated that some graves should be positioned on high hillsides near villages. Towards the 1980s, columbarium became the preferred place for the dead. Traditionally housed in temples, they offer locker-style compartments for people to place the ashes of their loved ones. Columbarium also took the form of buildings however, in recent years, people have objected to living in such close proximity to them and their rising prices (private columbaria costs in Hong Kong range between US$645 to US$25,604). As a result, illegal columbaria have mushroomed in various areas around Hong Kong. A maritime mortuary is yet to set sail along a coastline in any part of the world. However, there have been other unusual options for storing the dead. In Sweden, it is legal to freeze bodies in a posthumous bath of liquid nitrogen before blasting them and reducing them to powder. In Tokyo, Japan, mechanical tombs are used where families swipe smart cards to lift the urns from an underground vault and access the ashes of their loved ones; a solution Hong Kong was reportedly looking into three years ago. "We're aware that the wall of columbarium on the floating cemetery will also, at some point, reach its limit so we suggest stacking up additional storeys on top of the wall," said Lee. "But most importantly, it's a short-term alternative. Who knows, we could be seeing a sea of floating cemeteries in a few years from now." World's 'most delightful commute' hit by ferry disaster
Hours after losing Victoria Azarenka to injury, organizers of the Dubai Tennis Championships were dealt another major blow on Wednesday when Serena Williams also pulled out of the event. The 31-year-old Williams, who became the oldest women's tennis player to be crowned world No. 1 on Monday, said she was forced out because of a back injury. "I've just had some back problems the past couple of weeks," the American told an impromptu press conference. "I thought it would get better as the week went on but it didn't. I don't want to keep pushing it and make it worse." Williams took to the court to apologize to fans who had arrived for her second-round match with Marion Bartoli of France. The absences of both Williams and previous No. 1 Azarenka represent a severe dent to a popular $2 million tournament which had already been without the sport's two reported highest earners, Maria Sharapova and Li Na (according to Forbes magazine). It is also a blow to the Women's Tennis Association, which has worked hard to introduce incentives and regulations to reduce the number of withdrawals from its events. Wednesday's unexpected withdrawal follows that of second-ranked Azarenka, which ensured that Williams will hang on to top spot until the Sony Ericsson Open, which starts in Miami on March 18. Williams said her back also troubled her in last week's Qatar Open, where she was beaten in the final by the Belorussian, who withdrew from the Dubai championships with a foot injury. The 15-time grand slam winner added that, having returned to the pinnacle after two and a half years during which her life and career were threatened following a freak foot injury in 2010, being No. 1 is no longer her primary goal. "OK, I have done it, let's focus on my next goals which are the grand slams," Williams said, admitting that she already had at least half an eye on the French Open in Paris, starting on May 26. "I really want to continue doing really well in those." After winning Wimbledon and the US Open last year, Williams' total of grand slam titles is only three fewer than Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who together are second on the all-time list behind Steffi Graf with 22. Williams' absence increases the chances of world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska making a successful defense of her title, which began with the Pole grinding out a 7-, 6-3 win over Yulia Putintseva, a promising 18-year-old wild card entry from Kazakhstan. Bartoli, who received a wild-card invite after making a late entry, will face former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals. The Dane, now ranked 10th and a winner of the tournament in 2011, progressed with a 6-0 6-1 drubbing of China's former Wimbledon semifinalist Zheng Jie. .
"Oil Rocks" is a piece of history. Azerbaijan's "city in the sea" is the site of the world's first offshore oil well. One hundred and twenty kilometers out into the Caspian Sea, it's still actually within the capital Baku's city limits. Built in 1949, in Soviet times, Oil Rocks is a huge feat of human engineering. Three hundred kilometers of roads, 256 individual oil wells: this is no small operation. Two thousand people live and work here every day, working on a one-week shift rotation. Catering to the needs of its citizens, it even has its own museum and restaurants. Oil Rocks was the world's first attempt to tap into offshore reserves, buried beneath the water. Stalin commissioned the project, before going on to develop Russia's Siberian oil operations. One drilling platform after another was built and linked up with piers, the foundations formed by sinking ships 1,000 meters to the seabed. Flying there by helicopter, a thin film of oil over the water is visible -- evidence of the biggest industry in the Caspian Sea region: hydrocarbons. Local oil and gas reserves have been exploited over the years by the Persians, the Ottomans, the Soviets and now Azerbaijan itself. In Azerbaijan the oil has been flowing for centuries. In 1900, half of the world's production of crude oil came from this corner of the former Soviet Union. This country is now a transit point for energy exports from the whole Caspian Sea region. Oil Rocks is a fascinating link in the chain of eastern supply and western demand. Today the site is operated by SOCAR, Azerbaijan's state oil company. A new well was drilled just this month. Over 60 years after it was built and Oil Rocks is still producing oil and gas, still contributing to the Azeri economy.
Borussia Dortmund took a giant stride towards defending their Bundesliga title with a 1-0 win over Bayern Munich Wednesday in a top of the table clash. The priceless victory left Dortmund six points clear of their Bavarian rivals with only four games left of the German league season. Polish international striker Robert Lewandowski scored the vital goal, his 20th of a fine season, in the second half. He helped home Kevin Grosskreutz's shot on 77 minutes, but there was still drama to come. Only four minutes were left when Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller brought down Bayern's winger Arjen Robben in the penalty area. The Dutch star decided to take the penalty, but saw Borussia captain Weidenfeller save his effort to be mobbed by his teammates. Robben then compounded his error by shooting over from a great position and in a frantic finish Lewandowski hit the crossbar at the other end. "That was thrilling at the end, the last few minutes were unbelievable," Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp told AFP. His side have gone 24 games without defeat to hold off a resurgent Bayern, who face Real Madrid next Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal. Bayern and Dortmund will also contest the German Cup final on May 12. Meanwhile, third placed Schalke suffered a shock 4-1 defeat at Nuremberg which leaves them six points behind Bayern ahead of their clash with Dortmund at the weekend. In Serie A, Juventus went back on top as Alessandro Del Piero scored the winner in a 2-1 win over Lazio in Turin. The victory lifted them one point clear of AC Milan, who had briefly gone top with a 1-0 win at Chievo Tuesday. Simone Pepe put Juve ahead before Stefano Mauri equalized in a rare Lazio attack. Juve continued to press but it needed a typical piece of magic from Del Piero to grab the clinching goal from a clever free-kick with eight minutes left. In other action, Inter Milan maintained new coach Andrea Stramaccioni's unbeaten start with a 2-1 win over Siena with Diego Milito scoring twice. Inter drew level on points with Napoli, who were beaten 3-1 at home to Atalanta, for the final Europa League spot.
Diego Milito scored the only goal as Inter beat Milan 1-0 in the San Siro derby, a result that threw open the Italian Serie A title race after the top three teams all failed to win on Sunday. After leaders Juventus and third-placed Udinese both struggled in earlier matches, defending champions Milan knew victory over their city rivals in the evening kick-off would send them two points clear at the top of the table. And Milan nearly took the lead on the stroke of halftime when Mark van Bommel's strike crashed against the crossbar with goalkeeper Julio Cesar well beaten. Who are football's top January transfer targets? Inter made the most of that stroke of good fortune and Argentine forward Milito scored the only goal nine minutes after the break. Milan defender Ignazio Abate slipped as he attempted to clear Javier Zanetti's cross and Milito was on hand to stroke the ball home. Inter's victory consolidated fifth place, but just six points separate the top five teams after 18 games. The defeat left Milan a point behind Juventus, who remained top and unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at home to mid-table Cagliari. A superb team move resulted in striker Mirko Vucinic tapping home the opener for Juve after just seven minutes, but the Sardinian visitors leveled early in the second half through Andrea Cossu's long-range strike. Udinese dropped two points behind Milan after slipping to a 3-2 defeat at Genoa. Damiano Ferronetti headed Udinese into the lead but quick-fire goals from Andreas Granqvist and Bosko Jankovic gave Genoa the advantage early in the second half. Rodrigo Palacio added a third before Antonio Di Natale pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Genoa captain Marco Rossi had been sent off. Goals from Brazilian midfielder Hernanes and veteran Germany striker Miroslav Klose gave Lazio a 2-0 home win over Atalanta, putting the Rome club five points behind Juve in fourth position.
Timothy Bradley says he needs to beat Manny Pacquiao for a second time in Las Vegas on Saturday to move on from the controversial conclusion of their first fight two years ago. The WBO welterweight champion won a contentious points decision when the pair met in June 2012, inflicting a first defeat on Pacquiao in seven years. Boxing commentators roundly criticized the result while former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis said the scoring showed that boxing had lost its integrity. Bradley claims he subsequently received death threats and that he was unfairly targeted by fans and the media alike for the decision of the ringside judges. "It would mean the world to me to get this victory for me and my family because of everything we went through in the past," the 30-year old told CNN's Don Riddell. "It was like I stole something from the world that night. All I did was do my job. People ridiculed me, demonized me." Bradley insists these dark experiences made him stronger as a person and will act as the perfect motivation ahead of the MGM Grand rematch. He questioned Pacquiao's hunger at the pre-fight press conference Thursday, suggesting the legendary Filipino's best days are behind him. Pacquiao has won world titles at seven weight divisions in a career stretching 18 years but has lost two of his last three fights. "What really motivates me for this fight is what my opponent said," Pacquiao countered in riposte to Bradley's claims. "He said I don't have the killer instinct any more, I don't have the aggressiveness any more. This helps me, it helps a lot." Although he recorded a comfortable victory over Brandon Rios last November, Pacquiao was knocked out for the first time since 1999 by Juan Manuel Marquez in his previous bout. At 35, it would be difficult for Pacquiao to resurrect his career at the very highest level if defeated by Bradley for a second time but he refuses to entertain this notion ahead of the contest. "My mind is set in the winners side not on the losers side," he said. "I always think positive and not negative." "This fight on Saturday will be to prove that my journey in boxing will continue and I'm excited for that."
If you're cursing at work, be careful. While it's commonplace to curse once in a while and may even help you build a bond with co-workers, there's a fine line to when and how you curse. "We are being judged constantly by our co-workers for how we do our work and how we interact with them," says etiquette expert Cynthia Lett. "Cursing is an aggressive and hostile way of expressing oneself." Companies where employees are constantly in front of customers are especially harsh when it comes to foul language -- employees caught cursing can be in trouble. Not sure where you stand when it comes to cursing? Here's how foul language at work can impact your career: Reveal an unprofessional attitude In some professions cursing is accepted and can even help you fit in to an environment, perhaps in high-pressure jobs where everyone needs to let off some steam. Constantly using foul language, however, can make it difficult to fit into a professional environment, says Jennifer Kahnweiler, author of "The Introverted Leader: Building on Your Quiet Strength." "Perceptions are important in shaping your career -- you don't want to be seen as that foul-mouthed person," she says. Be especially careful about your language when surrounded by several co-workers at once -- such as during meetings or when working in teams. Prevent real communication Using curse words over and over again can prevent you from truly communicating what you're trying to say. Instead of cursing, take the time to figure out how to let your co-workers understand what you're really thinking. Even if you're angry or upset, take time to develop a professional communication strategy. "Cursing is an aggressive and hostile way of expressing one's self," Lett says. Furthermore it can create a distance between you and the others in your department because it makes others uncomfortable. "When people are uncomfortable around someone they avoid them whenever possible," she explains. Hamper your image Similar to a disheveled appearance or tardiness, foul language can impact the way you're perceived by others in the workplace. Even if you do great work, cursing can have an impact on your ability to get promoted or get better job responsibilities. "You need to be aware of how you present yourself to your co-workers, superiors and clients," says Suzanne Lucas, a writer and human resources expert. "Swearing when books get dropped on your toes or the copier dies on you is one thing, peppering your daily conversation with expletives is another." Repercussions from human resources Just because no one in your department comments on your use of foul language, doesn't mean it's going unnoticed. In some instances it can be reported to human resources with an official warning. Sometimes it can even get you fired. "Someone who works customer facing [roles] -- such as retail or sales or call centers -- would be fired for swearing, as it's not appropriate with a customer," Lucas says. Of course not everyone gets fired. And as you evaluate your behavior, cursing once in a while is no cause for alarm. "We all get angry and frustrated and using a curse word can be the best release available," says Kahnweiler. "Just be aware that this language shouldn't become your M.O. or you could be seen as lacking self control." &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

Actor Mark Harmon, who stars on the television show "NCIS," appears in a new public service announcement aimed at increasing awareness about cancer immunotherapy, or mobilizing one's own immune system to fight cancer. The PSA, from Stand Up to Cancer and the Cancer Research Institute, debuted Thursday. Harmon participated in the announcement on behalf of friends who have battled cancer. "Cancer research is extremely important to me," the two-time Emmy nominee said in a statement. "I don't know anyone who hasn't been affected by cancer in some way or another. I'm here ... to highlight the unbelievable work that CRI and SU2C are doing to advance the field of cancer immunology." New drugs may help immune system fight cancer Immunotherapy treatments involve drugs that train the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Two new studies presented last month at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference -- the largest convergence of cancer experts worldwide -- involving immunotherapy showed what society President Dr. Sandra Swain called "significant progress." Similar studies were presented at the 2012 meeting. In December, SU2C and the Cancer Research Institute announced that they were forming a Cancer Immunology Translational Research Dream Team to explore the relationship between cancer and the immune system, using $10 million in funding over three years. Scientists on the "dream team" represent eight institutions nationwide. "The research that CRI and SU2C are doing shows us that with the help of immunotherapy, our bodies' own natural defenses can fight cancer," Harmon said. "We've all seen people suffer through different kinds of treatments for this disease, but these advances in immunotherapy have the potential to significantly change cancer treatment as we know it. It's important for people to learn about these discoveries." Stand Up 2 Cancer: A glitzy way to fight
I had been wrestling with eye redness for weeks. After trying nearly every brand of over-the-counter eyedrops available, I finally decided to see a doctor. A handful of tests later, the doctor told me he had no idea why my eyes were red. But that didn't stop him from giving me a prescription. It was odd he would assign a treatment without a diagnosis, but what choice did I have? Visine was not getting this red out, and well, he is a doctor. So I paid the co-pay and bought the prescription. After it ran out and I still had red eyes, I went to visit another doctor. He also ran a couple of tests. He also had no idea why my eyes were red. He also gave me a prescription. Hundreds of dollars spent, and yet I still have no answers or clearer eyes. But I do have an appointment with a third doctor and an allergist. I'm not sharing this story to complain. I'm sharing because if you know the average American makes only $33,000 a year -- which, adjusted for inflation, has not changed since 1988 -- or if you know the price of COBRA for a family of four, then you also know why a lot of Americans don't even bother to get on this hamster wheel. They can't afford to do it. Medicine is not an exact science; I get that. But what I don't get is what middle-class and working-poor people are supposed to do as they ricochet helplessly between doctors without getting answers -- like pinballs in a business model that thrives on people trying to find out what's wrong. How do you keep from getting cynical when you know managing an illness is more profitable than curing it or that leaner cuts of meat and organic produce are more expensive than fattier cuts and produce sprayed with chemicals? Nearly one in four children in the United States lives in poverty, and the World Health Organization reports a direct correlation between socioeconomic status and health. So why is the conversation about health, and specifically, health care reform, so toxic? And so politicized? President Theodore Roosevelt said, "No country can be strong whose people are poor and sick." Yet the promise each GOP candidate has made is to repeal what he or she calls "Obamacare," with no alternative. Are we meant to pretend the impetus behind the law no longer exists because there's a new sheriff in town? To even call health care reform "Obamacare" redirects the conversation away from the most important point: The correlation between socioeconomic status and the mortality rate. Obama doesn't need health care. He and his wife ,Michelle, and their children have access to the best health care on the planet. The same is true for his well-heeled challengers, such as Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Mitt Romney, as well as many of the people in Congress who are fortunate enough to be in the top 10 % of the nation's earners. They all have access to outstanding health care. But what about you? When was the last time you've been to the dentist? You see, despite the rhetoric, the need for health care reform was not discovered by President Barack Obama in 2009. It did not come from Hillary Clinton in 1992. Each president, going back as far as Teddy Roosevelt, has talked about the need to address access to and administration of health care. They understood a healthy population is the lifeblood of a country. Any politician who is touting repeal without offering something significant in its place is not only incapable of connecting the dots, but is out of touch with the kind of sacrifices people make in their health decisions every day. Things such as ignoring reoccurring pains and unusual growths because they can't afford the doctor visit or even the prescription co-pay. This week, CBS' "60 Minutes" aired a riveting story about homeless families living in cars in central Florida. One untouched topic was the health of the parents. I wondered what would happen to those children if their parents were to succumb to an illness? Would they end up in the state system? If so, who do you think pays for that? It's all connected, and a true leader sees that. Mississippi is the the poorest state in the country. It is also the unhealthiest. Most of the 10 poorest states are among the 10 unhealthiest states. They also tend to vote Republican. Don't get mad at me; I'm just the messenger. The question is: What are GOP candidates saying when they promise to repeal health care reform but are silent on health care and poverty? The health care reform plan is not perfect. But the Constitution wasn't perfect either, which is why we have amendments. The best thing for the national dialogue is to point out what's good about the plan so we have something to build on. In nearly 80 years of the White House talking about health care reform, we finally have something. And we need it. Promising to repeal the whole thing might be good for the polls, but what does it do for the people? Because I can promise you, any new president who repeals the law will still have access to the best health care available. That is not true for all of the people who voted that president in.

Every war veteran has stories. They can be shocking, harrowing, tragic -- sometimes even funny. The problem for families trying to understand those experiences, on Veterans Day and every day, is that they won't hear much about them. Many vets have trouble talking about them. This was the case with my father, who saw lots of action as an artilleryman in the Philippines during World War II. When I was a kid, I'd beg him for tales about the war. Usually, he waved me away. Sometimes, though, he gave in to my badgering. I found it strange that most of his accounts were short on the blood and guts bravado that my G.I. Joe comic books had led me to expect. Mostly, they were about men who simply wanted to do their job and go home, but found themselves subject to the deadly coin toss of war. Like today's soldiers recovering from injuries, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or haunted by images of fallen friends, he soon learned after returning home that he couldn't explain war to a civilian. He would carry this alone. "There's no way anyone who wasn't there could understand," he would say. He shook his head telling about the time he had been relieved of duty at a forward observation post. Moments after he walked away, an enemy shell hit the site. It obliterated everyone there, including the friend who had just taken his place. He was lucky in war. I think that bothered him, too. His unit saw 187 days of active battle, but his only injury came when his leg was peppered with shrapnel during an assault. Gangrene set in. Doctors told him the leg had to come off or he could die. He refused to let the doctors operate, and they reluctantly respected his wishes. Then a new "wonder drug" arrived. It was the first batch of penicillin to reach the Philippines, and his life was saved. Why was he spared and others not? Again, he couldn't explain. One day, he heard that an acquaintance -- a kid from his hometown in Missouri -- had been killed in a nearby conflict. He drove to the battlefield to search for the body, but most of the dead were too disfigured to be recognized. Finally, he gave up. He couldn't understand why he had wanted to find him. Or, what he would have done if he had. "Really, I didn't even know him," he told me. At some point during those evenings, he would stop and turn his head. I knew he was finished then, and I would wander off, leaving him to his distant world. Years later, as a reporter, I wrote a series of articles about WWII veterans. Each had his own accounts of exploits and escapes. Like Dad, they usually had to be coaxed into talking. Often, the interviews astounded members of their own family who were hearing the stories for the first time. Like many veterans today, the war never left my father. For years, he suffered bouts of malaria from his time in the South Pacific. His wounded leg sometimes gave him trouble. He regretted not signing up for disability pay while getting his discharge. But the line of injured vets was too long for him to wait. He wanted to get home to a bride he hadn't seen in 3Â½ years. And a 4-year-old son he'd never met. My father respected the sentiment behind Veterans Day, but it wasn't an observance he enjoyed. Dad became a successful businessman in a small Midwestern town after the war and, each year, the Veterans Day parade filed past his storefront. He never joined it, or added his voice to the cheering crowd. While everyone else saw the ranks of veterans parading past, he saw the wartime buddies who weren't there. So, he simply watched grim-faced until it was over. Then he went back inside and tried to forget all over again. Join us Facebook/CNNOpinion.

Confusion and then an uneasy calm. That's how residents up and down the East Coast described their reaction to the 5.8-magnitude earthquake that rattled millions of people Tuesday. The quake, which struck at 1:51 p.m., was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep. The epicenter was about 40 miles northwest of Richmond, Virginia, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It sent tremors throughout the region, surprising people at least as far away as New York, Ohio and Georgia. Sarah Merz said her co-worker in Camden, New Jersey, was the first one to notice the rumbling. "She said, 'What is that? Is it a train?' Everyone kind of started looking at each other. Everyone's eyes just kind of widened, and we all just ran to the front door." People stood stunned outside for a few minutes, she said. "All of the sudden your heart starts to pound because you know on the East Coast, this just doesn't happen. It made me nervous at first, but then at the same time it's kind of this crazy curiosity." Even an hour after the quake, Merz, 28, said she still felt dizzy. "You're like, wait, am I moving? You keep second-guessing yourself. ... You start thinking too much. You're like, is it happening again?" When she sat down at her desk, Merz noticed her framed college diploma was still vibrating on the wall. Stories like hers poured in from across the East Coast as residents, generally not used to earthquakes, struggled in the early moments of the temblor to understand what was happening. Was is a helicopter? A truck? A train? Kate Duddy was in an office building elevator in Manhattan, alone, when the shaking started. "I have never felt a quake before. It was scary having no idea what the cause was," she said. "I felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes." Gabby Randle, 23, was in a meeting in an office building at New York Avenue and 15th Street in Washington. "We could see a couple of things falling off of the building next to us," she said. "We sort of ran because the ceiling tiles were swaying." An official who works in a federal building in New York said he thought someone was "playing a joke" on him when his desk started shaking. "And then," he said "I felt my whole body swaying and realized it was something much more." Many buildings were evacuated in the U.S. capital, where huge crowds lined the streets as police cars sped by with sirens sounding. CNN iReporter Susan Prahinski sent CNN images of her home office in Washington. The quake knocked shelves off her walls and sent books and her computer monitor crashing. A statue of the Greek philosopher Aristotle lost its head. In Spotsylvania, Virginia, Tish Walker said she grabbed her dog and raced outside when the earthquake struck. "I used to live in California, so I know shaking and this felt big," she said. "My first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us." Courtney Thompson, a CNN iReporter from Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey, had no doubt it was a quake, either. The question for her was whether it had occurred out in the ocean. She said everyone taking in the sun at Ortley Beach, New Jersey, sprang up at the same time and looked anxiously out to the Atlantic. "The water did not recede (a telltale sign of an impending tsunami), but I'm sure that's what everyone was worried about," she said. "People started panicking. They didn't tell us we had to get off the beach, but I'm telling you, everyone got right off the beach." Brendan Wein, a sales representative at Hoffman Nursery near Rougemont, North Carolina, said he first sensed rattling inside the building. "We were thinking it was a helicopter," Wein said. "I was literally shaking in my chair." Simon Griffiths, in Raleigh, North Carolina, compared the quake to a tractor-trailer truck roaring outside his house. Billy Wray said his guitars are OK, but things felt pretty weird when the bank building that houses his music shop in Mechanicsville, Pennsylvania, started to sway. "Over here, we were rocking and rolling," he said. CNN iReporter Jeff Yapalater said he was in his backyard in New York's Long Island when the shaking started. "Suddenly I felt this light swaying of the earth, I'd never felt that before, so I thought maybe I was experiencing vertigo for a moment, and it lasted maybe 30 seconds. ... We're feeling this really far away!" he wrote. CNN's Susan Candiotti came across a couple waiting to get back into an evacuated courthouse, where they had been waiting to be married when the quake struck. "I didn't feel the shaking at all," the groom said. He glanced over to his fiancee and joked, "Maybe it's a sign." CNN's Philip Gast, Katy Byron, Brian Walker and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.
Latinos in the United States are divided over a host of issues, including what to do about unauthorized immigrants, a reflection of the national political controversy over illegal immigration, a national study released Thursday finds. Slightly more than half of the nation's Hispanics say illegal immigrants should pay a small fine but not be deported, according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center. Another 28 percent of the Latino respondents to the Pew poll say unauthorized immigrants should not be punished. On the other side, 13 percent say they should be deported. Explainer: Illegal immigration 101 Latinos also are feeling increased concerns about discrimination, again the result of the national controversy over illegal immigration, the survey found. This year, 61 percent of Latinos say discrimination is a "major problem," an increase from the 54 percent who categorized it that way in 2007, Pew said. "Asked to state the most important factor leading to discrimination, a plurality of 36 percent now cites immigration status, up from a minority of 23 percent who said the same in 2007," the report states. "Back then, a plurality of respondents -- 46 percent -- identified language skills as the biggest cause of discrimination against Hispanics." In addition, the Pew report says, Latinos are divided about the impact of illegal immigration on Hispanics living in the United States. "Roughly equal shares say the impact has been positive (29 percent), negative (31 percent) or made no difference (30 percent)," the report says. "This mixed judgment stands in sharp contrast to views that Latinos expressed on this subject in 2007. Back then, fully half (50 percent) of Latinos said the impact was positive, while just 20 percent said it was negative." The latest survey also finds that Latinos are divided over whether immigrant and native-born Hispanics are working together to achieve common political goals. About half (45 percent) say they are and about half (46 percent) say they are not. Both the native born (who comprise 47 percent of the adult Latino population) and the foreign born (who comprise 53 percent) are roughly equally divided on their perceptions of political solidarity, Pew said. "The native born and foreign born have different views on many topics explored in the survey," the report says. "For example, seven in 10 (70 percent) foreign-born Latinos say discrimination against Hispanics is a major problem preventing Latinos from succeeding in America. Less than half (49 percent) of the native born agree. "And when it comes to their views of immigrants, fewer than seven in 10 native-born Hispanics say immigrants strengthen the country, while 85 percent of immigrant Hispanics say the same." Although the survey found differences of opinion among Latinos, it also revealed areas of broad agreement. For example, Pew said, 86 percent of Latinos support providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants if they pass background checks, pay a fine and have jobs. That level of support surpasses the 68 percent of the general public who favor such a path to citizenship, Pew said. Among Latinos, 82 percent of the native born and 90 percent of the foreign born say they support providing that path. Latinos also are united in their opposition to Arizona's SB 1070, a controversial law enacted this year that authorizes police to check the immigration status of anyone who is being investigated for another suspected crime. According to Pew, 79 percent of Latinos oppose the measure, most of which has been stayed pending a lawsuit by the federal government. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found this year that the general population supports the law by a 2-to-1 ratio. With regard to rising concerns about a backlash triggered by illegal immigration, the Pew survey found no increase over past years in the percentage of Latinos who report that they or someone they know have been targets of discrimination or have been stopped by authorities and asked about their immigration status. About one-third of all Latinos (34 percent) say they, a member of their family or a close friend have experienced discrimination in the past five years because of their race or ethnic group, Pew said. That amount is largely unchanged from 2009, when it stood at 32 percent. Perhaps even more significantly, only 5 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status, down from 9 percent in 2008. Despite the immigration controversy, Pew also found that Latinos are more satisfied this year with the direction of the United States. Thirty-six percent said they are satisfied, a significant increase over the 25 percent who said the same thing in 2008. By contrast, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press in a late summer survey found 25 percent of the general public satisfied with the country's direction. Latinos also remain as upbeat about their lives as they were three years ago, Pew said, with 24 percent rating it as "excellent" and 45 percent as "good." About 80 percent on the nation's estimated 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants are of Hispanic origin. Latinos are the nation's largest minority. The 47 million Hispanics in the United States make up nearly 15 percent of the nation's population. About 38 percent of the nation's Latinos are immigrants. Of those, about 19 percent are unauthorized. The study results come from a new national survey of 1,375 Latino adults conducted by land line and cellular telephones in English and Spanish from August 17 through September 19, Pew said. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for the full sample and larger for subgroups.

It is part of the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan institute based in Washington that is funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia-based public charity.
an average of more than three people every day. The report, compiled by the Mexican think tank Citizen Council for Public Security, Justice and Peace, compared intentional homicide statistics around the world in 2012. The report does not include cities in the Middle East. The sunny beach resort of Acapulco in Mexico ranked second on the group's list, followed by the Venezuelan capital of Caracas. New Orleans is the murder capital of the United States, according to the report, which ranked the city 17th on the list. Detroit, St. Louis, Baltimore and Oakland were the other U.S. cities to make the list. Central America's bloody drug problem San Pedro Sula's challenge, experts say, is that Mexico's offensive against drug cartels and the active U.S. deportation of criminal immigrants are pushing the problem south. Some of this criminal element has ended up in Honduras, where, like most Central American countries, law enforcement has few resources to fight it. But city residents say that "murder capital of the world" is an undeserved label that is hurting local businesses. There are only three morgues in Honduras, and one of them is in San Pedro Sula. Residents say that people who are murdered elsewhere and then taken to the city's morgue are being grouped into the city's crime statistics. "All of the crimes that happen in northern Honduras are registered as happening here," businessman Luis Larach said. "So what we businessmen are doing is an accurate count to determine where crime or violent deaths originate so that the information is truthful." The National Autonomous University of Honduras said that only people murdered in San Pedro Sula were tallied in the group's report -- and that in fact the actual murder rate in the city is even higher. The authors of the report defended their research on the group's website, writing: It "is not the ranking that damages the image of the city but the violence and the government's inability to contain and reduce it. To hide the problems never solves them." Honduras is far from the only country in the region with a murder problem. The top 10 -- and 39 of 50 overall -- most violent cities on the list are Latin American. Authorities have launched Operation Lightning in San Pedro Sula, saturating violence hotspots with police and soldiers, and some residents believe the beefed-up security is working. "There's more security now," said local resident Nicolle Valladares. "And that gives us peace." Unfortunately, at least so far, the measures seem to have had little impact on the murder rate.
the Environmental Protection Agency long claimed it was safe -- and whether the illnesses could be linked to the attack site. In January 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Zadroga Act, named after New York Police Detective James Zadroga, who died of a respiratory illness after working at the World Trade Center site. The law sets aside money for medical care and $2.775 billion dollars to compensate claimants for lost wages and other damages related to the illnesses. The money has yet to be dispersed, although lawyers and government officials involved in handling the claims expect payments to some who developed respiratory, digestive and other conditions to begin in the next couple of months. Triple-amputee veteran gets 'smart' home on September 11 Cancer was initially rejected for coverage under the Zadroga Act, but that decision was reversed earlier this year. On Monday, federal health authorities outlined the 58 types of cancer that will be included. "I think it is way far overdue as far as being added on," Vallebuona said. "Common sense alone tells you that cancer was all along linked."  He went on to list several other police officers he worked with who had gotten cancer. "What are the odds with all of these people coming down with the same type of, the same exact type of cancer or a linked cancer?" he asked. He said early in his career at the NYPD, he would hear about one case of cancer a year. "Now it's like ... too numerous to even count." The decision to include cancer has added another layer of complexity to the law's implementation, Kushlefsky said. For one thing, it's possible that some people will not be diagnosed with cancer until years down the road, creating challenges for determining whether the cancer originated because of work at ground zero.  More immediately, adding cancer will undoubtedly mean the $2.775 billion dollars set aside for compensation will be exhausted before everyone is taken care of, meaning that Congress will have to step in to provide additional funds. Kushlefsky is confident that will happen. "I would be shocked if the federal government decided somebody was sick from being down there, has been damaged in a certain amount, and then decided that they're only going to pay a fraction of it," he said. "I mean, it's pretty obvious that at some point the government's going to have no choice but to fully fund this for all covered illnesses." Vallebuona, now retired from the NYPD, is grateful his cancer is in remission and a little unsure about whether any money will ever come through. "You know, it's really an unknown," he said. "I'm not sure what it holds. It's been something they've been talking about for 10 years now, and it's always this little carrot dangling." And if the money does come through, Vallebuona has no idea how much he could get. "I'm not even thinking about that," he said. "If I can recoup what I lost alone in terms of co-payments and parking garage bills, I will be a happy man." 58 cancers receive 9/11 fund coverage
Check with your airline before you head to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport today. No, really. Airlines had canceled more than 3,200 flights within, into or out of the United States shortly before 10 p.m. ET, according to FlightAware.com. And many of those canceled flights involve the world's busiest -- but not the snowiest -- airport. The last time the Atlanta airport used its four snow plows to actually plow snow was the great snow storm of January 2011, said airport spokesman Reese McCranie. The airport also has six snow brooms, four de-icers, seven spreaders, 100,000 gallons of de-icing fluids, 50,000 pounds of de-icing solid material and 50,000 pounds of a salt/sand mix to clear roadways. Related: Deep freeze slams Deep South As this latest winter storm crosses the country, flights at the Atlanta, Houston and Chicago airports have been the hardest hit by cancellations. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta is reporting 930 flights canceled, Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport is reporting 696 flights canceled and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport is reporting 548 flights canceled. The numbers of arriving and departing flights canceled are expected to increase. "Some planes are getting de-iced ... and we're also putting preventative de-icing material on the (five) runways," said Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport spokeswoman Darian Ward. The airport has shut down an above-ground train that ferries passengers between terminals. Instead, passengers are being asked to ride buses. Airport operations may return to normal soon if it warms up today, Ward said. #ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport Chicago's O'Hare has been hit by airlines that are proactively canceling flights. O'Hare -- an airport with a bit of experience with snow removal -- reports only 15-minute delays for arrivals and departures. "Our snow operations teams are out and doing their jobs," said Karen Pride, Chicago's Department of Aviation spokeswoman. Cleveland weather isn't slowing down most flights, either. Thirty percent of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport's Tuesday flights -- mostly smaller aircraft -- have been canceled. "This is due to airline pull downs (reductions because of bad weather in other locations) and not because of weather," said airport spokeswoman Jacqueline Mayo. Call your airline to change your flight Many airlines with flights departing and arriving at hardest-hit cities are offering flexible change policies for delayed customers. Check your airline website for more information. Delta Air Lines canceled more than 1,800 Delta and Delta Connection flights Tuesday, the vast majority at its Atlanta hub, said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant. The nasty weather forced American Airlines to cancel about 350 flights Tuesday, mostly regional flights across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, an airline spokesman said. While declining to give specific numbers, United Airlines is "reducing operations at Houston Intercontinental Airport and other airports in the mid-South and Southeast regions today due to severe weather," said spokesman Charles Hobart, Tuesday. Citing near-record lows in the Midwest, United is also reducing operations Tuesday at their Chicago and Cleveland hubs and other Midwest airports. Make sure to confirm flights Wednesday Depending on how-hard hit they are, Houston and Atlanta airports may still be recovering from storm conditions on Wednesday, said David Baker, FlightAware's chief executive officer. The Chicago and Cleveland airports could also face delays, depending on weather conditions in those Midwest cities. And what about your Amazon delivery? Severe winter may also affect the delivery of your packages. Remember how winter storms slowed pre-Christmas deliveries? FedEx, which is posting service alerts on its website, has already warned customers that hazardous conditions in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas may cause delays in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and 12 other states. UPS is reporting "severe weather impacts" in some of its delivery areas, according to company spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg. Check UPS.com to see which zip codes are affected. "We make every effort to maintain service as long as safety permits," she wrote, via email. "If deliveries are interrupted, we will resume service as soon as it is safe to do so."
well before he made campaign-style stop in Starkville Mississippi, on Wednesday that kept the national press scrutinizing his every statement for any hints about his political future. He shook hands and took selfies with young voters, attacked Hillary Clinton in a high profile speech, and laid out his thoughts about foreign and domestic policy—all signs that suggested he was gearing up for a third presidential bid. But a closer look at the day's events—and the benefit of hindsight—reveal some clues that Romney knew at the time he wouldn't be throwing his hat in the ring. He talked more about the past than the future Speaking at Mississippi State University, Romney spent the first half of his speech talking almost entirely about his 2012 campaign when he was the Republican nominee. Many of the light-hearted and funny moments in the speech occurred while Romney used self-deprecating humor to describe the last presidential cycle. "You may not have heard: I lost," Romney said towards the beginning of his speech. He drew a big laugh from the audience when he said a supporter once advised him to stop shaving so he can "grow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy." "As if I needed that," Romney continued flatly. He lovingly recalled people he met on the campaign trail, labeling some of his most devoted followers in Iowa and New Hampshire "heroes" because they adamantly supported someone they believed in. He described the campaign as one of "the most remarkable of my life's journeys" but spoke with a tone of finality when recalling that it would eventually come to an end. "What we knew at the beginning was that win or lose, any acclaim would eventually be forgotten," he said. "As the 1940s song Jimmy Durante used to sing: 'Fame if you win it, comes and goes in a minute.'" Granted, it's a line he has used in previous speeches, but it's an example of how he was in a reflective mood. He declined to answer a question from the moderator about how he would run a potential campaign differently from 2012—"That's another question I won't answer"—and went on to talk about how Republicans should do better at having a "clear and compelling message," especially when talking to nontraditional GOP voters, like minorities and young people. He even suggested that Republicans have "to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election." That's pretty bold—if not daring—talk for a potential candidate. Jeb Bush, for example, got hammered in the conservative media for making a similar suggestion back in December. Romney appeared to sound more like he was angling to become a kingmaker than a candidate. He continually referred to a need for "strong leaders" and "leadership" but didn't narrow down his remarks to talk rhetorically about a single leader. His policy ideas were vague It was on that very topic—minority outreach—that political observers were most closely trying to examine Romney's recent statements and comments. He won only 6% of the African American vote and 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012. Speaking to the Republican National Committee earlier this month, Romney suggested the party needed to focus more on anti-poverty policies, and in his speech on Wednesday he laid out some of his ideas for tackling the issue. But his ideas were vague and lacked the kind of depth that would churn more interest in a potential campaign. He argued that the government, for example, was providing incentives for single mothers to stay on federal assistance and avoid marriage because they could lose their benefits once they became married. "If marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty, then we want to do the opposite," he said. "We want to create incentives for them to get married, not to not get married." He also said K-12 education needs to improve, and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who haven't worked before, but didn't outline specifics. Those come nowhere near close to some of the more serious proposals by his former running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, or by Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul -- who have made efforts to address poverty through criminal justice reform. Mystery and pulled pork Romney was noticeably more relaxed, not only in his speech, but at a barbecue joint he stopped at earlier in the day to meet with voters. He joked with the national reporters following him in the cramped space that there's an "unwritten rule" that politicians shouldn't be photographed while eating. But he continued to eat anyway. "Do you still consider yourself a politician, then?" one reporter asked, to which Romney replied: "You're taking my picture. What can I say?" Another asked if this is "the new Romney," noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras. "I didn't know I had a choice," he shot back, drawing some laughs. A conversation Romney had with Mississippi State football coach Dan Mullen at the table also seemed to provide a window into perhaps some bitter feelings Romney still has about coverage from 2012. In politics, Romney argued, there's too much emphasis on what a person says, rather than what a person does. "It'd be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience and what they've accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on, but it's not," he said. "It's mostly what you say." What you do, Romney told Mullen, "is a lot more important that what you say," noting how a football coach's reputation is almost entirely based on his record. "You could be the sweetest talking person in the world, but unless you got a record, you're in trouble," he said. Still, he was doing a meet-and-greet—in his jeans and a plaid shirt like he used to—and anyone watching him could have walked away thinking this was a "go." The mystery of his barbecue outing--the will he or won't he--was perfectly captured in a response Romney gave to one man who urged him to run again. "You're very kind," Romney replied, patting the man on the arm. "I wish I were there right now, I gotta tell ya." CNN's Steve Brusk contributed to this report.
With "candor comes a measure of vulnerability." Sonia Sotomayor wants readers to know in the first pages of her new memoir that this will be different from other books by members of the Supreme Court. The dynamic story of the first Latina to sit as a justice seeks to inspire by revealing often-painful chapters in her self-described "extraordinary journey": her father's early death from alcoholism; a complex, often distant relationship with her mother; growing up poor in the Bronx projects; self-doubts about her looks, brief failed marriage; and professional path. But her strengths are celebrated, too: self-reliance to the point of giving herself insulin shots at age 7, after being diagnosed with diabetes; her loyalty to a large circle of friends; and vivid pride in her Puerto Rican heritage. "Experience has taught me you cannot value dreams according to the odds of their coming true," she writes in "My Beloved World" (Knopf/Random House). "Their real value is in stirring within us the will to aspire. That will, wherever it finally leads, does at least move you forward." She will speak this week in depth to CNN's Soledad O'Brien and CNN en Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez. ____________ The 58-year-old Sotomayor was named to the high court in 2009 after 17 years as a federal judge in New York. Her autobiography ends as she takes the bench in 1992. The narrative is often hauntingly personal: no legal analyses here. Anyone seeking to glean her views of hot-button political issues like abortion, health care reform, or same-sex marriage will be disappointed. Clarence Thomas speaks in court Some of the most vivid recollections concern her Type 1 diabetes. Sotomayor recounts how she gave herself the shots of out necessity, with her mother gone much of the day at work, and her father's illness causing his hands to tremble. And within her from that early age was a sense of destiny she has struggled at times to shape. When young Sonia was diagnosed in 1962, the prospects of living a full life past her 40s were not good. "I've lived most of my life inescapably aware that it is precious and finite," she writes. "The reality of diabetes always lurked in the back of my mind, and early on I accepted the probability that I would die young." In many ways she considers that decades-long awareness a "gift"-- to persevere, grasp life at its fullest every day. She now manages her illness with ease -- at public events she has been seen giving herself needle shots, with hardly anyone noticing. Sotomayor deals candidly with death, especially her father Juan's spiral from drink, and the effect it had on Sonia's mother especially. The loving daughter recalls the bottles of booze the family later discovered hidden in "Papi's" bedroom, including under the mattress. Her beloved cousin Nelson's early death from AIDS is chronicled. In one amazing scene, she unwittingly drives him in his last weeks to an "appointment." "He asked me to wait, so I sat in the car, parked outside the rundown tenement in Hunts Point (a neighborhood in the Bronx)," she recalls. "Inside he'd been scoring heroin. I wanted to kick myself -- how could anyone, let alone an assistant district attorney who'd seen everything I'd seen, be so naive. I recited that essential lesson of Papi's, simplistic but true: Good people can do bad things, make bad choices. It doesn't make them bad people." Even Sotomayor's long smoking habit -- puffing up to three and a half packs a day -- gets the full unvarnished treatment, especially the difficulties of her quitting. ___________ The other driving narrative in this memoir is her heritage, rich with stories of childhood visits to the island of her parents' birth. She intimately describes the sounds and smells of her Bronx neighborhood too, especially the weekly visits to her paternal grandmother Mercedes -- whom she called Abuelita -- where food, dancing, and poetry readings brought some of the happiest moments of her childhood. Pizza bomber appeal rejected The justice says an innate awareness of larger forces around her often-chaotic childhood helped ground her, leaving the girl more trusting of her own instincts than what her once-distant mother and Catholic school education could provide. Her motto when she was in doubt: "Listen carefully and observe until I figured things out." Young Sonia's evident intelligence and self-determination were boosted by affirmative action, just getting a hold in American society in the early 1970s, when she began applying for college. Sotomayor admits not being fully aware of its impact in her own life at that age, but certain polar memories still leave a bad taste. A fellow Hispanic student criticized her for not being more militant about the discrimination Hispanics were facing, while a high school employee baldly questioned whether as an underprivileged minority she truly deserved to go to Princeton University. "I felt like an alien landing in a different universe," she says of her early college days, relating an experience shared by many of her minority friends. "There were vultures circling, ready to dive when we stumbled. The pressure to succeed was relentless, even if self-imposed out of fear and insecurity." She drove herself hard to overcome that doubt, determined to prove critics wrong. "I had been admitted to the Ivy League through a special door, and I had more ground than most to make up before I was competing with my classmates on an equal footing," she writes. But "to doubt the worth of minority students' achievement when they succeed is really only to present another face of the prejudice that would deny them a chance even to try." The young woman from the Bronx projects graduated with honors from Princeton and later Yale Law School. ____________ Sotomayor is unmarried, has no children, and her laser focus on her work as a prosecutor, private lawyer, and later justice -- she admits somewhat sadly -- has often been at the sacrifice of greater personal growth. She concedes that her intensity and drive has initially turned off some people. Her longtime paralegal developed hives when dealing with the often-brusque new boss for the first time. Sotomayor also overheard a law firm colleague describe her as "one tough bitch" who would not be pushed around by adversaries. "I was shaken to hear myself so harshly categorized," she recalls. "When I'm focused intensely on work, I become oblivious to social cues, or any cues for that matter." Seeing Justice Sotomayor on the high court, zeroing in on a lawyer's presentation at oral argument, is to witness that blend of street-smart manner, combined with a steely intellect. She does not mess around. But in private, her demeanor is another story. When talking with her in small, intimate settings, Sotomayor quickly, easily makes you the sole center of her attention, bringing a warm smile and understanding manner. Being single has also allowed her time to embrace the many dozens of relatives and colleagues -- many of them mentors -- she holds close to her, her "familia." "I've always turned the families of friends into family of my own," she writes proudly. In her newest role, Sotomayor has become an international role model, something she admits can be affecting and overwhelming at the same time. "My education continues on the Supreme Court as I reckon with the particular demands of the finality of review," in the decisions the justice and her eight colleagues issue. She ends her book, "My highest aspiration for my work on the Court is to grow in understanding beyond what I can foresee, beyond any borders visible from this vantage."
Sergio Aguero earned Manchester City a long-awaited title in the final seconds of last season, and his manager hopes that Sunday's stunning effort against Liverpool means the 2012-13 Premier League crown is still a possibility. Second-placed City came from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw, but still ended the weekend nine points behind rivals Manchester United. Aguero netted his ninth league goal this season with a superb piece of skill, beating Pepe Reina to a throughball and then chipping a delightful shot over the goalkeeper from out wide on the right. "Two years ago Chelsea were nine points behind and when they went to play at Old Trafford two games from the end they were only two points behind," City manager Roberto Mancini told reporters. "Two games and the championship is reopened. I don't think this is finished but probably now we have to win all the games but if not then 11 or 12 games. "Last year we recovered eight points in six games so I don't know why it can't happen this year. We have 15 games and United have to play in FA Cup and the Champions League so the season is long -- three months -- and we are confident." Having let Mario Balotelli move to AC Milan, Mancini started with Aguero and Edin Dzeko up front, and it was the Bosnian who broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute with his 11th in the league. Dzeko was also involved in Liverpool's equalizer, as new signing Daniel Sturridge scored his fourth goal in six games despite an apparent foul by teammate Daniel Agger on the City striker. "The referee said to play on -- he said not to kick the ball out," Sturridge revealed. "It is not our job to kick the ball out. If the referee says to kick it out we will do that, and if he says play on then we'll play on. We played on and we scored." Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard put his side head with a stunning volley in the 73rd minute, but Aguero -- whose injury-time goal against Queens Park Rangers in May ended City's 44-year wait for a league title -- embarrassed Reina soon after to leave the visitors in seventh place. "Aguero's finish for the second was unbelievable but from our perspective we are bitterly disappointed he was in that situation," said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. "It was a mistake, everyone is clear on that, but I can't fault the players." Tottenham closed to within a point of third-placed Chelsea with a 1-0 victory at 10-man West Bromwich Albion on Sunday thanks to Gareth Bale's 11th league goal this season. However, it was marred by an ankle injury to striker Jermain Defoe, who will miss England's prestige midweek friendly against Brazil. Ninth-placed West Brom had Goran Popov sent off for spitting just after halftime. "The game changed with the sending-off. I'm absolutely disgusted with Goran's behavior," said his manager Steve Clarke.
Furious anti-Japan protests erupted in Chinese cities Sunday after a Japanese group landed on an island that both countries say is theirs. Protesters toppled Japanese-made cars, burned Japanese flags, and shouted that the island is Chinese territory and that Japan should get out, according to the state-run China Daily newspaper. There were protests in Shenzhen, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Harbin and Qingdao, China Daily reported. In Guangzhou, demonstrators staged a loud sit-in in front of the Japanese consulate, it said. Chinese protesters carried Chinese flags and banners during a march in Hong Kong. The group of 10 Japanese landed on the island Sunday. They waved Japanese flags and draped one over a lighthouse. "As a Japanese citizen, and as a local lawmaker, I went onto the island to show clearly that this is Japan's territory," Eiji Kousaka, a parliament representative from Tokyo, told the Reuters news agency after landing on the island. TIME: Maritime disputes not just about China He said he "had" to go to the island after a group of Chinese nationals landed there Wednesday. Japan arrested 14 of them and deported them Friday. "I can't just shut my eyes and go and just fish," Kousaka told Reuters. The island is part of an uninhabited chain in the East China Sea claimed by both countries. China calls them Diaoyu and Japan calls them Senkaku, and ownership of the islands would allow for exclusive oil, mineral, and fishing rights in surrounding waters. After Japan arrested the Chinese group Wednesday, there were anti-Japan demonstrations in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Beijing. China warned Japan not to allow Sunday's landing, urging it not to "undermine China's territorial sovereignty," according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. The islands have been the center of dispute for decades. Japanese nationalists traveled to the islands in 1990 and 1996. In 2010, tensions rose to a boiling point when a Chinese fishing trawler rammed into a Japan Coast Guard vessel on patrol in the islands' waters. Japan detained the crew members but later released them under Chinese diplomatic and trade pressure. The dispute boils down to where lines can be drawn in the ocean for commercial use. International law allows for a nation to claim exclusive economic rights to fish, oil and mineral reserves up to 200 nautical miles from the shore. One question hanging over territorial claims is whether the disputed islands are islands at all, according to maritime law. If they're not islands, then territorial claims don't apply. Both sides say they have a history of economic use of the islands. China points to a 1893 decree by Dowager Empress Cixi, giving the island to a Chinese medicine-maker for use in cultivating herbs. Japan points to 19th-century use on the island to collect seabird feathers and guano. Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara says a Japanese family claims to own four of the five disputed islands, and that it has documents showing the islands' Japanese ownership dating to 1890. The Wednesday incident coincided with the 67th anniversary of Japan's official World War II surrender. On the same day, two Japanese Cabinet ministers visited the controversial Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which honors Japan's war dead as well as war criminals. China and South Korea, given their respective wartime occupation and colonization by Japan, have condemned such visits. A commentary published by the Japan Times on Friday cited diplomatic experts in Japan as saying both nations would benefit from resolving the dispute quickly, with China facing a leadership change later in the year and Japan facing separate territorial fights with Seoul and Moscow. Adding to the regional tensions before the anniversary was South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's visit Tuesday to what the country calls Dokdo, a small group of islands in the Sea of Japan that Japan claims as Takeshima. The move prompted Japan to recall its ambassador to Seoul and warn South Korea that it will take the issue to the International Court of Justice -- a proposal rejected by Seoul. Japan's finance minister has also said he will cancel a trip to South Korea because of the dispute. Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul said all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945. CNN's Elizabeth Yuan, Ben Brumfield, Kyung Lah and Kevin Voigt contributed to this report.
On a recent afternoon along Church Street in Burlington, Vermont, young aspiring actors recited passages from Shakespeare's Henry V as jugglers, break-dancers, and blowers of didgeridoos displayed their skills nearby, creating a visual and aural cacophony. Just another day in a thriving college town -- this one happening to be home to the University of Vermont. There are notable distinctions between college towns and other American cities. In the student-centric spots, bicycles seem to outnumber cars. Affordable restaurants serve up authentic cuisines from all around the world. The streets are densely packed with businesses, making for a highly pedestrian-friendly environment. Nature is usually accentuated: the shimmering Lake Champlain, backdropped by a sawtooth silhouette of peaks, forms the western edge of Burlington. Madison, Wisconsin, is situated on an isthmus between two lakes that draw hordes of hikers and bikers. Boulder, Colorado, is an outdoor enthusiast's dream. And don't forget the bars. Each of these locales offers plenty of opportunities for imbibing, many of them ideal for both people-watching and soaking in the scenery. It's hard to beat sunset cocktails at Austin's Oasis, where tiered decks jut from a 450-foot-high cliff over Lake Travis. These attractions are mainly geared toward the students, naturally, but they can be readily enjoyed by those with no homework assignments or college connections. After all, few sports experiences can top the rafter-shaking raucousness in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, during a Tar Heels basketball game. Many schools benefit from world-class art collections in glittering facilities designed by marquee architects; Chapel Hill's Ackland Art Museum, featuring a wing by Polshek Partnership, tempts visitors with Warhols, Titians, and Dalís in a way that many university-less cities cannot. The performing arts also abound. Most campuses host an array of dance, theater, and performing arts to rival a season at Lincoln Center. Not to mention rock. This fall, for instance, the Boulder Theater, near the University of Colorado, will host the Psychedelic Furs, Aimee Mann, and Dinosaur Jr. So, as students zip up their backpacks for a return to the classroom, it's a good time for any traveler to pack up a trunk and visit one of these bustling campus locations. Just don't count on peace and quiet if you go to bed early. Oxford, Mississippi (University of Mississippi) On autumn Saturdays when Vaught-Hemingway Stadium is packed with 65,000 whooping fans, it may be tough to associate Oxford with anything but football. But in a place named for a scholarly English city and that is home to William Faulkner's columned retreat, Rowan Oak, paperbacks take precedence over quarterbacks, especially at Square Books. Its tens of thousands of volumes include autographed copies of works by southern authors like Eudora Welty. When not reading, residents pedal the city's fast-growing network of bike trails. "I was surprised to learn Mississippi could be so progressive," says Kevin Stuart of Oxford Bicycle Company. Local taste: Act the southern gentleman on the upstairs porch at City Grocery by ordering a "Just North of South" bourbon mojito. Olympia, Washington (Evergreen State College) State capitals and colleges fit together seamlessly in a number of locales (see Austin and Madison). Olympia nicely mixes buttoned-up government workers and dreadlocked students. It's hard to miss the Capitol Campus -- you can see the legislative building's sandstone dome from almost anywhere in the city. Take a guided tour, and then stroll through the lovely conservatory and gardens. Every Earth Day, the Procession of the Species parade, with participants colorfully dressed as birds, turtles, killer whales and more, weaves through downtown -- near where Harlequin Productions draws theatergoers to its unconventional shows at the State Theater. Local taste: Though vegetarians are plentiful in Olympia, shellfish fans are, too; find them slurping Fanny Bays, from the British Columbia bay of the same name, at the Oyster House. Charlottesville, Virginia (University of Virginia) The music scene was fertile here B.D.M.B -- that is, before the Dave Matthews Band, which formed in Charlottesville in the early 1990s. These days, alternative rock, country, and reggae acts -- as well as, of course, jam bands -- get crowds moving at the Charlottesville Pavilion, the Paramount Theater, and even Scott Stadium, where U2 arrives in October. But the best performances may lurk along the brick sidewalks of the postcard-perfect downtown, in tiny venues like Miller's, a former drugstore that's now known for jazz and blues. When the music's over, be sure to get a good look at the Thomas Jefferson -- planned campus and explore a Blue Ridge Mountain trail. Local taste: Matthews, who was born in Johannesburg, might enjoy the "boerie burgers" at the Shebeen, a South African restaurant. Austin, Texas (University of Texas) Texas's retro-stylish capital prides itself on turning out offbeat characters -- Willie Nelson and Matthew McConaughey, for starters. But for something truly batty, check out the Ann Richards/Congress Avenue Bridge, where 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats hang out -- quite literally. At dusk, from March through October, they flap off to chase insects. Viewed from a lawn below next to Lady Bird Lake, the swarm will blot out the sunset. Austin, the so-called live music capital of the world, turns into a music fanatic's dream each March during the SXSW festival. Local taste: Go for some Texas barbecue at the low-key Artz Rib House, where for $16.99 you can get messy with a full rack of baby-back ribs. Sip alfresco drinks and take in the sunset at Oasis, where tiered decks jut out from a 450-foot-high cliff over Lake Travis. Burlington, Vermont (University of Vermont) College towns don't get more scenic than Burlington, where a 7.5-mile bike path on old railroad beds provides wind-riffled views of Lake Champlain. It's understandable, then, that outdoor activities figure prominently here. Rent a kayak from Umiak to explore bays fringed with pines, or hike Burrow's Trail to the summit of nearby Camel's Hump, whose bald-faced 4,083-foot summit offers living-map panoramas. Local taste: Dine on local delicacies at the Green Room, which offers locavore favorites like Vermont lamb braised with green peppercorns. Boulder, Colorado (University of Colorado) In a town that always pops up on "healthiest cities in America" lists, bike trails are abundant and outdoor options are endless. The Wild West begins along Baseline Road in Boulder, in the foothills of the Rockies known as the Flatirons, for their sharply angled faces. Rent climbing shoes from Neptune Mountaineering, whose in-store museum features dozens of ice axes and an early pair of Rossignol skis. Local taste: The Chautauqua National Historic Landmark, built in the 1800s as a Methodist retreat, now serves up salmon with salsa verde on a wraparound porch. The on-site summer-camp-type cottages provide eagle-eye views toward the flatlands. Berkeley, California (University of California) If coffee shops define a good college town, Berkeley has the competition beat. Some host bands, others show art, many sell fair-trade blends, and most offer a space where it's okay to relax for hours. "It's kind of a universal hangout place, not just for professors and students," says Erik Hvezda, a barista at Brewed Awakening. Many residents prefer the crackle of vinyl to MP3s; pick up some LPs at the well-stocked Amoeba Music on Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley's festive commercial strip. In the heart of campus, the 61-bell carillon provides the tunes atop 307-foot Sather Tower, which also offers stunning panoramas of San Francisco Bay. Local taste: For brunch, fit in with the crunchy crowd by ordering a tofu scramble at Venus. For some local suds, stop in for pints at the festive Pyramid Brewery. Ann Arbor, Michigan (University of Michigan) If a town's name references trees, it's a good bet nature will figure prominently. At the lush, 123-acre Nichols Arboretum, gravel paths wind past blazes of yellow, pink, and white peonies and the occasional reclining student. The "Arb" is also frequently the setting for Shakespeare stagings. Slake your thirst amid more flora at Dominick's, whose garden is ideal for enjoying any of the 10 local microbrews on tap. Local taste: Apart from the various Wolverines sports teams, the pride of Ann Arbor is Zingerman's Roadhouse, where the rooftop vintage neon sign reads "Really Good American Food." And that's what you'll get, of every type, from New Mexican chiles to oysters from Apalachicola, FL. Madison, Wisconsin (University of Wisconsin) Like oases in deserts, college towns in the Midwest can be refreshing splashes of hustle and bustle amid the plains. The Wisconsin capital squeezes cafés, art galleries, and the César Pelli -- designed Madison Museum of Contemporary Art onto an invigorating pedestrian-only thoroughfare. In warm weather, the museum's roof is the setting for concerts and films. Elsewhere are found lively neighborhood block parties, like the Atwood Summerfest, which annually offers rock bands on multiple stages. And there's no shortage of aquatic fun: the city is located on an isthmus between a pair of glittering lakes. Local taste: L'Etoile Restaurant is the region's slow-food mecca. Chapel Hill, North Carolina (University of North Carolina) Yes, there's a fine clutch of Georgian classroom buildings around a shaded, picturesque quad, but during the winter months, everyone's attention is fixated on the Dean Dome, home to the powerhouse Tar Heels basketball team. Come November, tickets that haven't been snapped up by students are available to the public. Die-hards check out the 8,000-square-foot, year-old Carolina Basketball Museum, which doubles as a de facto shrine to alum Michael Jordan (old jerseys included). Still, nothing beats game time, says ticket director John Miller: "It's really just electric." During the off-season, browse for art at Red Window, owned by Elizabeth Edwards, wife of former senator John Edwards. Local taste: Though the building's a flyspeck, the long lines of cars at the drive-through window of the Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen testify to the restaurant's celebrated sweet tea and fried chicken.

Anti-government rebels on Friday continued their march through the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, withstanding an army counterattack to maintain control of the strategically important town of Sake. The town is on the road to Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, and a group of fighters started to march in its direction, journalist Phil Moore told CNN. Moore and U.N. spokesman Kieran Dwyer said the M23 fighters held Sake after two days of battling government troops in the town they first entered Wednesday. The United Nations, which supports the Congolese army, as well as Britain have condemned the rebel campaign intended to overthrow the government. Read more: Rebel leader in Uganda for Congo crisis talks On Friday, the Congolese army was near the town of Minova, about 15 miles south of Sake, according to Moore. Residents fled ahead of M23's progress, Moore said, and a second group of M23 fighters was heading north to the town of Masisi. The fighting continued despite a joint statement Wednesday from the leaders of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda that called for M23 to halt its rebellion and enter talks with the Kinshasa government. Read more: Rebels threaten wider Democratic Republic of Congo conflict "The M23 rebel group must immediately stop its offensive and pull out of Goma," the statement said, adding that the Congo government committed itself to addressing rebel complaints. The latest unrest continues a cycle of violence and misery in Eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. The political leader of M23, Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, flew Thursday to the Ugandan capital of Kampala for talks with President Yoweri Museveni, who is hosting a conference of regional leaders Saturday aimed at ending the crisis in Congo. Dwyer said the Kampala summit, which also will include Congo President Joseph Kabila and Rwandan President Paul Kagame, would be scrutinized for any political impetus to stop the violence on the ground. "There does need to be political solutions to this," he said. "I don't think battlefield solutions are going to be the answer in and of themselves." The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers. Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation. On Tuesday, the rebels gained control of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, though U.N. forces continued to control the airport. At a rally at Goma's stadium, an M23 officer declared the group's military goals. "We will push on to Bukavu, then Kisangani, and finally take Kinshasa and overthrow the government," Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarama said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred, according to a Congolese reporter there. Read more: Can we end rape as tool of war? Mark Simmonds, the UK minister for Africa, arrived in Kigali, Rwanda, on Thursday and immediately issued a statement saying "there can be no attempt to unseat the legitimate government of the Democratic Republic of Congo." He called on the Congolese government to "address the underlying causes of the conflict." "I call on the M23 to stop its advance and to withdraw from Goma immediately," Simmonds said. Oxfam, which is monitoring humanitarian conditions in the area, warned Thursday that the fall of Goma to the rebels poses "a very real risk of complete collapse of state authority and the humanitarian crisis reaching new depths." It estimated that 120,000 people were in urgent need of help, with many sleeping in the open or in schools and other buildings without humanitarian aid. Tens of thousands of Congolese, already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region, have fled camps around the edges of Goma, according to UNICEF and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.

Melting glaciers in the Alps may prompt Italy and Switzerland to redraw their borders near the Matterhorn, according to parliamentary draft legislation being readied in Rome. Glaciers in the Alps near the Matterhorn are receding, forcing the border to be redrawn. Franco Narducci of Italy's opposition Democratic Party is preparing a bill to redefine the frontier with neighboring Switzerland, his office said Wednesday. Narducci is a member of the foreign affairs panel in Italy's lower Chamber of Deputies. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini has authorized the bill. Switzerland also has cooperated with Italy on the matter. The Italian Military Geographic Institute says climate change is responsible for the Alpine glaciers melting. "This draft law is born out the necessity to revise and verify the frontiers given the changes in climate and atmosphere," Narducci said. "The 1941 convention between Italy and Switzerland established as criteria [for border revisions] the ridge [crest] of the glaciers. Following the withdrawal of the glaciers in the Alps, a new criterion has been proposed so that the new border coincides with the rock." The border change only affects uninhabited mountaintop terrain. The deputy excludes the possibility of any family having to change citizenship. The border between Italy and Switzerland was fixed 1861, when Italy became a nation, but it has been occasionally modified, the Military Geographic Institute said. The border was last modified in the 1970s when the Switzerland-Italy highway was built at the Brogeda crossing. The bill is expected to become law by the end of April, Narducci said. Unlike Switzerland, Italy can change its border only with new laws approved by parliament. Narducci said the same negotiation will be proposed to France and Austria "Once upon a time, the border line demarcation between two nations was synonymous to war and bloodshed," he said. "Instead , today we proceed with photograms."
After my short journey home from the hospital with our newborn seven years ago, I hit my first breaking point. Breastfeeding was not going well and so we hired a "lactation expert" to come to my rescue. I viewed my initial inability to breastfeed as nothing short of failure as a mom! For the record, I am a huge proponent of breastfeeding and know there are lots of great and supportive lactation experts and consultants -- but sadly, mine was not one of them. When the lactation guru had me sit in my dining room chair naked from the waist up, and forcefully moved my breast around like a piece of meat to find the exact position for the "latch," I knew this was not the way breastfeeding was supposed to go. I shrieked something to that effect and politely asked her to leave. Oh Kate, I hope that doesn't happen to you, but if it does, know you are not alone. As you bring home your bundle of joy, who also happens to be third in line to the throne, and prepare for your first days as a mom in front of a worldwide audience, we offer you this: real advice from moms on 10 things that could make you slightly crazy during these first magical -- and exhausting -- days. Read on and remember, we've all been there and lived to tell about it! 1. Get used to smelling like... baby spit-up "Gone are the days of fine perfume, at least until you know whether the baby is sensitive to it," said mom of two and Washington blogger Stephanie Dulli, who also warns Kate about the burning sensation she will feel when she hears a baby cry on television. "That's your milk. Breasts don't care if it's your baby or not," she joked. "Hear baby? Fill up!" 2. You still look pregnant If you think right after you give birth, your body will return to normal, you will learn how wrong you are! Kim Como, a Long Island, New York, mom of two and co-host of the blog 2 Moms on a Train, remembers feeling "so thankful" to have her favorite maternity jeans and oversized sweater at the hospital and equally thankful it was just her husband taking a few pictures of their new addition. "At least I could control it a bit," she remembered. "Honey, take pictures waist up!" 3. Beware of the sleep deprivation Amanda Rodriguez, a mom of three from Frederick, Maryland, and host of the blog Dude Mom, said the biggest thing for Kate to worry about is sleep. "Seriously, lack of it will turn you into a zombie faster than you can say royal baby," she joked. "Find a way to sneak it in. Tell Prince William to take the baby on the other side of the palace ... if you have to but make it happen." 4. Check for what under fingernails? Your baby's poop, said Lisa Nee, a mom of three boys from Madison, Connecticut. "I remember going to the grocery store and realizing I had poop under my nails left from a messy midnight changing cycle." Kate, don't freak! Keep reading! 5. Realize breastfeeding takes time and patience Cybele Weisser, a Manhattan mom of two, said what made her insane during her first days as a mom was discovering how much time it took to breastfeed and how hard it was. "On day three, I believe I actually said the words, 'I'd rather be in labor again,'" she told me. Amanda Rodriguez encourages Kate to "do it alone" if she plans to nurse. "Away from the husband and the cameras and the mother-in-law, as lovely as she seems. It's the one time I got to be silent and bond with baby without someone standing there waiting for a turn to hold him," she said. 6. Don't think you're horrible if you can't breastfeed "Not everyone makes a ton of milk and if you don't, don't feel bad about it and get depressed and think you're a horrible mom," said a mother of two who preferred to stay anonymous, remembering how she endured a "never-ending" cycle of breastfeeding, pumping and giving her boys bottles since she couldn't produce enough milk. "If someone had told me that different moms make different amounts of milk, I think I would've fared better after the first baby." 7. Beware of the unsolicited advice We all get it -- from our parents, our in-laws, even well-meaning strangers. The challenge, Kate, will be to smile and keep doing it your way. Shandley McMurray, a Canadian writer and mom of two now living in London, said, "One woman told me to put a hat on my 2-year-old 'before she froze to death.' It was 59 degrees out. Another warned me that my daughter would poke her eye out if I let her use a fork to eat her hot dog," she remembered. "It's a miracle my children are still alive." 8. Be prepared for the ridiculous nicknames No matter what you and William decide to call your son, Kate, your family and friends will have their own ideas about exactly what he should be called. Beth Engelman, a single mom in Chicago and co-founder of Mommy On a Shoestring, said when her 7-year-old son, Jackson Robert, was born, family members started to call him a host of names. "Jacko, Jack-Ro, J Bob and AJ, which is short for Action Jackson, and yes, that ridiculous nickname was created by the baby's dad!," she said, offering this advice to Kate. "Just smile and repeat the baby's real name. You might have to do it 100 times but eventually they'll get the hint." 9. Get William to do his share A prince and heir to the throne changing diapers? Why not, says mom of three Samantha Ettus, founder of Working Moms Lifestyle, who believes sharing parenting duties is the best way to ensure an equal partnership in the raising of a child. She offers this advice to Kate: "In the first week, make an excuse for (William) to be alone with the baby. Find a reason to have to run out and leave him alone with the baby so he has to," Ettus said. "And I always like to say, 'Catch him doing things right' so try not to micromanage him. So long as he's keeping the baby safe, he's doing a great job. Use tons of positive reinforcement." 10. The world will feel like a different place now Becoming a mom, said Sarah Walton, a New Jersey mom of two and founder of Better Way Moms, changed her more than she could ever have imagined. "I can no longer watch any kind of violence. I can't ride roller coasters. ... My disdain for bullies shocks me and the desire to have my child be kind can make my eyes well up with tears," she said. "You will now see the world through the eyes of a mother, and no one can prepare you for that." Finally, Kate, when it's 4 o'clock in the morning, and you can barely keep your eyes open, and you feel close to tears for no reason at all, and you are wondering if you are truly made out to be the mother you hoped you could be, remember this -- relax. "It's going to get easier," said mom of two Maryellen Mooney of Long Island, New York. "Although you feel like you can't catch your breath now, someday, your baby will be putting her own clothes on or fixing himself a snack, and you'll say, 'Where did the time go?'" That's exactly how I feel about that newborn whom I finally figured out how to breastfeed. Seven years later, she's heading into the second grade, her sister into the first grade, and my story about the lactation expert with the poor bedside manner makes me laugh instead of cry.

The Food and Drug Administration has warned a company that markets caffeine and vitamin B as "breathable energy" it could face regulatory action over "false and misleading" labeling. AeroShot comes in a lipstick-shaped dispenser that puffs out the white powdery mixture. Pre-filled devices can be purchased online or in convenience stores in New York and Boston for about $3. AeroShot's website says the product "gives you a higher level of freedom and control that you can only get from airborne energy." However, elsewhere it explains, "the powder in AeroShot reaches your mouth where it is swallowed and ingested." "Your labeling is false and misleading because your product cannot be intended for both inhalation and ingestion," the FDA charges in a letter to the manufacturer Breathable Foods. "Consumers may attempt to inhale your product, causing it to enter the lungs. FDA is concerned about the safety of any such use." The AeroShot packaging says the product is "not recommended for people ... under 18." But the FDA noted that the AeroShot website refers to "hitting the books" and "studying in the library" as activities that presumably could be enhanced by using the product. "These activities are commonly performed by children and adolescents," the letter says. "Indeed, your reference to these activities seems to target this population." The FDA also expressed concern over AeroShot's posting of news clips on its website that refer to the mixing of the product with alcohol as a party drug. "Even though these news items express health concerns about taking AeroShot while drinking alcohol, your posting of the news items on the website where you promote and sell AeroShot publicizes such use," the letter states. "We plan to work closely with the FDA to meet their requests for information and labeling changes to ensure compliance with dietary supplement requirements," Tom Hadfield, CEO of Breathable Foods, said in a statement. "AeroShot delivers a mix of B vitamins and caffeine to the mouth for ingestion and is not 'inhaled' into the lungs. AeroShot is not recommended or marketed to persons under 18 or for use with alcohol." The FDA is giving Breathable Foods 15 working days to respond to the warning letter. "You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited above," the agency said in the letter. "Failure to do so may result in regulatory action without further notice. Such action may include, but is not limited to, seizure or injunction." In February, product inventor David Edwards told CNN it was safe and "thoroughly tested" before it was introduced. "There are energy shots on the market that have 10 times the amount of caffeine in a single energy shot than we have in the AeroShot. ... The fact is we don't have that much caffeine in the product," he said. One AeroShot contains 100 milligrams of caffeine dispensed in three to six "puffs." "For most healthy adults, moderate doses of caffeine -- 200mg to 300mg, or about two to four cups of brewed coffee a day -- aren't harmful," according to The Mayo Clinic. It warns that more than 500-600 milligrams daily can cause problems such as insomnia, elevated heart rate, muscle tremors and stomach upset. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, sent a letter in December urging the FDA to examine the safety and legality of AeroShot. "The bottom line is this product asks more questions than we have answers, and to have it on our shelves before those questions are answered is a serious, serious, serious mistake," he said in a news conference in February. AeroShot falls under FDA regulations for dietary supplements. Those products include vitamin C pills, some weight loss products and certain energy drinks. The company making them is responsible "for determining that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading," according to the FDA website. It's rare for the agency to prohibit a supplement. In 2004, it stopped the sale of the diet supplement Ephedra, but only after deaths and other serious side effects were reported.
Before dawn on Friday, a man wearing an Afghan uniform shot and killed three U.S. soldiers during a meeting to discuss local security issues in the southern province of Helmand. It was one of an unprecedented series of five attacks by people in Afghan security forces uniforms in the past week against NATO forces. If the trend over the past few months continues, NATO troops in Afghanistan face a rapidly growing threat. It is compounded by the strategy of withdrawing all combat troops by the end of 2014, which will increasingly leave relatively isolated international military advisors embedded with Afghan soldiers. Attacks believed to be connected to Afghan security forces have already killed 34 NATO service members this year, drawing close to the record 36 international soldiers killed in similar attacks in 2011, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation. Nineteen of the 34 NATO troops killed this year were U.S. soldiers, while 15 American service members were killed in such attacks in 2011. These attacks now constitute 8% of the total number of U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan this year. In 2011, this number was closer to 4%. The targeting of U.S. and other NATO soldiers by members of the Afghan security forces first spiked in 2009, and the number of incidents has gone up each year since. In Friday's attack in Helmand, three U.S. Special Forces soldiers were killed. An Afghan official told reporters that a commander at a police checkpoint had invited them to a predawn meal and security discussion, where he opened fire on the Americans before fleeing to take refuge with Taliban militants. "Now, he is with us," a Taliban spokesman claimed, identifying the attacker as a police commander named Asadullah who had been helping U.S. forces train Afghan policemen. If this version of events is correct, the attack was premeditated and carefully planned -- likely with the help of the Taliban, who have claimed a role in about half of such attacks -- known as "green-on-blue" incidents -- since the beginning of the war. A NATO military official tells CNN that, in fact, only 11% of such incidents can be definitively attributed to the Taliban. The motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to classify because the perpetrator is either dead or has fled. According to media accounts of such incidents, many of the "green-on-blue" attacks appear to have taken place after an argument between Afghan and international troops, or because of an Afghan soldier's personal grievances. A Department of Defense report in April explains "investigations have determined that a large majority of green-on-blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel." In 2011, U.S. military behavioral scientist Dr. Jeffrey Bordin interviewed more than 600 Afghan soldiers and policemen and found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of Western soldiers. The Afghan security forces aired grievances ranging from NATO soldiers' supposedly indiscriminate fire that killed civilians to the public searching of Afghan soldiers outside NATO bases, as well as U.S. soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their Afghan counterparts. Another likely cause of the increase in the number of green-on-blue incidents is straightforward: In the past two years the size of the Afghan army and police force has almost doubled from around 200,000 to around 350,000. This may also have contributed to a recent spike in the number of Afghan security forces turning their guns on their own Afghan colleagues. According to the NATO military official who spoke with CNN, there were 39 such "green-on-green" incidents last year and already 31 this year. To combat the green-on-blue problem, U.S. and Afghan officials have implemented tighter vetting for Afghan army and police recruits, and now designate one U.S. soldier -- known as a "guardian angel" -- in those U.S Army units working with Afghan security forces whose job is solely to guard against attacks while American forces eat, sleep or exercise, the Associated Press reported. A senior NATO military official tells CNN that the coalition has also increased the number of counterintelligence officers in the field to ferret out Taliban double agents. But once all NATO combat troops have left Afghanistan at the end of 2014 any advisors who will remain will rely entirely on Afghan forces for their security, leaving them acutely vulnerable to green-on-blue attacks.
Former French Ligue One champions Bordeaux have confirmed that they have agreed a deal for coach Laurent Blanc to take over as French national coach from Raymond Domenech after the World Cup finals. After initially expressing anger at the French Football Federation (FFF), for their pursuit of Blanc, Bordeaux confirmed in a statement on Thursday that an agreement had finally been reached for the 44-year-old to take over the position. "The French Football Federation, its president, Jean-Pierre Escalettes and Bordeaux FC, its president and shareholders, have reached an agreement for the recruitment of Laurent Blanc as the coach of the France football team," confirmed the statement. It is not clear how much compensation has been paid by the FFF to entice Blanc, but club president Jean-Louis Triaud had earlier stated on Bordeaux's official Web site: "I have no intention of giving gifts to the FFF." Triaud also revealed that he believed Blanc's head had been turned by the FFF's advances, resulting in Bordeaux's challenge for a second successive French league title collapsing over the second half of the season. He said: "Honestly, I am convinced the federation were making plans before the end of the season. The media frenzy around Laurent Blanc is sure to have disturbed the squad. "The FFF's influence was heavy in the second half of our season. That added to the team's troubles." As a player, Blanc helped France win the World Cup in 1998 and the European Championships two years later. He retired from playing in 2003 and was appointed Bordeaux coach in 2007, leading the side to second place in his first season before securing a superb League One and League Cup double in the 2008-2009 season.
Vladimir Putin's gala address before Russian parliamentarians and officials Tuesday surprised no one when he announced Russia's annexation of Crimea. The interesting part was his distorted view of Russian history, and his proclamation that a bizarre kind of simultaneously aggrieved and aggressive hyper-nationalism is now Russia's official ideology. In discussing Ukraine, however, Putin seemed to go out of his way to suggest he had no aggressive intentions and was not planning to divide the rest of the country. Listening to Putin, one could easily forget that Russia is and for many centuries has been the largest country in the world and that it acquired its territories by imperialist expansion often accompanied by genocide and ethnic cleansing. Instead, Putin prefers to see Russia as having been permanently on the defensive, a victim of both Western and Communist machinations: "In a word, we have all the reasons to believe that the notorious policy of containing Russia, which was pursued in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, is continuing to this day. "They are constantly trying to drive us into some corner, because we have an independent position, because we defend it, and because we call things by their names and are not hypocrites," he said. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, according to Putin, it was the turn of the Bolsheviks to aggrieve Russia. Putin conveniently ignores that the vast majority of Bolsheviks were Russian and that the party Lenin founded was institutionally Russian as well. No matter. Putin says: "The Bolsheviks, for a number of reasons -- may God judge them -- added large sections of the historical South of Russia to the Republic of Ukraine. This was done with no consideration for the ethnic makeup of the population, and today these areas form the southeast of Ukraine. Then, in 1954, a decision was made to transfer Crimean Region to Ukraine. ... What matters now is that this decision was made in clear violation of the constitutional norms that were in place even then." Once again, Putin's historical myopia is breathtaking: Nikita Khrushchev's decision to grant Crimea to Ukraine was as constitutional as anything any Soviet Communist leader did in the entire period of the USSR's existence. The Soviet Union rested on illegality and the systemic violation of human and civil rights. If Khrushchev was wrong, then that's only because the USSR was wrong and should never have been created in the first place. Unsurprisingly, there is no room in this narrative for the nation that Russian imperialism almost managed to annihilate -- the Crimean Tatars. Russia conquered the Crimean Tatar khanate in 1783. Afterward, the Russian authorities forced the Tatars out of their ancestral homeland and replaced them with settlers from Russia. Tens of thousands of Tatars died or were killed; some two-thirds had to leave the Crimea. In 1944, the ethnic cleansing was completed when Stalin expelled the entire Crimean Tatar population -- about 200,000 people -- to Uzbekistan and some other Soviet regions. About half died on the way. It was only in the late 1980s that they began returning to their homeland to find that their land and their homes had been occupied by Russian settlers. Instead, Putin primarily explains why Crimea matters to Russia: "The graves of Russian soldiers whose bravery brought Crimea into the Russian empire are also in Crimea. This is also Sevastopol -- a legendary city with an outstanding history, a fortress that serves as the birthplace of Russia's Black Sea Fleet ... symbolizing Russian military glory and outstanding valor." And what of the Crimean Tatars? Here's Putin: "True, there was a time when Crimean Tatars were treated unfairly, just as a number of other peoples in the USSR. There is only one thing I can say here: Millions of people of various ethnicities suffered during those repressions, and primarily Russians." The mendacity is astounding. The Crimean Tatars were not just "treated unfairly" by some vague force. They were subjected to genocide by a Russian totalitarian empire. Russians also "suffered," but the brunt of the suffering fell, as Yale historian Timothy Snyder describes in "Bloodlands," on Poles and Ukrainians. Despite all this victimization, Putin's speech loudly asserts that Russia is back: It's mad as hell and it won't take being humiliated anymore. This Russia, the new Russia, is both victim and bully: "Today it is imperative to end the hysterics and to renounce the rhetoric of the 'Cold War,' and to recognize an obvious thing: Russia is an independent and active participant in international life, and it has, like other countries, its national interests, which must be acknowledged and respected." And then, remarkably, Putin adopts a conciliatory tone with respect to Ukraine. Naturally, he first denounces the new democratic government as illegitimate and in the thrall of imaginary fascists and asserts Russia's obligation to help defend Russians and Russian speakers from their supposed assaults and predations. Here's the soft and fuzzy Putin: "I appeal to the people of Ukraine. I sincerely want you to understand us: Under no conditions do we wish to bring you harm, to insult your national feelings. We have always respected the territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state. ... "Don't believe those who terrify you with Russia, who shout that other regions will follow Crimea. ... We want Ukraine to be a strong, sovereign and self-sufficient state. ... We want peace and amity to come to the land of Ukraine, and together with other countries we are ready to provide full cooperation and support to that end. But I repeat: Only the citizens of Ukraine are able to bring order to their own home." If these words were sincere, then they may mark a significant departure from the war-mongering rhetoric Putin employed at his March 4 press conference, where he stated he "wasn't worried" by war with Ukraine. Indeed, if sincere, Putin has clearly stated that he will not invade the rest of Ukraine and attempt to annex some of its southeastern provinces. Is Putin being truthful, or is the speech a smoke screen for further aggression? We don't know, of course, but now that Putin has gone on record as having nothing but peaceful intentions toward Ukraine, the international community would do well to remind him of that whenever the temptation to rattle sabers on Ukraine's borders and foment trouble in Ukraine's southeast proves too strong for him to resist.

Mother Nature showed her extremes across the United States on Tuesday, with another day of dangerously hot temperatures broiling the Southwest while parts of the Northeast grapple with flooding from torrential storms. Temperatures across much of the West will soar 10 to 20 degrees above average on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. Forecasters issued excessive heat warnings for large swaths of California, Nevada and Arizona through the Fourth of July. By noon, the mercury had hit 98 degrees at Reno, Nevada; 109 at Las Vegas; 104 at Yuma, Arizona; and 118 in Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley -- where the heat was so intense over the weekend that it melted shoes. Triple-digit forecasts were posted as far north as Spokane, Washington, and the Idaho panhandle. "Many of the same locations that broke records recently could shatter records again on Tuesday," the weather service said. That's dreadful news for much of California, Nevada and Arizona, states that have all seen temperatures top 120 degrees in the past few days. Forecasters in Las Vegas noted that a similar heat wave in 2005 killed 17 people. They urged neighbors and relatives to check on those most susceptible to heat-related illness -- children, the elderly and the chronically ill. "This is a life-threatening heat event for those at risk," the advisory warned. Heat hurts your insides, too Because heat stroke or heat exhaustion can strike within minutes, hundreds of Las Vegas residents have sought relief in a Salvation Army cooling shelter. "Not only do they get (from) the cooling station the benefit of the water that we put out, but they can also take showers, if they need to, in here for free," Andre Ingram of the Salvation Army said. He said anyone who comes in can get as much ice-cold water as they need, when "normally they walk around just looking for it." The extreme heat is hindering efforts to stop Arizona's Yarnell Hill wildfire, which has scorched more than 8,400 acres -- about 13 square miles of land. The fire killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad on Sunday when fierce, erratic winds whipped the fire in different directions. Parched land from Arizona's drought is also fueling the fire. East Coast deluged by rain Much of Arizona would love to get more rain. But residents on the East Coast are seeing too much of a good thing. Showers and storms will stretch from Florida to New England through Thursday, dampening the Independence Day holiday, the National Weather Service said. That's on top of the rainfall that quickly flooded parts of New Jersey on Monday and stranded motorists in Paramus. "I didn't think that was going to happen, but it was up to my knee when I got out of my car," Caroline McCourt told CNN affiliate WABC. Thunderstorms also produced three small tornadoes in Connecticut and New Jersey on Monday, but there were no reported injuries, the weather service and local authorities said. An EF-1 twister with a top estimated wind speed of 86 mph skipped across 2.5 miles of Windsor and East Windsor, Connecticut, knocking down trees and blowing out electrical transformers there, Windsor Locks Police Capt. Chester Degray said. An EF-0 -- which packs winds between 65 mph and 85 mph -- touched down in Greenwich, Connecticut, about 35 miles north of New York, inflicting similar damage, the weather service said. Another EF-0 went through Berkeley Heights, New Providence and Summit, New Jersey, about 15 miles west of Newark. Drivers in Durham, North Carolina, also had to push their cars out of floodwaters on Monday. And the flooding could get worse -- cities from Georgia to New England could see 2 to 3 more inches of rain in the next few days.

President Obama plans to nominate retired Air Force Lt. Gen. James Clapper to be the new director of national intelligence, a senior U.S. defense official confirmed to CNN Friday. Clapper, now a top Pentagon intelligence official, would replace Dennis Blair, who resigned at the end of last month. The announcement will be made Saturday at the White House, the official said. If confirmed, Clapper will become the nation's fourth DNI in the last five years. The position was created after the September 2001 terrorist attacks to oversee the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community. Clapper, who retired from the Air Force in 1995 after a 32-year career, served as head of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency from September 2001 to June 2006. He has served as the under secretary of defense for intelligence since April 2007. Some political observers have indicated that Clapper's prospects for confirmation on Capitol Hill, however, are questionable. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic head of the Senate Intelligence Committe, recently said the "best thing for the U.S. intelligence community is to have someone with a civilian background in charge." The ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committe, Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, said he has reservations about Clapper. "I believe he is too focused on the Defense Department issues and he has tried to block out efforts to give more authority to the DNI," Bond said. Bond's counterpart on the House side, Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, also said he believes Clapper is the wrong person, because he is "not forthcoming, open or transparent" with Congress. Blair, a retired admiral, was pressured to resign as DNI because of differences with the White House over the scope of his role and turf wars with CIA Director Leon Panetta and other members of the intelligence community. One source familiar with Blair's situation said that from the very beginning, "the White House did not have the same view (as Blair) of what the DNI should be." That might be the crux of the problem. The law that created the position of DNI after the 9/11 terrorist attacks is too "ambiguous," said Lee Hamiliton, a former congressman who pushed Congress for intelligence reform. Hamilton, the co-chairman of the 9/11 Commission, recently told a congressional hearing that "the role of the DNI is not clear ... and as long as you have the ambiguity, you're going to have these agencies fighting for jurisdiction and power." The DNI needs to be empowered with the budget and personnel authorities to lead the community, otherwise, the director is merely a coordinator, Hamilton said. Some question whether it is possible to change the law, considering the difficulty Congress had in getting the original agreement. Bond said Congress must act to give the DNI clear budget authority and chain of command within the intelligence community. Feinstein has called on the president to define the DNI role and then work with Congress to make it law. Hamilton said a fix is needed now, that it can't wait for the longer-term legislative correction. Hoekstra says changing the law is not the answer. "If you have great people working together, even in a mediocre structure, they can make things happen. More strengths and authorities in the law doesn't guarantee success," he said. There does seem to be widespread agreement on one needed component: presidential action in support of the DNI. Hamilton said the "burden is on the president now to clarify who is in charge of the intelligence community -- where the final authority lies on the budget, personnel and other matters." Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, recently wrote a letter to Obama urging him "to remove obstacles which may have formed a stumbling block for others who held the DNI position." John Brennan, the president's chief counterterrorism adviser in the White House, recently said the administration is trying to ensure the intelligence community is "integrated well and orchestrated well" by the DNI. "We want to make sure the DNI's role is clear and is able to optimize the contributions that the intelligence community makes on a daily basis," Brennan said.

The long-running conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has claimed hundreds of sexual violence victims in the past two months as women and girls continue to be prime targets of retaliation between rival militias along the country's porous borders, according to aid agencies. At least 657 cases of sexual violence involving women and girls were documented in September and October during mass expulsions from Angola to Congo, according to UNICEF. UNICEF, which compiled the case information over the past two months with help from aid agencies on both sides of the border, said women, girls and possibly men were sexually victimized as about 6,621 Congolese nationals were expelled from Angola. "Many cases of VS [sexual violence] are reported, including torture," according to a UNICEF document obtained by CNN on Saturday. A UNICEF spokesman in Kinshasa, DRC, said there have been 35 confirmed rapes so far as victims undergo medical evaluations in makeshift shelters set up by international aid organizations. The U.N. plans to send a special mission, comprised of representatives from a variety of aid agencies, to the area next week to talk to community leaders, doctors and humanitarian organizations about the allegations, the spokesman said. The Angolan deportations of more Congolese nationals were announced in August 2001, the report said. These mass-expulsions are making civilians more vulnerable to such attacks, the spokesman said. Relations between the DRC and Angola -- once an ally -- have been strained. More than 10,200 Congolese nationals were deported from Angola in January and February of 2010. Several incidents of human rights abuse and sexual violence were reported associated with these expulsions as well, according to the United Nations. Warring insurgent groups, such as the Ugandan-based Lords Resistance Army (LRA) and the Hutu-backed militia known as FDLR, operating in the eastern DRC are a main source for instability in the region, the agency said. Rape has become a weapon of war in the Congolese conflict. The United Nations has named the Democratic Republic of Congo the "rape capital of the world," with 15,000 women raped in eastern Congo last year. The attacks occurred in parts of the country where armed rebel groups moved into areas considered to be pro-government but lacking in army or police protection, according to the U.N. Often dubbed the Great African war, analysts say the conflict in the DRC -- considered Africa's oldest and deadliest war -- has cost the lives of nearly five million people. Nine African nations were involved in the conflict that spilled over from the 1996 Rwandan genocide. CNN's Umaro Djau contributed to this report.
Indian tennis player Sania Mirza has used her Twitter page to thank well-wishers following the announcement of her marriage to Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik. The wedding, which will take place in April, brings together two nuclear powers historically divided by political and sporting rivalry. On Tuesday, the 23-year-old Mirza greeted her 13,205 followers with the message: "Hi Guys! Me & Shoaib are very happy in this new phase of our life.Want to thank the media & all you guys for the wishes. Lots of love to all." Mirza divides opinion in India, drawing criticism from strict Muslim groups for her short tennis skirts and jewellery, while gaining plaudits and fans for her achievements on the court. She became the first Indian to win a WTA Tour title in 2005, reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open later that year and won the Australian Open mixed doubles last year. The announcement of the marriage between the two Muslims comes two months after Mirza broke off her engagement to a childhood friend. "I have been in the constant glare for too long and would appreciate the privacy at this very personal moment in my life," her statement said. Malik, 28, is a former national captain who is currently serving a year-long ban from the Pakistan Cricket Board due to indiscipline on a tour of Australia. He caused controversy in 2007 when, after losing to India in the World Twenty20 final, he thanked Muslims from "all over the world" for their support. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence in 1947.
German authorities have indicted 10 people in connection with a stampede at a music festival that killed 21 people in July 2010. The deadly crush happened at the Love Parade festival in Duisburg. Six city workers and four who worked for the event organizers were charged with involuntary manslaughter and bodily injury caused by negligence, a senior prosecutor said Wednesday. The deadly crush took place between the main event site and an expansion area in an underpass that became a fateful bottleneck. A stampede Faulty crowd flow planning led people both entering and exiting the festival to cram into the underpass from both ends, Michael Schwarz said in a prepared statement. In addition, barriers that were installed without approval hemmed the crowd in, further increasing the congestion. Witnesses told CNN affiliate NTV that the underpass became dangerously overcrowded, and some people who were crushed against the walls and each other lost consciousness. That triggered a panic in the crowd, unleashing a stampede. The Duisburg public prosecutor's office said 652 people were injured. Of them, 283 had to be treated in hospitals. Mass festival Masses of people attended the annual electronica and techno music festival, but there is much disagreement on the size of the crowd. NTV said about 1.4 million people showed up at the Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people, they opened an additional event site. But the numbers are disputed by police, who said that the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 people and that it was not filled to capacity. At the time, NTV said 1,400 police officers were on hand to monitor the event; Detlef von Schmeling of the Duisburg police said more than 4,000 police officers provided security. Witnesses told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. An additional entryway had been opened before the accident to relieve some of the pressure. Immediately after the calamity, the Love Parade's organizers dissolved the festival, vowing never to put it on again. CNN's Diana Magnay and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.
Barcelona notched up the pressure on La Liga leaders Real Madrid with a 4-0 home win over Getafe as Alexis Sanchez scored twice on the day that the Spanish club's defender Eric Abidal had a liver transplant. Tuesday's victory left the defending champions a single point behind their archrivals, who face a testing derby match at Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. It was Barcelona's 10th straight league win, and put Josep Guardiola equal second on the club's all-time La Liga victories list with 112 as coach, matching Frank Rijkaard. Johan Cruyff has the record of 183 wins from 306 games as coach, but Guardiola has the highest winning percentage of 76.8% from 146 league outings, losing only 10 times in four seasons. Guardiola dedicated the victory to Abidal, who had his surgery about a year after having a tumor removed from the same organ.. "We're very pleased to be able to dedicate this victory to Abidal and his cousin Gerard. It's a special day because we knew that he was in surgery," Guardiola said. "We're very pleased because it's never easy against such a defensive team. We found our patience, and we scored fairly early, we created goalscoring chances ... we controlled the match. It's very difficult to attack a team that defends with nine players." Sanchez opened the scoring in the 13th minute after being put through by Lionel Messi. Argentina star Messi got on the scoresheet himself just before halftime with Chile forward Sanchez adding his second in the 73rd minute, while Pedro rounded off the scoring a minute later to complete the rout. Supporters in the Nou Camp paid a special tribute to the 32-year-old Abidal in the 22nd minute of the match -- the same number as his squad shirt. Barcelona announced on March 15 that Abidal would have a liver transplant "in the coming weeks." Last year he made a remarkable recovery from his cancer removal and helped Barcelona lift the European Champions League trophy after beating Manchester United in the final. The France international had made 20 appearances for Barcelona this season before news emerged of his impending operation. In Tuesday's other action, Osasuna consolidated sixth place with a 2-0 win over Espanyol that lifted the Pamplona-based club four points clear of their opponents and Atletico. Real Sociedad drew 1-1 at home to Real Betis, a result which left both teams comfortably clear of the relegation zone.
Parents' prescription-drug use has dangerous implications for kids. A recent study published in the journal Pediatrics shows that the rise in prescription-medication use among U.S. adults has led to more poisonings among children -- despite efforts to prevent that outcome. The phenomenon is so concerning that researchers are advising pediatricians to talk with parents about how to safely store prescription drugs away from kids of all ages. The investigators write that despite public-health interventions like educational campaigns and the introduction of child-resistant medicine bottles, between 2001 and 2008, pediatric emergency-department visits due to medication exposures increased 30%, while the rate of hospitalizations increased 36%. Simultaneously, the number of U.S. adults using prescription medications has also gone up. Researchers decided to explore whether there is a connection between the two. Their findings don't look good for child safety. Research shows that more children are being exposed to medications not intended for them, and that most of these poisonings come from consuming prescription drugs vs. over-the-counter ones. Most of these drug exposures happen in a child's home, from medications belonging to an adult relative. TIME.com: Study: Internet access may increase prescription-drug misuse The researchers looked at two databases and compared monthly pediatric poisonings with the number of adult drug prescriptions from 2000 to 2009. During those years, there was a rise in adult prescriptions for diabetes drugs, statins and other lipid-lowering medications as well as beta-blockers and opioids. They noted a significant association between the rise in adult prescriptions for those drugs -- including hypoglycemics, antihyperlipidemics, b-blockers, and opioids -- and poisonings among children for those specific medications. The strongest link between drugs and emergency-department visits for pediatric poisonings was connected to lipid medications and beta-blockers. Serious injuries and hospitalizations occurred most often for opioids and diabetes medications. Children under age 5 had the highest risk of poisonings, followed by 13- to 19-year-olds. For young kids, medication poisonings are more commonly caused by unintentional consumption, but for teens, it's more likely from recreational use. It's not enough to keep prescription meds out of the reach of young kids; households with teens should be equally mindful of where those drugs are stored to avoid harm and overdose from risky behavior. TIME.com: More kids accidentally ingesting marijuana following new drug policies The authors suggest that although public-health initiatives, like the 2008 Preventing Overdoses and Treatment Exposures Task Force, may be effective, kids are still being exposed at greater levels. "Pediatricians should consult parents of patients on storing medications, focusing on how exposures vary based on the child's age and intention. Physicians prescribing drugs to adults should also be aware of the potential risk of exposures to children and provide guidance accordingly," the authors write. Unfortunately, adult prescription-drug use is unlikely to fall anytime soon, especially given the high obesity rates in the U.S. Many of the drugs specifically implicated in the study, like antihyperlipidemics, oral hypoglycemics and b-blockers, are taken to treat obesity-related conditions. The researchers conclude that based on their findings, there's a growing need for improved interventions for prescription-drug ingestion, including more age-specific prevention strategies.

a long way from Spain. "It's sort of an open question really what this means, and I think further research into the nuclear genome of these hominins will address that," Paabo said. How they did it Paabo and colleagues used a new method for sequencing ancient, degraded genetic material to put together the 400,000-year-old specimen's mitochondrial genome. It is the oldest DNA ever found outside permafrost conditions -- in other words, it was not permanently frozen. "The retrieval of such ancient human DNA is a major technical achievement, and promises further recovery of such material from other fossils in this time range, both in the Sima and elsewhere, where we would not previously have expected it, or looked for it," said Chris Stringer, researcher at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the study. Mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms. DNA stored in the mitochondria is passed to children through the maternal line only (i.e., only moms can pass it on), so it's only a small snapshot of inherited genes. Genetic material in the cell's nucleus comes from both parents and gives a fuller picture of genetic heritage. To study genetics of our ancient predecessors, researchers have an easier time studying mitochondrial DNA because there are hundreds of times more copies of it in each cell. "It's a much bigger chance to find some fragments of this preserved," Paabo said. The method that researchers used involves separating the two strands of the DNA double helix. They then make a "library" from each of the two strands. If part of one strand is damaged, its analogue on the other strand -- which is made of complementary genetic partners -- may be intact. "That is sort of the big trick involved," Paabo said. After sequencing the mitochondrial DNA, researchers then compared the result with genetic information about Neanderthals and Denisovans. Since nuclear DNA encompasses more information about a person's inheritance, a nuclear genome sequence from Homo heidelbergensis may reveal even more clearly how it is connected to other ancient humanlike species, he said. But retrieving the nuclear DNA sequence will be challenging, study authors wrote. Just to get the mitochondrial DNA sequence, it took about two grams of bone -- less than 0.1 ounce -- even though hundreds of copies of this DNA are in every cell. Still, Paabo said, the sequencing technique his group used "opens a possibility to now do this at many other sites, and really begin to understand earlier human evolution." Relationship to other species Researchers thought initially the mitochondrial DNA of the Homo heidelbergensis specimen would share a common ancestor with Neanderthals. Neanderthals lived in Europe beginning as much as 300,000 years ago, Paabo said. (Homo sapiens, our species, first appeared in Africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.) Instead, researchers discovered through the DNA that this specimen is closer to the Denisovans, a group related to the Neanderthals. A likely explanation is that in Eastern Eurasia this species gave rise to Denisovans, and in Western Eurasia they were the ancestors of Neanderthals, Paabo said. But more research needs to be done to verify that theory. Humans, Neanderthals related to yet another group Little is known about the Denisovans. Although some of their remains were found in southern Siberia, their genetic signature is only found today on islands in the Pacific. Paabo was also the senior author on a 2012 study in the journal Science analyzing the Denisovan genome. That research suggested that human ancestors and the Denisovans' ancestors must have branched off from one another as much as 700,000 years ago -- although that number is vague. Still, it seems that the Denisovans must have mated with indigenous people in Papua New Guinea and Australia, Paabo said. About 3% to 5% of the DNA of people from Melanesia (islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean), Australia and New Guinea as well as aboriginal people from the Philippines comes from the Denisovans. On the other hand, everyone who lives outside Africa today probably has some Neanderthal DNA in them, Paabo said in 2012. The bottom line, Paabo said, is that the relationships between these early human relatives -- Homo heidelbergensis, Neanderthals and Denisovans -- are not clear-cut. "It's going to be a more complex history that one will eventually clarify with the help of DNA," he said. Elizabeth Landau is on Twitter at @lizlandau.
An Illinois sheriff filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the owners of craigslist, accusing the popular national classified-ad Web site of knowingly promoting prostitution. "Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation," says Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart. Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart wants craigslist to eliminate its Erotic Services section. "Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation," Dart said. "Missing children, runaways, abused women and women trafficked in from foreign countries are routinely forced to have sex with strangers because they're being pimped on craigslist." The FBI found more than 2,800 child prostitution ads posted on craigslist, with Chicago, Illinois, in the top 10 cities for juvenile prostitution, Dart said. The sheriff also noted instances of what he said was child neglect while parents were engaged in activity solicited on the Web site. In an e-mailed statement, craigslist told CNN it had not seen Dart's complaint but that "craigslist is an extremely unwise choice for those intent on committing crimes, since criminals inevitably leave an electronic trail to themselves that law enforcement officers will follow." "On a daily basis, we are being of direct assistance to police departments and federal authorities nationwide," spokeswoman Susan McTavish said. "Misuse of craigslist to facilitate criminal activity is unacceptable, and we continue to work diligently to prevent it," she said. "Misuse of the site is exceptionally rare compared to how much the site is used for legal purposes. Regardless, any misuse of the site is not tolerated on craigslist." But Dart said that the Web site for two years has ignored his written requests to shut down the Erotic Services section and failed to take action or adequately monitor the section despite hundreds of arrests. "Pimps are preying on the most vulnerable members of our society and taking advantage of our struggling economy," he said. "The worst part is craigslist's owners know their Web site is still being used for illegal purposes and they're doing nothing to stop it." Craigslist entered into an agreement with 43 states' attorneys general in November to enact measures that impose restrictions on its Erotic Services section. The agreement called for the Web site to implement a phone verification system for listings that required ad posters to provide a real telephone number that would be called before the ad went public. Craigslist also imposed listing fees, requiring a credit card, for ads in the section. The proceeds were to be donated to charity. Dart called the fees "dirty money" and said the move was a "publicity stunt" that had little practical effect because pimps use stolen credit cards or post ads in free sections.
as well as the primary foil to the pro-business Koch brothers and their well-funded conservative donor network. The outfit, launched last year by the San Francisco billionaire, has already pledged to spend heavily this midterm year in Iowa to assist the Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley, and in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is facing a difficult re-election fight against Democrat Charlie Crist. Steyer's 2014 map now includes Senate races in Michigan, New Hampshire and Colorado as well as governor's races in Maine and Pennsylvania, home to two of the most endangered Republican governors in the country, Paul LePage and Tom Corbett. "This is the year, in our view, that we are able to demonstrate that you can use climate, you can do it well, you can do it in a smart way, to win political races," said Chris Lehane, the longtime Democratic consultant advising Steyer. Lehane and NextGen political strategist Sky Gallegos revealed their 2014 strategy Wednesday in a briefing with reporters in Washington. 'Pro-climate action' vs. 'anti-science' Absent from their list of 2014 targets: must-win Senate races for Democrats in conservative-leaning states such as Arkansas, Alaska, North Carolina, Louisiana and Kentucky. That's because Democrats on those ballots have expressed support for the Keystone XL pipeline, the coal industry, offshore drilling or hydraulic fracturing -- all nonstarter issues for environmentalists. Instead, Lehane said the 501(c)4 group will play in races that feature a stark choice between "pro-climate action" candidates -- all Democrats -- and "anti-science" Republicans who have questioned the veracity of climate change or supported the interests of the oil and gas industry. GOP candidates in the NextGen cross hairs -- Scott in Florida, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan, Scott Brown in New Hampshire and Cory Gardner in Colorado -- hew closely to the "Republican troglodyte brand," Lehane argued. "They are anti-immigrant, anti-women, anti-science," he said. "It's a tough brand to win elections around." The group said that climate can be successfully used as a wedge issue -- Lehane framed it as a moral clash between "right and wrong" -- to boost turnout among Democratic voting groups that tend not to show up in midterm election years, specifically young voters, Hispanics and African-Americans. As in the Virginia governor's race last year -- when Steyer spent nearly $8 million on a campaign to disqualify GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli with a combination of TV, mail and field operations -- the efforts will extend beyond the TV airwaves and include what they call "nano-targeting" to tailor messaging to discrete voting groups. "We are not some super PAC that's going to come in, throw up some ads and leave," Lehane said. "You can come into these states and really run a total campaign." Focusing on hyper-local issues Lehane said the effort, which is budgeted at around $100 million but could grow, will focus attention on hyper-local issues -- such as drought in Iowa or flood insurance costs in Florida -- that could influence voter perceptions in key pockets of each state. Pollution-related health concerns such as asthma and clean drinking water hit home for lower-income voters, he said. It wasn't lost on reporters that the NextGen map featured multiple states that figure prominently in presidential races -- Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida among them. Lehane said that was by design. "Almost all of these states align with being really important presidential states either in the primary process or the general election," he said, promising that Steyer will be active throughout the 2016 campaign. When the 2016 presidential primary campaigns lurch into overdrive next year, NextGen will continue to call attention to turnout-driving local issues -- and on attacking Republican candidates. Steyer has already funded an ad in Florida attacking Sen. Marco Rubio, one of many possible GOP White House aspirants, as a tool of oil lobbyists. "We look forward to a conversation with the Rubios of the world," Lehane said of the group's 2016 plans, without revealing specifics. The outside air cover should come as welcome news to Democratic candidates in their target states who are drowning in a flood of TV ads from conservative groups such as the Koch-endorsed Americans for Prosperity. But the campaign may put some Democrats in a bind. In Colorado, for instance, Lehane said NextGen will attack Gardner by showcasing his support for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and the adverse health effects of natural gas extraction on suburban communities. But the strategy could force Democratic Sen. Mark Udall to take a definitive stand on a divisive state issue that pits the business community against environmentalists, an important slice of the Democratic base. Meanwhile, the state's Democrat governor, John Hickenlooper, has been cautiously supportive of the gas industry as a revenue and jobs creator. Charges of hypocrisy As the founder of the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Steyer made part of his fortune from investments in fossil fuels, including foreign coal investments, which has prompted charges of hypocrisy from the Koch-affiliated groups he's fond of condemning. "Tom Steyer's investments at Farallon have lined his pockets with millions of dollars from the foreign coal industry," said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, the Koch-backed political network. "Now he wants to burden the American people with new energy regulations to protect his current green energy investments. He's already attempting to buy the votes of Senate Democrats on Keystone, which will cost America thousands of good-paying jobs. Surely the media will call him out on the hypocrisy of his claims." Lehane said Steyer ordered his investments be diverted from coal and tar sands when he stepped down from Farallon in 2012 but was not aware if he had investments in other energy sectors. But the primary difference between Steyer and conservative mega-donors, Lehane said, is that Steyer is not personally profiting from his political efforts. "He is giving all the money away," he said. "He doesn't have stand to gain some economic benefit by spending money that translates into his own personal economics." Lehane added, "We are spending a drop in the big oil bucket as compared to the fossil fuel industry, especially the Koch brothers. All Tom is trying to do is try to balance and level the playing field. We are never going to have as much money as the other side."
Television and YouTube singing sensation Susan Boyle has promised to be on her best behavior if she wins the right to sing for the queen. Susan Boyle sings "I Dreamed a Dream" -- and becomes a worldwide sensation. The 47-year-old Boyle, who says she has never been kissed, was catapulted into the spotlight after her rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream" from the musical "Les Miserables," on the television show "Britain's Got Talent" at the weekend. The winner of the show gets to sing for the queen at the Royal Variety Show. Boyle has a long way to go though -- having just won through to the second round after judge Simon Cowell described her first performance as "extraordinary." Still, she was already thinking of how she would behave. "Whatever comes my way, I am ready. It would be lovely to sing for the queen. There would be less of the carry on from me, and more of the singing.  Watch Boyle tell CNN 'it must have been a miracle' » "She is a very regal lady, very nice, so I would be nice too, and just get up there and give it a bit of wellie (try)," Boyle told the show's Web site. Boyle said she was trying to take her new found fame in her stride. "It's a challenge. Life is a challenge sometimes but this is different. And I like to test myself. "If it all gets too much and they lock me up, I want a great big strait-jacket with spots on it. A pink one... and a big zip on the back so I can escape." A clip of Boyle's performance had more than 11 million views on YouTube by Thursday, and the world's media have beaten a path to her door in Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland. Watch Boyle's singing wow the world » Cowell is reportedly already trying to piece together a record deal for Boyle, an unemployed charity worker, who lives with her cat, Pebbles. For fans of Boyle, who attracted laughs and sniggers when she first appeared on stage before winning a standing ovation, the album cannot come quick enough. CNN has been inundated with hundreds of messages of support for Boyle. Simone said: "I've been so depressed all day but hearing this woman sing and reading her story gave me a pick-me-up... I look forward to hearing more of her and I hope to buy her CD as soon as it hits the shelves." Cynthia wanted Cowell to move quickly. "She brought tears to my eyes and a lump in my throat. I hope Simon does get her a record contract...I'll buy her CD. Never judge a book by it's cover. Susan Boyle, you go, girl!" Jim described Boyle's talent as "unbelievable" and "beautiful." "I wish Susan the very best in her new life and hopefully someone has put her under contract. Thank you for such a beautiful song." Larry wanted to offer Boyle a kiss. "I have just heard you sing for the first time -- thanks to CNN -- and I must tell you this: You are a fabulous talent, simply amazing to me that no one took advantage of your voice and passion up until now. I am a happily married man, but if I were not, and if I was in the audience, I can guarantee you that I would ask for a kiss, and if you were gracious enough to indulge me, well that would have been one of the great highlights of my life. Looking forward to the first of many albums."
Roger Federer kept his hopes alive at the ATP World Tour Finals Thursday with a straight sets win over Richard Gasquet then repeated his demand for more rigorous doping controls in tennis. "I just feel like we're not getting maybe tested enough," said Federer after completing a 6-4 6-3 win over his French opponent. "I feel like I used to get tested more, I think I was tested 25 times in 2003, 2004. Ever since, I think it's been clearly going down this season. "Also last year when I won Dubai, Rotterdam and Indian Wells, and the year before that, I didn't get tested in one of those three events that I won. For me, that's not okay. "You show up and test a guy that's winning everything. That's sometimes what I struggle with. "But overall I trust the system. I think they're all very professional," the 17-time grand slam champion told gathered reporters. Drug testing has been a hot topic all week at the end of season showpiece in London, with World No.2 Novak Djokovic mounting an outspoken defense of his Serbian colleague Viktor Troicki and saying he had lost faith in the anti-doping regime. By contrast, Federer said he had little sympathy for Troicki, who saw his original ban cut from 18 months to 12 months Tuesday. Troicki failed to provide a blood sample after feeling unwell at the Monte Carlo Masters but claimed he had been given permission by the doping control doctor to come back the next day. "I do believe that when you are requested for a sample, you have to give the sample. It doesn't matter how bad you feel. I'm sorry," Federer said. "Like the test the next day for me is not a test any more because of what could have happened overnight. "I believe whatever they decided on. I think it's just very important to give the sample when you're requested to give it because there you are in front of them and there is no way to escape. That's where we just need to be extremely firm." Djokovic later beat Juan Martin Del Potro 6-3 3-6 6-3 in another tight three set match at the O2 Arena to book his passage into the semifinals. It was his 19th straight win since losing to Rafael Nadal in the final of the U.S. Open and kept him on course in his title defense in London. Defeat for Del Potro also boosted Federer's hopes of reaching the last four in a tournament he has won six times. He will now meet the Argentine in a winner takes all final Group B match Saturday.
Microsoft on Wednesday announced plans to redefine television as a medium that viewers can control by waving their hands and talking rather than clicking on remotes. In a speech to open the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, company CEO Steve Ballmer also said he aims to make TV more social -- letting viewers chat with each other as avatars in virtual settings and place live bets on sporting events from the TV screen. Perhaps it's time to say goodbye to the old-fashioned couch potato. At the center of this new vision for the living room is the Xbox 360, Microsoft's internet-connected gaming system that, thanks to an add-on called Kinect, can read and interpret players' motions. "Your Xbox is becoming the hub of your living room," he said. "It is your gaming system. It is your movies. It is your TV experience." Ballmer announced an update to that system that lets Kinect's cameras read facial expressions and mouth movements in addition to what their arms and legs are doing. Called "Avatar Kinect," this new feature, which is due out in the spring, will allow friends to meet up as avatars -- or video-game likenesses of themselves -- in virtual settings. A demo of this feature showed avatars chatting at a virtual-world tailgate while sitting in digital, plaid lawn chairs. In another demo, female avatars got together on a neon set, as if they were collaborating on an online talk show. Kinect's cameras watch the friends from the top of their TVs and translates their facial expressions into the digital hangout. "As you can see now Kinect can track features like your smile, your laugh and even the raise of your eyebrows," Ballmer said, offering a demo of himself as a bald avatar -- his digital eyebrows bouncing up and down. Ballmer described these virtual meet-ups as a "new way to socialize." But, even during his speech, some Twitter users wrote they found that idea downright creepy. "This seems unhealthy," one Twitter user wrote. "Will it also track Eye Winks? or false eyelashes? What about coloured contact lens?" wrote another. Others wrote that they're fine with non-Microsoft devices controlling their living room electronics experience. "Sorry Ballmer, my PS3 is the hub of my living room," one @cnntech Twitter follower wrote, referencing the Sony gaming system. The Avatar Kinect feature is available only to people who pay a subscription fee for an Xbox Live membership, which costs about $60 per year. Even without the avatars, TV is getting more social as it brings elements of the internet into the living room, Ballmer said. Microsoft announced a partnership with ESPN, for instance, that lets people watch the BCS college football championship game over Xbox Live. Viewers can chat with friends on the TV screen during the game and place non-monetary bets about who they think will win. They can see how their predictions stack up against that of their friends and the Xbox Live community at large. Football fans would be ranked according to success, allowing sports fans to "earn their bragging rights," said Ron Forbes, from Microsoft's interactive entertainment division. "Now I can make my picks and trash talk as I'm watching the game," he said. "Not on e-mail, not over text -- right in my living room on the TV." This trend of internet-enabled, or "connected" TV is set to be a major theme of this year's CES, where TV makers from Panasonic to Sony are announcing app stores and other features that are designed to bring social media and Web experiences to TV. Some of these companies work internet features directly into the television instead of requiring a separate gadget, as is the case with Microsoft's Xbox. Others, like the Yap.tv app for the Apple iPad, aim to let another device provide a social experience that can supplement live TV viewing. The idea of internet TV has been tried many times before but has never gone fully mainstream. But Microsoft's internet-TV system does do one thing other don't -- full-body motion control. The company highlighted this point repeatedly, announcing partnerships, for instance, with Netflix and HuluPlus that let Xbox Kinect users control those video apps by waiving their hands and talking to the system to select and play movies. It's a "new world of controller-free entertainment that you cannot find anywhere else," Forbes said. The company said it had sold 8 million Kinect sensors in 60 days, beating its goal of selling 5 million during that timeframe. The keynote address also highlighted other Microsoft efforts, including Windows Phone 7 and the Windows PC operating system, which is in the process of being upgraded to work on a range of devices, including buzz-worthy tablet computers. Microsoft is widely criticized as being behind the curve on developing an operating system for tablets. The company promised an update to its mobile Windows Phone 7 operating system that will add copy-paste functionality and the ability to switch between apps more quickly. Those features are already available from the two hottest smartphone ecosystems: the Apple iOS and Google Android. Some bloggers and wrote that Microsoft hid its skeletons in the closet during the speech -- straying from tablets and smartphones, which are big topics with other companies. But Ballmer said Microsoft is looking to the future -- and that will include all tech platforms, not just personal computers. The company aims to "redefine what is really possible" with technology, he said.
Protection from the Sahara's howling dust storms may have helped the Sphinx maintain its steady gaze over the millennia. Newly discovered walls on the Giza plateau were part of an enclosure to protect the Sphinx from wind-borne sand, Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities says. According to some texts, the walls were built by King Thutmose IV (1400-1390 BCE) because of a dream he had during a hunting trip, the council's secretary general, Zahi Hawass, said Tuesday. "In the king's dream the Sphinx asked the king to move the sand away from his body because it choked him," Hawass said in a written statement. For the favor, the Sphinx promised to make Thutmose IV king of Egypt. Until the discovery of sections of the walls buried in the sand on the eastern and southern side of the giant figure, archaeologists believed there was a wall only on its north side. The new sections are part of a larger wall, Hawass said. One wall runs north-south and is 282 feet (86 meters) long, while the other runs east-west and is 151 feet (46 meters) long. Both walls stand about 3 feet (1 meter) tall. Researchers also may have found the remains of a wall dating to the time of King Khafre, whose pyramid is the second largest in Giza. Khafre's burial complex boasted an unprecedented profusion of statues, among them the Sphinx, according to National Geographic. Carved from bedrock in front of Khafre's pyramid, the Sphinx depicts the pharaoh as a human-headed lion, wearing the headdress of the pharaohs.
Authorities in North Carolina ordered the evacuation of Ocracoke Island late on Tuesday as Hurricane Earl whips closer to the United States. The mandatory order, which was issued for all visitors and residents of Ocracoke, goes into effect at 5 a.m. on Wednesday, said Lindsey Mooney, interim emergency management coordinator with Hyde County Emergency Management. He added thousands of people would likely be affected by the decision. Hurricane Earl is approaching the United States just ahead of Labor Day, a holiday weekend that many families spend at the beach. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for most of the North Carolina coast, from Surf City, North Carolina, to the state's northern border with Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. It called Hurricane Earl "large and intense." Earl, which quickly morphed into a Category 4 hurricane on Monday, dealt a glancing blow to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, downing trees and knocking out power lines. Tuesday, the hurricane was passing the Turks and Caicos. Earl will approach within 60 miles of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, early Friday morning, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Hurricane-force winds will be possible along the Outer Banks of North Carolina beginning early on Friday morning and lasting until at least midday, he said. Morris forecast Earl will pass within 60 miles of Nantucket, Massachusetts, as a strong Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane overnight Friday. However, sustained hurricane-force winds should not affect coastal Massachusetts as the majority of winds will be tropical-storm force beginning Friday afternoon and lasting until midday on Saturday, he said. As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Earl was about 125 miles (235 kilometers) east-northeast of Grand Turk Island and about 835 miles (1,545 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was heading northwest at about 14 mph (22 kph). The hurricane's core was "passing well east of the Turks and Caicos Islands," the hurricane center said. "Tropical storm conditions are probably affecting the vicinity of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Weather conditions will likely improve in these islands on Wednesday." Earl's maximum sustained winds are at 135 mph (215 kph). It is a large storm, with hurricane-force winds stretching 90 miles (150 km) from its center and tropical storm-force winds extending outward some 200 miles (325 kilometers). "Some fluctuations in intensity are likely, but Earl is forecast to retain Category 4 status for the next day or two," the hurricane center said. The U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, has ordered ships in its area to prepare to head to sea within 24 hours if conditions worsen, according to Beth Baker, a spokeswoman for the Navy. A separate order will be given if it's decided that various Naval aircraft in the region need to be moved, she said. The Navy also issued on Tuesday a "Hurricane Condition 4," which tells people living and working around the Norfolk area to be prepared for "destructive winds" within 72 hours and to take the proper precautions. A FEMA team is already in North Carolina to provide support if necessary, Craig Fugate, Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, told reporters on a conference call. Additional teams have been designated for each state on the coast if needed. He urged those living in the region to prepare for the storm, stock up on supplies and have a plan if it becomes necessary. Besides FEMA's Ready.gov website, people can use FEMA's mobile application, which links to the National Hurricane Center, to stay up to date on information. Tips include developing a family communications plan, putting together a kit with 72 hours of food and water and staying informed of risks in the area. FEMA officials urged residents to heed any evacuation orders that their state and local governments might make. The federal group stressed it does not make evacuation decisions. Even without making landfall, hurricanes can trigger dangerous rip currents -- a narrow channel of water that flows seaward from beaches. The currents can be strong enough to carry even experienced swimmers into deeper water. On Tuesday, a National Weather Service coastal advisory was in effect for the eastern coast of Florida, mostly due to Earl's presence in the Caribbean. The advisory warned that dangerous rip currents and rough surf are possible. "Dozens of rescues along with one surf-related fatality were reported over the past few days in very hazardous ocean conditions," the advisory said. Over the weekend, hundreds of rescues took place in Maryland and elsewhere because of rip currents spawned by then-Hurricane Danielle, which stayed well offshore. Danielle has since lost its tropical characteristics and moved out into the open Atlantic. A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, and a tropical storm watch was in effect for the southeastern Bahamas. Those areas could experience above-normal tides, along with "large and dangerous battering waves" on Tuesday, forecasters said. A tropical storm watch is also in effect for the North Carolina coast between Cape Fear, North Carolina and Surf City, North Carolina, the hurricane center said. Earl could dump between 1 and 3 inches of rain on the Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas, with up to 6 inches possible in some areas, the hurricane center said. But forecasters said conditions on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, including gusty winds, were expected to improve as Earl departed, and storm surge flooding and waves will diminish. "We were quite fortunate because there was no direct hit in this case," Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno told CNN's "American Morning." But, he said, the island experienced "lots of rain" and some high winds. As of Tuesday morning, 174,000 customers were without power, he said, and 33,000 lacked water service. "There are some roads that are blocked because trees have fallen," Fortuno said. "Those are being removed as we speak, and hopefully we'll be able to get back to normal during the course of the day and tomorrow will be a regular working day." Tito Hernandez, FEMA federal coordinating official, told reporters Tuesday that close to 200,000 were without power on Puerto Rico, and officials were focusing on restoration. About 160 people spent Monday night in 18 shelters on the island, he said, and 57 people took refuge in four shelters in the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, both locations "fared very well," Hernandez said. Schools were expected to reopen Wednesday, he said. Transportation from Puerto Rico to the outlying islands of Culebra and Vieques had resumed, and ports in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were reopening Tuesday. A CNN iReport showed sheets of torrential rain on Puerto Rico, along with gusty winds. Other iReports showed downed trees and flooding on Montserrat and St. John in the Virgin Islands. Residents were being asked to stay home so that downed trees and power lines could be removed, Fortuno said. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands could see an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain as Earl pulls away, the Hurricane Center said on Tuesday. Another storm could be poised to deliver a one-two punch to Puerto Rico and other areas of the Caribbean. Tropical Storm Fiona developed on Monday and appeared to be following in Earl's footsteps. It remained a weak tropical storm as of Tuesday, the Hurricane Center said. However, it was enough to prompt a tropical storm warning for St. Martin and St. Barthelemy and a tropical storm watch for Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius. A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph, are forecast within 36 hours. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours. Read said Fiona is not projected to affect Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but could affect Bermuda by the weekend. "Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor the progress of Fiona," forecasters said. "Additional watches or warnings may be required for a portion of the area." As of 8 p.m., the center of Fiona was located about 300 miles (485 kilometers) east-southeast of the Leeward Islands. It had winds of about 40 mph (65 kph) and was moving west-northwest at about 24 mph (39 kph). Some slow strengthening is possible over the next day or two, forecasters said. "We are following what the National Weather Service is telling us" on Fiona, Fortuno told CNN. "They're telling us that it is not as organized as Earl. However, it could bring about some rain, and that's what concerns me. So we'll just keep a very close eye on it and see what happens." CNN's Angela Fritz and Sean C. Morris contributed to this report.
including a fully rotatable thumb. "This is something we've never seen available for patients before," said John Miguelez, senior clinical director at Advanced Arm Dynamics, who is not affiliated with Touch Bionics. The prosthesis also has an auto-grasp feature, which prevents accidental slippage when, say, holding a soda can or picking up an apple. But the most unique part of the prosthetic is the app control. On an iPod Touch or an iPhone 5, users can select 24 different types of grip patterns that will allow more functionality. "If you are holding a computer mouse (and) you want to right click, that is a complicated thing with a prosthetic. But this integrated app technology allows a person to do this with ease," said Miguelez. These are basic movements many of us take for granted: a tri-pod grip to pick up a pen, or hand-shake grip for business meetings, said Miguelez, who has fitted hundreds of amputees with prosthetic devices. Amputee scales 103 floors with mind-controlled 'bionic leg' "For the first time in five years I can hold my daughter's hand," said Koger. "I can't tell you what a gift that feels like." Users can also customize grip patterns through the integrated app technology. "Let's say you want to go out and play pool with your friends. You can customize a grasp pattern that allows you to hold the pool stick -- or if you like to do handy work, you may customize one to hold an electric drill," said Miguelez. The hands are not waterproof, which is one reason Koger says he'll still keep his other prosthetics, like his metal claw, available. "Nothing is perfect, but I feel like I can be a more active participant in everyday life with these hands," said Koger, who now spends his time reaching out to new amputees about keeping a positive outlook on their situation. "I can do pretty much everything I could before; it just might take me a little longer."
Raw satellite data about missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be released Tuesday, a Malaysian official said Monday. Malaysian acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein made the comments about the data from satellite company Inmarsat as he toured a newly constructed terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Families of the passengers on board the plane, which disappeared in March over Southeast Asia while carrying 239 people, have been demanding that the raw data be made public. The fate of the plane and those on board has become one of the great aviation mysteries of modern times. Inmarsat, the company whose satellites communicated with the missing plane in its last hours, had said it didn't have the authority to release the data. But last week, Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities said they were trying to make the raw data accessible. "In line with our commitment towards greater transparency, all parties are working for the release of the data communication logs and the technical description of the analysis for public consumption," Inmarsat and the Malaysian aviation officials said in a joint statement. Publication of the raw satellite data could allow for independent analysis of what happened on March 8, the day the Boeing 777 veered sharply off its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and dropped off radar screens. Analysts have said the data could help discount some theories about what happened to the jetliner, and potentially fuel new ones. Malaysia and Australia, the two countries at the forefront of the search, have said that an analysis by international experts of all the available information -- including the satellite data -- leads them to conclude that the plane ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. But months of searching above and below the surface of the ocean has so far failed to find any physical trace of the missing passenger jet. CNN's Saima Mohsin and Mitra Mobasherat reported from Kuala Lumpur, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.
say it out loud to get the joke -- has menu items like "Charlotte's Rack, sure to be voted biggest rack" named after Grimes' mom and "Abby's Hugh Jass," a burger named after her sister. They also sell souvenirs like an apron with "Check Out My Buns" emblazoned across it. The restaurant's approach has raised eyebrows, especially since Grimes' camp accused the GOP of sexism. "I am the Kentucky woman who my Republican colleagues in this state so gentlemanly refer to as an empty dress," Grimes said. When we tried to ask Grimes about her family's use of double entendre, she refused to answer, letting her security detail lead her away from reporters.
A policeman fatally shot a Christian man and wounded five other Christians Tuesday in an attack on a train in Egypt, officials said. The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. when a man walked onto the train, which was stopped in the station at Samalut, about 200 kilometers south of Cairo, said Maryanne Nabil Thaki, 29, one of the victims. She said she was seated with her sister, Maggie Nabil Thaki, 25, their 52-year-old mother, Sabah Sinot Suleiman, and Maggie's fiance, 26-year-old Ehab Ashraf Kamal. They were en route to Cairo to buy an engagement ring, Maggie Thaki said. Seated near them was an older Christian couple, Maryanne Nabil Thaki said. The gunman walked up and down the length of the train, then walked back to two groups of people who were seated near each other and were both Coptic Christians, she told a reporter at the Good Shepherd Hospital in Samalut, where she was being treated for gunshot wounds to the leg and the chest. The man said in Arabic, "There is no God but God," and opened fire, she said. The shooter fled the train, but was captured later, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. The suspect, a deputy policeman, was identified as Amer Ashoor Abdel-Zaher Hassan. He boarded the train in Asiut and was en route to Bani Mazar, Menya province, where he works. The older man, Fathi Saeed Ebaid, 71, of Cairo, was killed, a local security source told the state-run Egyptian news agency MENA. His wife, Emily Hannah Tedly, 61, was in critical condition, as was the mother of the two younger women, said Dr. Petra Kamal. All five were to be flown to Cairo for further treatment, a hospital employee said. In front of the hospital, about a dozen Copts demonstrated in support of the victims but were dispersed by police who fired a tear gas canister that broke through a fifth-floor hospital window, said hospital employee Mina Farouk. The attack comes 10 days after a bombing killed 23 Coptic Christians outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria, Egypt, an attack that unnerved Christians and led to increased security. Relations between the Christian minority and Muslim majority within Egypt have been tense since that New Year's Day bombing. Those troubles were evident last Friday -- the day Coptic Christians, who follow the Julian calendar, celebrate Christmas -- when police staged a large-scale security operation outside the same church. In a show of solidarity, some Egyptian Muslims attended the Christmas services. Still, protests have erupted almost nightly in many Christian areas of Egypt since the bombing. Egyptian authorities have released a sketch of a man they think was the suicide bomber in the church attack. The Interior Ministry used forensic technology to re-create the face. About 9 percent of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Housam Ahmed and Amir Ahmed and Journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report.
Cornelia Wallace, ex-wife of four-time Alabama Gov. George Wallace, has died, the governor's office announced. She was in her late 60s. The cause of death was not immediately known. "She served as first lady during a very turbulent time and our thoughts and prayers are with her family today," Alabama Gov. Bob Riley and wife Patsy said in a statement. Cornelia Wallace first met her husband at a party in the Alabama governor's mansion when her uncle, James Folsom, was governor and she was only eight years old, Time Magazine reported in 1972. She was 19 years younger than Wallace. At the time, Wallace was a state legislator married to his first wife, Lurleen, who also served as Alabama governor. The then Cornelia Ellis went to the semifinals of the Miss Alabama contest before becoming the star of the Cypress Gardens water ski show in Florida, Time reported. She married John Snively III, a millionaire whose family once owned the Gardens. The couple had two sons but divorced seven years later. After Lurleen Wallace died of cancer in 1968, George Wallace got back in touch with Cornelia Ellis Snively and they married in 1971. The following year, Cornelia Wallace was beside her husband when he was shot in a 1972 assassination attempt in a Maryland parking lot. George and Cornelia Wallace divorced after his failed bid for the U.S. presidency in 1976. George Wallace died in Montgomery on September 13, 1998.
Speculation has been rife about the future of the Spyker Formula 1 team for some time. First there were the financial struggles at Spyker Cars, the luxury automobile manufacturer that gave the team its name. Spyker Cars took out a $4 million loan to keep afloat, using the "Spyker" name as collateral. Even if Spyker Cars sells its entire stake in the team, FIA rules state that the team must retain the Spyker F1 name Then there was the surprise sacking of the Dutch driver, Christijan Albers after he had failed to bring in promised sponsorship revenue. What was most surprising about this was that Albers was widely assumed to be the person who brought the Spyker name -- and money -- to the team. His father in law, Roel Koojiman, is a wealthy Dutch financier and Albers was close to Michiel Mol, the team's owner. Last week Spyker Cars announced that it was to sell some or all of its stake in Spyker Formula 1. Immediately Spyker Formula 1 responded with a press release intended to quash speculation that the team would not be able to finish the 2007 season. Speaking exclusively to CNN, team principal Collin Kolles hinted that a rescue deal is in place: "Actually it's too early to talk about it. The only thing I can say is that we will be racing in Formula 1 in the future." One potential problem is that FIA rules mean that a team cannot change its name mid-season. In September 2006, when Spyker bought the Midland F1 Racing team, it used the Spyker name as a headline sponsor: "Spyker MF1 Racing". This year it was allowed to change the team's name to "Spyker Formula 1" but it may have to retain the Spyker name. "That's for sure," continues Kolles, "you even cannot change name more than once in five years without agreement from the other teams. It's speculation, the name might change, but it might not -- even with different ownership." Midland F1 had only raced for eleven grands prix before Spyker's takeover. In 2005 it had raced under the "Jordan" name after having bought the Jordan team the previous year. So the team has already had three names in as many years. Further complicating Spyker's difficult year is its legal challenge against Scuderia Toro Rosso and Super Aguri. Spyker maintains that these teams are merely B-teams racing cars that are barely-disguised versions of the outgoing cars of their parent teams (Red Bull Racing and Honda, respectively). Spyker's contention is that, as an independent constructor, it has to pay for its own chassis development, its own wind-tunnel testing and so on. This situation is to deepen next year, when FIA regulations will allow new customer teams to join the grid. One of these is expected to be Prodrive, who many speculate will be driving McLaren MP4-22s (this year's McLaren F1 car) in the 2008 season. Kolles believes these new teams -- along with Toro Rosso and Super Aguri -- should be treated differently to the genuine constructors' teams. "We have a clear line on this," says Kolles, "first of all arbitration will continue. We made a verbal agreement after the British Grand Prix. We don't have it in written form yet. Until we have agreement we believe customer cars cannot be equally regarded as constructors' cars. And that's our position, and not only our position but the position of basically all the other teams." Looking to the future, Kolles is bullish and points to the team's past success as Jordan: "The team is still the fifth most successful team in the current Formula 1 era. It's more successful than Toyota or Honda. We have shown -- as in Monte Carlo in the free practice -- if it's raining we are competitive and the team works very well in moments where you have to make quick decisions." E-mail to a friend
Most of us have dreamed of telling our bosses what they can do with this stupid job, perhaps with the help of a marching band, if your fantasies skew grandiose. So what happens to the guy who actually does it and lives to post a video of the stunt on YouTube? The numbers don't lie: Twenty-four-year-old Joey DeFrancesco has become a veritable Internet celebrity, a hero and a viral video sensation. The original YouTube video of "Joey Quits" earned more than 2 million views a week, which includes 18,092 likes and 438 dislikes and counting. "I'm goingï»¿ to quit like that if I'm going to quit," one commenter said, echoing the wishful thinking of many. "Joey is the hero of all downtrodden workers because he is the embodiment of 'take this job and shove it.' He's living out the fantasies of countless workers who also hate their bosses," said Allison Hemming, CEO of the Hired Guns, a digital marketing and talent agency. Beyond resonating with millions of people, the video says a few things about how social media are changing the way businesses interact not just with customers but with employees, she said. "Managers should remember that if you're terrible to your people while they are working for you, your formerly silent former employees will have a platform to out you in a potentially very public way. And that sentiment can effect your business too." It also demonstrates how social media are allowing employees to control the circumstances of their departure for a change, said Anne Kreamer, a former Nickelodeon executive and author of "It's Always Personal: Emotions in the New Workplace." She cited ousted Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz's e-mail to Yahoo employees saying "I've just been fired over the phone" as another example of someone getting in front of their former bosses to control the message. "Rather than having the situation defined for them, people are trying to shape the conversation on their own. For all we know, Joey was going to get fired the next day, but he turned it around." The video's release couldn't be more timely, although DeFrancesco made the video when he quit his job at the Renaissance Providence Downtown Hotel in August. The unemployment rate has remained at 9.1%, since July and new claims for unemployment benefits have lingered above 400,000 since April. Those factors, taken with the Occupy Wall Street movement, create the ideal cultural climate for the birth of an Internet folk hero who embodies the anger and malaise felt by many, Kreamer said. "There's a kind of confluence of events that's forcing people's anger and dissatisfaction to the surface. Everyone's been taking it on the chin for years because of the recession but now they're exhausted and want change," Kreamer said. "Joey's approach is unique in saying, 'I'm going to have some fun with this.' " DeFrancesco is not the first, and he's probably not the last, to publicly stage his flame-out. If anything, his video is the latest example of how the Internet age has created a broader platform for behavior that used to be contained to smaller circles, Oregon-based career coach Dorothy Tannahill Moran said. "People have been flaming out publicly forever. Now, with social media, we have a bigger stage for our flame-outs, and there's ever so many more places for it to be done," Moran said. A YouTube video posted in 2007 shows a Moe's Southwest Grill manager tearing off his work shirt to reveal a white T-shirt with the words "I QUIT" while "Ice, Ice Baby" plays. The worker launches into a respectable imitation of Vanilla Ice's original dance routine, complete with backup dancers. Another take on the "I QUIT" chest proclamation appeared in a 2008 YouTube video of a man who tears off his shirt and has the phrase written on his bare skin. He giddily skips around the office, boom box on shoulder, with "just gotta get right outta here" from Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" on a loop. The last disgruntled employee to strike a chord in the public consciousness was former JetBlue flight attendant Steven Slater, who famously deployed an emergency evacuation slide to dramatically exit an airplane after announcing to the flight that he was fed up. Slater was back in the news Thursday when he was sentenced to a year of probation after completing a mental health treatment program. His departure will cost him $10,000 in restitution to JetBlue, the price of repairing or replacing the emergency evacuation chute. Slater told CNN the past year had been "long" and "challenging." He spent much of it commuting to a New York treatment facility from Los Angeles, where took care of his ill mother, who died this year. But just imagine if someone had captured the incident on camera, Moran said. Each departure reflects how the person felt about his job. "The question becomes what's the genesis of what prompted them to not just quit but to engage others in their departure," she said. "It's usually a combination of frustrations, usually oriented toward management, but it can also include other stressors from the job." DeFrancesco said problems with management led to his departure. He said he worked at the hotel for more than three years, during which time he participated in a push for employees to join a union. The employees prevailed, but the struggle damaged relations between management and employees, he said. "They treat us like s***," DeFrancesco said at the start of the YouTube video. "I'm going to go and quit right now with the help of my bandmates." On the video, he leads members of the What Cheer? Brigade into the hotel through a side entrance. His boss encounters them and tells them to leave, DeFrancesco responds by handing him a letter and saying "I quit." Cue the band as DeFrancesco walks away, smiling broadly, hands raised in triumph. DeFrancesco said he has a new job that allows him to use his history degree, but he wouldn't say where. But it's hard to say what the stunt will cost him in the long run, Hemming said. "If Joey wants to work in a creative industry, he may get to keep his hero status and use it to his advantage," she said. "I'd say to him, get an agent, use this moment to your advantage." Finding a job in corporate America, where potential employers do extensive background checks, could be more challenging, she said. "He can expect to definitely be Googled by hiring and recruiting managers who might take a pass on him because they'll think, 'do I want to be the butt of a Joey joke when he quits on me in a few years? This guy seems like a disgruntled employee before I've even met him. I think I'll pass.' " Or, maybe it won't matter in a few years, as we grow even more accustomed to living our lives online. "My guess is he's not going to want to work in the hotel industry, but he's super-young, so don't think it'll irreparably ruin his chances. Depending on the job, it might endear him to a potential employer."
Rachel Washburn once carried pompoms. Now she carries an M4 carbine. The military brat who became an NFL cheerleader is today a first lieutenant in the United States Army. On Sunday, she was honored as a Hometown Hero by the Philadelphia Eagles, the team she cheered for from 2007 to 2009. The Bronze Star recipient served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, including one as a member of the Army's new Cultural Support Program. It was a dangerous and stressful job, where she would go on missions with special operations forces and help search and talk to Afghan women and children. "We could be their voice during missions for engagement to ensure security on objectives, and we could help search and secure the females and the children during missions," she told the Philadelphia Eagles website. Spoken like a true soldier -- which is not surprising given her father, Lon, served many years in the Army and Air Force as a pilot. Rachel Washburn, 25, said she learned during her Army training to think of a happy place when confronted by stress. For that, she liked to think of her first game as an Eagles cheerleader. It was a beautiful August day and she was lined up for the pregame dance. It is one of her best memories, she said. She also recalled fondly her trips to hospitals in Philadelphia and a USO trip to Iraq. Cheerleading is more than just dancing on the sideline and looking pretty, she said. "We're all beautiful women who are there to be entertaining at games, but also, we are incredibly involved in the community, which is something that I am incredibly proud of," she told the Eagles. Washburn is not a Philly native. She said she is "from a little bit of everywhere" after having moved at least a dozen times while growing up. But she loved Philadelphia from her visits there and applied for an Army ROTC scholarship at Drexel University. She also joined the dance team. Her next steps took her to tryouts for the Eagles cheerleading squad. She made the team on her first try. After she graduated, Washburn joined the Army and went to Afghanistan, where near the end of her first tour she helped deliver a baby during a snowstorm while communicating with medical personnel by radio. She told USA Today that during her second tour she was a platoon leader of an intelligence unit. She is considering re-enlisting next year, she told the paper. Her father nominated her for the Eagles honor. "I watched her go through two tours in Afghanistan and all of the things that she sacrificed," he said. "It was not a very easy couple of tours and I just really kind of thought, 'Man, what a homecoming that would be if (the Eagles) recognized her for that.'" She returned from Afghanistan in November and is stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia.
North Korea is to blow up a key part of its controversial Yongbyon nuclear reactor on Friday. Hyun Hak-Bong (right), North Korea's deputy negotiator to six-party talks, crosses the border into South Korea on June 5. The destruction of the plant's cooling tower is part of an agreement with the United States aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula in exchange for loosening some restrictions on the highly secretive Communist country. The North Korean government has invited news organizations, including CNN, to witness the event. Earlier this year, Pyongyang agreed to disable its nuclear reactor and provide a full accounting of its plutonium stockpile, "acknowledge" concerns about its proliferation activities and its uranium enrichment activity, and agree to continue cooperation with a verification process to ensure no further activities are taking place. North Korea has been taking Yongbyon's main reactor apart, but imploding the cooling tower is an exceptionally important psychological step given that the highly recognizable shape of the structure is synonymous with nuclear power plants. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, says it would take a year to rebuild if North Korea decided to go back on its agreement, and that the construction could not be done in secret. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice defended U.S. diplomacy toward North Korea last week, saying the deal with Pyongyang made Asia and the U.S. safer. Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, Rice said that "North Korea will soon give its declaration of nuclear programs to China." China is the host of the six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program, along with Russia, South Korea, Japan and the United States. Rice spoke in advance of her upcoming trip to Asia where she will be attending a meeting of G8 foreign ministers and meeting with her Asian counterparts. Rice said once North Korea submits its declaration, President Bush will notify Congress he intends to remove North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and scrap some sanctions levied against North Korea because of nuclear concerns. But she noted that there would be no practical effect to loosening the restrictions because North Korea still was under the same sanctions because of other areas of U.S. law. Rice said a 45-day review would then begin to see if North Korea is telling the truth and living up to its end of the deal struck in the six-party talks. "Before those actions go into effect, we would continue to assess the level of North Korean cooperation in helping to verify the accuracy and completeness of its declaration," she said. "And if that cooperation is insufficient, we will respond accordingly." The United States softened its demand that North Korea publicly admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and to providing Syria with nuclear technology, key unanswered questions that have left negotiations stalled for months. North Korea has already handed over about 18,000 documents on its nuclear past to the U.S., which the U.S. says are critical to verify North Korea's claims. Rice said that the deal with North Korea wasn't perfect but offered the U.S. the best chance to learn about North Korea's nuclear history. "We must keep the broader goal in mind: the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons and programs, all of them," she said. "North Korea has said that it is committed to this goal. We'll see." Rice said that "no final agreement can be concluded" unless the U.S. verifies North Korea's claims. CNN State Department Correspondent Elise Labott contributed to this report
One of sport's most high-profile couples are no more. Golf star Rory McIlroy announced Wednesday that he had broken off his engagement to tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. The two-time major winner from Northern Ireland said the issuing of wedding invitations over the weekend had made him realize he wasn't prepared for "all that marriage entails." McIlroy and former world No. 1 Wozniacki, from Denmark, announced their engagement via social media on New Year's Day -- but their three-year relationship is now over. "There is no right way to end a relationship that has been so important to two people," McIlroy said in a statement reported by the UK Press Association. "The problem is mine. The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realize that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails. "I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. "I will not be saying anything more about our relationship in any setting." McIlroy, ranked 10th in the world, is currently preparing for the European Tour's flagship event -- the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in England. He spoke briefly about the split at a press conference ahead of Thursday's opening round, telling reporters: "Obviously (it's) quite a difficult time for Caroline and myself. "I think the statement really said it all this morning. It was mutual and amicable and we both thought it was the best for us, the best for both of us. Time to move on and I think I've said all that I need to say. "Now I need to get my head into golf and concentrate on the tournament, keep myself busy and try and have a good week on the course. "I'm not going to lie. It's going to be very difficult. But you know, at least when I get inside the ropes I can just try and concentrate on the shot at hand. But yeah, it's obviously going to be difficult." Only on Sunday McIlroy tweeted a picture while the pair were enjoying dinner together at Nobu restaurant in Monte Carlo. The couple, who were referred to as 'Wozzilroy' by the world's media, began dating in 2011 after meeting at a boxing match. They had to deal with constant rumors as to their health of their relationship, which were magnified when both suffered slumps in their career during 2013. But on January 1 they took to their respective Twitter accounts to confirm they were engaged to be married with Wozniacki saying: "Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ... I said YES!!!!" McIlroy captured his first major title at the U.S. Open in 2011 and followed it up by claiming the US PGA Championship the following year, but has struggled for form of late. Wozniacki, who is yet to win a grand slam title but did top the world rankings in 2010, is preparing for the second major of the tennis season -- the French Open -- which starts on May 25. She made her first response to the split on Twitter Thursday saying, "It's a hard time for me right now. Thanks for all the sweet messages! Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I'll never walk alone."
The biological father of a Native American child was arrested Monday after defying a court order to return the girl to her adoptive parents, the latest development in a four-year case that has spanned state lines and tested an unusual federal law. Matt and Melanie Capobianco, a white couple from South Carolina, legally adopted Veronica at birth in September 2009. When Veronica's father, Cherokee Nation member Dusten Brown, learned of her adoption a few months later, he asserted his custody rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act, setting off a lengthy legal fight. A family court judge ruled in Brown's favor in late 2011, and he took his daughter back. The Capobiancos have fought ever since to have Veronica returned. Timeline of 'Baby Veronica' adoption case The case has bounced from family court to the U.S. Supreme Court and back again. After South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled last month to allow the Capobiancos' adoption to be finalized, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene, thus giving the ultimate go-ahead for the Charleston couple to regain custody of Veronica. The girl's transition back to the Capobiancos was supposed to begin last week. Brown, however, never showed up with his daughter. A family court judge in South Carolina ordered the girl to be handed over immediately, saying she was being "unlawfully withheld from her lawful parents." The Charleston County Sheriff's Office issued a warrant for Brown on Friday for interfering with custody. Brown was arrested Monday in his home state of Oklahoma after turning himself in. He posted a $10,000 bond, according to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office and Amanda Clinton, spokeswoman for the Cherokee Nation District Court. Justices refuse again to intervene in adoption dispute It wasn't clear Monday evening, however, where Brown or his daughter were. Melanie Capobianco told reporters that Veronica is being "illegally held against the wishes of her parents and the courts," and she pleaded for her daughter's return. "With every passing hour, we fear more and more for her safety and well-being," she said. "If anything should happen to our daughter while she's being left in the hands of those who hold her captive from us, the responsibility will be shared by many." She added, "We pray that those who are holding Veronica will do the right thing and send Veronica home to us, please." Charleston County authorities said they are in touch with Oklahoma officials about extraditing Brown "as well as pursuing all available options in locating Baby Veronica." Brown told CNN's Randi Kaye over the weekend that he is willing to go to jail for his daughter. "I'm going to fight till I have no fight left in me and till they say you can't fight no more," Brown said. "This is my daughter. It's not a yo-yo that I can just say, hey, I borrowed it for two years and here's it back." Brown claims the Indian Child Welfare Act allows him to have parental custody of Veronica over the Capobiancos. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that Brown could not rely on the act for relief because he did not have legal or physical custody of Veronica at the time of the adoption proceedings, which the birth mother initiated without his knowledge. Brown, who was not married to Veronica's non-Indian mother when she was conceived, signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption and relinquishing his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support. His attorneys say Brown did not understand the extent of the waiver and that the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give Veronica up for adoption. CNN's Marlena Baldacci, Christine Theodoru, Mayra Cuevas, Joe Sutton, Randi Kaye and Bill Mears contributed to this report.
The "humanitarian situation remains serious" in Zimbabwe amid cholera, starvation and a continuing economic crisis, a United Nations official said Wednesday at a World Humanitarian Day ceremony in Harare. The cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe resulted in nearly 100,000 cases, 4,288 of them fatal, the U.N. said. "Although Zimbabwe is not facing armed conflict, humanitarian threats such as food shortages and outbreak of diseases such as cholera pose a significant challenge," said Agostinho Zacarias, U.N. Development Programme representative in the country. "The recent [cholera] epidemic resulted in 98,592 cumulative cases, including 4,288 deaths between August 2008 and July 2009." Cholera  thrives in areas without clean water and proper sanitation, and the United Nations has said 6 million people in Zimbabwe -- more than half the population -- have limited or no access to safe water and sanitation in rural and urban areas. It also estimates more than 5 million in the nation face starvation. Although the cholera epidemic was declared under control last month, a renewed outbreak is likely, international health officials have said. Zimbabwe's humanitarian situation was worsened by its economic collapse last year. The nation's coalition government, formed six months ago by former political enemies President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, is seeking more than $8 billion to aid its recovery. A U.N. appeal launched earlier this year has so far raised only 44 percent of its goal of $718 million for humanitarian assistance. But Rueben Marumahoko, a Zimbabwe junior minister and an appointee of Mugabe, said the country is no longer in crisis. "There is need for Zimbabwe to move from the humanitarian support stage to the recovery stage," he said. "Zimbabwe is no longer a country in crisis but a country in recovery." The comment drew laughter from many journalists covering the event. Among the nation's problems is a strike by doctors that is almost a month old. The doctors are demanding housing and car allowances and a monthly salary of $1,000 [U.S.] -- a sharp rise from the current $170 a month paid to all public servants. Nurses joined the strike this week, saying that doctors have a genuine case that needs urgent attention. The action is threatening the country's ability to deal with H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu, and to prepare for the possible resurgence of the cholera epidemic.
(CNN)Former Olympic decathlon champion and reality TV star Bruce Jenner was involved in a fatal four-car accident in Southern California on Saturday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Jenner was driving a black Cadillac SUV that was the third vehicle involved in a multiple read-end collision, Sgt. Philip Brooks of the sheriff's department said. The first vehicle was a black Prius that stopped short, CNN affiliate KCAL reported, citing deputies. Behind it was a white Lexus sedan that also hit its brakes. Jenner's Escalade was towing a trailer with an all-terrain vehicle on it when it ran into the Lexus from behind, Brooks said. The Lexus spun into oncoming traffic and was hit by a Hummer H2. The driver of the Lexus was killed. KCAL reported Jenner's SUV left skid marks. The midday wreck came just after noon on Pacific Coast Highway near Corral Canyon Road, the department said in a news release. The sheriff's department later opened a vehicular manslaughter investigation, a source close to the case told CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos. The investigation will focus on everyone in the case, not just one person, the source said. The sheriff's department said on its Facebook page that the surviving drivers were cooperating with investigators. A deputy said Jenner voluntarily took a field sobriety test, was questioned and went home. No information about the deceased was immediately available. Jenner, 65, was not injured in the crash, publicist Alan Nierob said. Pictures posted by TMZ showed Jenner standing by a damaged car talking with a firefighter. Five children and two adults were taken to the hospital with injuries, authorities said. The sheriff's department is still investigating the cause of the accident, the statement said. The accident occurred on a tricky stretch of the highway, where the road is narrow and twisting. In a bizarre twist to the story, a car later drove through safety barriers around the scene and struck two of the cars from the initial accident, Cmdr. Mike Parker of the sheriff's department tweeted. The driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, Parker wrote. Jenner won the 1976 Olympic decathlon with a world record score for the 10-discipline event. He quickly capitalized on his success with Wheaties commercials, appearances and other ventures. He became an actor, appearing in the drama "CHiPs" in 1981 and occasionally playing himself on shows such as "Silver Spoons." He is best known to many television viewers as a member of the cast of the current reality show "Keeping Up With the Kardashians."

She grew up in grinding poverty, losing both her parents at a tender age but 14-year-old whizz-kid Maud Chifamba has defied adversity and hardship to break academic records. Against all odds, the extremely bright teenager has written history as last week she became the youngest ever university student in Zimbabwe -- as well as the whole of southern Africa, according to education officials. Maud, who was born on November 19, 1997, has just started her studies toward a Bachelor of Accountancy Honors Degree at the University of Zimbabwe, the country's oldest and most esteemed educational institution. Her intellectual prowess and hard work have earned her a four-year scholarship of nearly $10,000 after she excelled at last year's Advanced Level exams. Now, one week into her new life at the university, softly-spoken Maud already feels settled. "I'm really enjoying it," she says with striking modesty. "It's better than what I expected. I'm just enjoying all the lectures." Read related: 'The future of Zimbabwe is bright' But before deservedly claiming a spot inside the university's vast lecture halls, finding herself amongst much older students, Zimbabwe's wunderkind had to overcome tremendous financial and social challenges. Born to a poor family in the Hunters resettlement community in Chegutu, central Zimbabwe, Maud lost her father when she was just five years old. Her mother also passed away last year. Her two brothers, who are general workers at a farm, were unable to pay the fees required to keep her at formal school so Maud started studying vigorously at home all by herself. Armed with determination, Maud put all her efforts into studying, embarking on a disciplined reading routine that lasted for several hours each day. "I studied very hard," she remembers. "For the biggest part of the day and even into the night," adds Maud. Maud says the death of her parents made her realize that she would have to take her destiny into her own hands. "It really motivated me to work harder because there was no one to take care of me except myself in the future," says Maud. "That was ... a motivator for me to have something to do with my life." Gifted with natural intelligence, Maud's promising future was apparent from an early age. Her remarkable aptitude impressed her primary school teachers who decided to move her up from Grade 3 to Grade 6. Aged nine, she took her final primary school examinations, where she obtained top marks for all of her subjects. Lacking financial support to undertake her high school education, Maud studied on her own and completed her Ordinary Level in just two years after skipping two forms. Read: How 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future Her hard work paid off last December when she scored 12 points at her A-Level exams, an astonishing feat that earned the 14-year-old girl a place at the Harare-based University of Zimbabwe. "It's phenomenal, especially if you consider that for her A-Levels she was not in formal school," says Gershem Pasi, the commissioner general of the Zimbabwean Revenue Authority, the body that's now sponsoring Maud's university education. "She was just reading by herself at home and her brothers only managed to pay the examination fee." Munyaradzi Madambi, dean of students at the University of Zimbabwe, describes Maud as a "very warm and polite young woman," whose intelligence and maturity shines through. "(She is) confident, efficacious and unique in the sense that you don't normally expect this position among kids from underprivileged backgrounds," he says. Madambi says the university is committed to helping its wonder student develop into a balanced individual while fulfilling her dreams. "We are making sure that she grows up to be a well-moulded, mature adult but of course without really suffocating her or putting her under any pressure," he says. Zimbabwe has an adult literacy rate of 92%, which is one of the highest in Africa, according to UNICEF. Madambi says people in the country have an "incredible and insatiable appetite for education." "Normally those that come from underprivileged backgrounds, their desire is really to work hard and excel and of course Maud is an exceptional case in terms of intellectual prowess," he says. Maud is now on course to conquer even greater heights, becoming Zimbabwe's youngest ever accountant when she graduates in four years time. "My dream job is to become an accountant," she says.

Passengers on a British Airways flight from London to Hong Kong got a scare this week when a recorded announcement said the plane was making an emergency landing. The recording, however, was triggered by a computer glitch -- not by an actual emergency -- and the cabin crew immediately told passengers it had been a mistake, a BA spokesman said Friday. "We would like to apologize to passengers onboard the flight for causing them undue distress," the airline said in a statement. The Sun newspaper reported it happened as the plane, carrying 275 passengers, was over the North Sea. It quoted one passenger who said people were terrified to hear the recording, which said, "This is an emergency announcement. We may shortly need to make an emergency landing on water." CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.
Tragedy has struck ahead of the 2014 Paralympic Games with the death of Australian para-snowboarder Matthew Robinson following a heart attack. The 28-year-old Robinson suffered neck and spinal injuries after a crash in La Molina, a ski resort in Catalonia, Spain, on February 12. His spent eight days in a Barcelona hospital recovering and was then cleared to be flown back to Australia. But during a planned refueling stop in Nairobi, Kenya, Robinson suffered a cardiac arrest and could not be revived. Robinson competed in upper limb impairment disciplines. Although para-snowboarding will make its Paralympic debut in Russia next month, upper limb impairment disciplines will not be contested. Follow all of the action from Sochi 2014 live "The Australian Paralympic Committee (APC) is deeply saddened by the tragic passing of para-snowboarder Matthew Robinson," read an APC statement. "Our thoughts and prayers are with Matthew's parents, his fiancee, his family and his teammates. Our immediate concern is to do everything possible to support them at this extremely sad and difficult time." Robinson suffered from arthrogryposis, a condition which affects joints. "The whole of the Paralympic Movement is deeply saddened by this heart breaking tragedy," International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Philip Craven said in a statement. "Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Matthew's fiancee, family, friends and teammates at this difficult time. "Matthew was a world class and extremely popular athlete, a fact underlined by the vast number of support messages he received from around the world following last week's accident. He sustained his injuries doing the sport he loved most. "The IPC and whole of the Paralympic Movement are in deep mourning at his passing. The Movement is a close knit family and he will be sadly missed by all." The Sochi 2014 Paralympic Games will begin on March 7.
much more so than in West Africa. At least 5,177 people have died of Ebola, most of them in those West African countries, according to the World Health Organization. Sierra Leone has reported nearly 1,200 deaths. The first Ebola patient to die in the United States was Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who traveled to Texas in September. Duncan, 42, died at a Dallas hospital. He initially went to the facility's emergency room after he began having symptoms, but he was misdiagnosed and sent home. Two days later, he was back, tested positive for the virus and began treatment. Complete coverage of Ebola When Salia arrived Saturday at Nebraska Medical Center, he was in "extremely critical" condition, doctors said. His kidneys and respiratory system were failing. Ebola patients must get treatment as early as possible to have a chance at surviving, medical officials say. The doctor received a dose of ZMapp therapy and a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor, doctors said. They did not disclose the donor's identity. The dose of ZMapp that was given to Salia on Saturday was an existing dose that had been provided to another hospital but had not been used, a spokesperson for Mapp Biopharmaceutical said. Your Ebola questions and answers Salia had been able to walk himself onto the plane that transported him from Sierra Leone to the United States, but he was in "very bad" condition, recalled Dent Thompson, vice president of operations for the company that transported the doctor, Phoenix Air. Caregiving between countries Salia split his time between New Carrollton, Maryland, and Sierra Leone, where he worked at a Methodist hospital, CNN affiliate WJZ-TV in Baltimore reported. The team caring for Salia in Sierra Leone characterized him as critical ill, possibly sicker than patients treated successfully in the United States, according to Nebraska health officials. The surgeon had taken a test for Ebola, which came back negative. It's unclear what produced the initial false result. A second test came back positive. Isatu Salia pushed to get her husband evacuated from Sierra Leone, the U.S. State Department said. An air ambulance crew evaluated him in Freetown and determined he was well enough to travel. Isatu Salia spoke to WJZ over the weekend. Too upset to show her face on camera, she described talking to her husband and feeling incredibly concerned. "I know he's sick. He was a little slow talking," she said, breaking down in tears. "I'm worried for him." A reporter asked if she was confident her husband would get the treatment he desperately needed. She said she did and she was "pleased" with the action the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took when she phoned authorities there. It was an "hour-by-hour situation" when the ill surgeon arrived at Nebraska Medical Center, according to Dr. Phil Smith, director of the hospital's biocontainment unit. How the Ebola virus spreads A man who gave selflessly Maada Salia spoke admiringly of his father over the weekend. "The fact that he would go back to his country and help is one thing that really amazed me because he showed the love that he has for his country," the son said. "He doesn't think of himself as someone important. He puts himself down and helps those who really need help." The White House released a statement of condolences to the Salia family. "Dr. Salia dedicated his life to saving others. He viewed this vocation as his calling, telling his fellow United Methodist Church members that he pursued medicine not because he wanted to, but because he firmly believed it was God's will for him," the statement reads. "Dr. Salia's passing is another reminder of the human toll of this disease and of the continued imperative to tackle this epidemic on the frontlines, where Dr. Salia was engaged in his calling."

Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is some authority to bring pirates to justice, according to the commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. U.S. Vice Admiral William Gortney: Need to hold pirates off Africa's east coast accountable. Because there is no working government in Somalia and no country is willing to take captured pirates, bring them to trial and detain them, there is no deterrent for pirates to stop attacking ships, Vice Admiral William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday. "The problem is there's not a way to -- until we have a mechanism [to hold them] accountable and try them for their actions, there's no way to -- to finish the problem," Gortney said. The United States is making a deal with a country in the eastern Africa region to hold and try pirates captured by the U.S.-led Combined Task Force 151, a new maritime anti-piracy mission started earlier this month. He said an official announcement would be made after the deal with the country is official. In the past three months, piracy attacks have averaged about 12 to 14 a month off the east coast of Africa. As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney. "That [number] should tell you that we're not -- we're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt. And that's where we have to go after," Gortney said. The United States is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force, but at the moment, the United States is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of Somalia. There are ships from some European and Asian countries patrolling the waters independently as well, primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 » Pirating off of Somalia has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing. Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country. Gortney said statistically the chances of ships being pirated off of Somalia less than one percent, but it won't be stopped until piracy is "disincentivized."
and because she and Christian are both incredibly intelligent, confident, and can spar with each other on every level. I auditioned for two months. I met with Sam a bunch of times. So when I found out I had the part, I think I started crying. I was relieved the not-knowing was over. Click here to view a "50 Shades" slideshow on Glamour.com SAM TAYLOR-JOHNSON: Dakota was everything that I wanted in Anastasia. She has a strong sense of who she is, but at the same time there's a sweetness about her. It was tough to find Christian because, on the page, he's perfect. In real life there aren't so many people that tick all those boxes: to be able to be charismatic and charming, successful, wealthy, and devastatingly handsome. JAMIE DORNAN: At first, I didn't audition. I made a tape in London with a casting director. I didn't hear anything until they cast Charlie (Hunnam). I thought it was kind of funny to say that I'd auditioned to play Christian and failed miserably. Then whatever happened with (Hunnam) happened, and the doors opened again. Click here to watch a behind-the-scenes video interview of Johnson and Dornan on Glamour.com On becoming Anastasia and Christian ... JAMIE: I had to do a lot of work to get in shape because Christian's someone who's very anal about that. But it wasn't six hours a day. You don't want to turn to your heavily pregnant wife and say, "I'm going to the gym for six hours. Text me if you go into labor." DAKOTA: Jamie and I actually shared a trainer. It was important to me that Ana's body look like that of an active college student. And I was going be naked, so I wanted to look good. I did a lot of working out and had more waxing than any woman should have! Glamour.com: 27 Cringeworthy Fashion DON'Ts JAMIE: In that six weeks before filming, my daughter was born. It was just an insane time. For research, one rainy Tuesday evening, I kissed the wife and baby good night and went to watch a dominant-submissive session in a dungeon. The dominant was our sort of adviser on the job. He'd be on hand anytime there was a scene in the Red Room (Christian's playroom for bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism), to say, "You're doing that wrong." So I watched him do his thing. ... It was quite jovial, a very different approach to how I saw Christian being in the Red Room. I think Christian takes it a bit more seriously. DAKOTA: I didn't go to the sex dungeon. I wanted to keep myself distanced from it at first because I wanted Ana's reaction to certain things to be completely honest and real, like new. But I did do a lot of reading about the culture of BDSM. It's about the ebb and flow of control between two people. To me, there's something really honest in wanting to completely give up control for just a second. Glamour.com: Carrie Underwood's Workout Moves for Miniskirt-Ready Legs On entering the Red Room ... DAKOTA: The scenes in that room were definitely the most vulnerable scenes in the movie. But it was a very closed set -- my mom told me that it's my right to ask for that during intimate scenes, so it seemed like (Jamie and Sam and I) were in this little world together. JAMIE: Some of the Red Room stuff was uncomfortable. There were times when Dakota was not wearing much, and I had to do stuff to her that I'd never choose to do to a woman. Glamour.com: 46 Brand-New Wedding Dresses That Will Make Your Heart Sing DAKOTA: It's stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene. But then they call cut, and you're still tied to the bed, naked. Jamie would be the first one to throw a blanket over me. JAMIE: I felt very protective and aware that it probably wasn't easy for her to be put in those situations, and exposed. And Sam, as a director, has an amazing quality of making everyone feel very relaxed. SAM: We left anything that was emotionally difficult or of a sexual nature until the last few weeks of filming. By that point we had time to get to know each other, to build that trust, which was important to be able to go into the next realm. Those days on set were calm, but you could definitely feel tension. Glamour.com: 25 Celebrity Hairstyles that Will Make You Want Bangs On fans, haters and the countdown to megastardom ... JAMIE: I (already) get, "Oh my God, you're Christian Grey!" (out in public). And I say, "No, I'm Jamie! I'm an actor." When the film comes out, there will probably be more of that. I don't think you can prepare for that. You can't put up sandbags, get rations in. I just live my life. I've had the same friends since I was a small boy. None of them do what I do or, frankly, give a sh*t about what I do. We just love each other. The one thing I take comfort in is that none of that is going anywhere, no matter what the perception of me is or what happens in my career. DAKOTA: I'm proud of (the movie). I completely disagree with people who think Ana's weak. I think she's actually stronger than he is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that. My mom came up for a day [during filming]. She's proud of me. But I don't want my family to see [the movie], because it's inappropriate. Or my brothers' friends, who I grew up with. I think they'd be like, Blegh (mimics vomiting). Also there's part of me that's like, I don't want anyone to see this movie. Just kidding. On their turn-ons ... JAMIE: I've got a thing for great hands. My wife (Amelia Warner) has my favorite hands in the world. Being from Northern Ireland, I'm programmed to enjoy stories, so I find it sexy if a woman can tell a funny story. And I've always found attractive talking to someone who's achieved something that I couldn't. DAKOTA: Like Jamie, I like good hands. Manly hands. I grew up in Colorado, and there are manly men there, so manliness is attractive to me. I think it's unsexy when a man chews with his mouth open or when a man is rude or wears fedoras. I hate fedoras. Oh God, I can find more things I hate about men than I like. I think it's just a phase! Glamour.com: 10 Things He's Thinking When You're Naked

A missing 12-year-old girl has been found safe after authorities discovered the bodies of the couple she lived with, Arkansas police said. Amber Whitlow was found Saturday night in Memphis, Tennessee, local police said. She was found with her 33-year-old brother, Antonio Whitlow, who is a suspect in her abduction as well as a double homicide, Memphis police spokeswoman Alyssa Moore said. Antonio Whitlow is in custody, Moore said. Amber was taken to a children's hospital as a precaution, and the Tennessee and Arkansas departments of child services were notified. Earlier Saturday, the man and woman whom Amber lived with were found dead inside a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, police said. Authorities received a call from a man who attended the same church as the slain couple and had found the woman just inside the home's doorway, Sgt. Cassandra Davis said. Officers investigated and found that woman and the dead man, who was further inside the residence. Both of the deceased were in their 60s, Davis said. Authorities have not released the names of the couple, nor have they indicated how they died. But Davis said Amber is either the daughter or granddaughter of the deceased couple.

Websites affiliated with the CIA, Mexico's mining ministry and the state of Alabama were down Friday, allegedly done in by hackers, government officials and a well-known hacking group reported. A message Friday on a Twitter page and Tumblr feed affiliated with the hacking group known as Anonymous celebrated that the Central Intelligence Agency's website had been taken down. The posting read: "CIA TANGO DOWN: https://www.cia.gov/ #Anonymous." A later one pointed to a news story indicating "#Anonymous hackers hit CIA, U.N., Mexico websites." Numerous outside reports indicated the CIA's website was down, and CNN's attempts from late Friday afternoon into the evening to get onto the site failed. Asked about the outage, CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said Friday night, "We are aware of the problems accessing our website, and are working to resolve them." By early Saturday morning, the website was back. Who is Anonymous? Everyone and no one Additionally, information was "compromised" in a hacking of Alabama state websites, the Alabama Department of Homeland Security said in a news release. "We are aware of the current situation regarding individual(s) claiming responsibility for hacking into a state of Alabama ... public website," Alabama Department of Homeland Security Director Spencer Collier said in the release. Jack Doane, director of Alabama's Information Services Division, told CNN later by e-mail that state technology experts "are conducting a forensic analysis to determine what if any information has been compromised." It was not immediately clear what websites were hacked or who was responsible. A web page that included Anonymous' signature tag line stated the hacking was in response to Alabama's "recent racist legislation in an attempt to punish immigrants as criminals" -- referring to legislation, signed last June, aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration in the state. The Anonymous-related Twitter page also provided links to documents, messages and other files that it said it had taken off a website tied to Mexico's mining ministry. "Hello Mexican Chamber of Mines," a related Twitter post read. "Want to see your emails exposed?" That said, another later item on the same feed added, "We'd remind media that if we report a hack or ddos (distributed denial of service) attack, it doesn't necessarily mean we did it...FYI." The Mexican mining ministry's website -- which is distinct from the Chamber of Mines, or Caminex, a trade association -- appeared to be down early Friday evening. CNN's Barbara Starr and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.
Doctors at the Houston hospital where U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was transferred said that while she remains in intensive care, she has surprised them with the progress she has already made. Giffords, 40, who was shot in the head at a public event in Arizona on January 8, was transferred Friday to Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. It was thought the congresswoman would begin rehabilitation at The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) Memorial Hermann, but officials said she was taken instead to the hospital's trauma center for evaluation and treatment. "She's not quite ready for rehabilitation yet," Dr. Dong Kim of Memorial Hermann told CNN on Thursday. Kim would not elaborate, but on Friday, Dr. John Holcomb told reporters that Giffords has fluid on her brain. "There's a little fluid collection that the docs have put a drain into, around her brain, and that drain is still in place," he said. "With that drain in place, she can't leave the ICU." He said Giffords will remain in the hospital while "this drain business" is sorted out and doctors make sure no infection is developing. During that time, she will undergo rehabilitation in the intensive care unit, as she was at Tucson, Arizona's University Medical Center. That rehabilitation was under way on Saturday, Dr. Gerard Francisco, the hospital's medical director, told reporters. "She's doing very well," he said. The exercises involve moving, sitting and standing, he said. "We're still in that phase of discovering what she can and cannot do so we can come up with the best combination of therapy." Giffords "surprised us," he said. "She did not need as much assistance as we anticipated." Doctors had said earlier that Giffords has been able to stand with assistance. "She's activating her muscles even more than what I had anticipated," Francisco said. Giffords has a breathing tube in her neck and cannot talk, but Francisco said he believes she is trying to communicate. She is very responsive to others, and follows commands. He said doctors were particularly encouraged by Giffords' bringing her left leg, which was dangling off the side of the bed, up onto the bed. Giffords has good movement and muscle tone on her left side, he said, and some on her right side as well, although not as much as the left. She was shot in the left side of her brain, which controls her right side. Arizona doctors said Giffords' transfer went flawlessly. Dr. Randall Friese of the UMC trauma center said that at some points as she traveled through the streets of Tucson, Giffords could hear applause from those who turned out to honor her. "She responded very well to that," he said, smiling and even tearing up a bit. "It was very emotional." Six people died in the shooting at a Tucson supermarket earlier this month, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl. A total of 19 people were shot. Giffords is the only one who remains hospitalized. Police said they believe suspect Jared Lee Loughner, 22, targeted Giffords in the attack. Loughner is in custody and facing federal charges. Despite reaching a series of milestones, Giffords has a long road ahead, doctors have said. Once she enters rehabilitation, the process is expected to take four to six months.

A child has died after contracting a rare but deadly brain-eating amoeba infection while visiting a home in Louisiana, according to state health officials. Officials believe the child is a 4-year-old boy from Mississippi who may have come in contact with the waterborne Naegleria fowleri amoeba while playing on a plastic toy water slide, St. Bernard Parish President David Peralta told CNN affiliate WWLTV. Water samples taken from the home tested positive for the amoeba, according to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. The state health department has not released the child's age or identity. Out of what officials describe as "an abundance of caution," St. Bernard Parish on Thursday began treating its water system with additional chlorine and flushing any potentially contaminated water from its lines. This treatment may result in changes in the smell, taste and color of the local water, the health department said, but it is still safe to drink. While initial tests for the amoeba were negative, the health department said tests showed low levels of chlorine in some areas of the water supply. "We are working with the parish to make sure precautionary measures are being taken while we await additional test results on samples taken from the area's water system," Assistant Secretary for Public Health J.T. Lane said in a statement. The health department said the amoeba results may take up to a month to confirm. The Mississippi boy's death is the second widely reported loss of a child due to Naegleria fowleri in less than two weeks. Last month, the same parasite killed Zachary Reyna, a 12-year-old from Florida. A third child, 12-year-old Kali Hardig from Arkansas, survived the infection that struck her after she contracted the amoeba in July. Between 2001 and 2010, there were only 32 reported cases of people getting Naegleria fowleri in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the cases have been in the Southeast. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm freshwater, most often in the Southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water, the CDC said. "This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of," Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali's case. "Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die." The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. "Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations," the agency website says. "After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."
Noted author and social activist Howard Zinn died of a heart attack Wednesday while traveling, his daughter, Myla Kabat-Zinn, said. Zinn, author of "A People's History of the United States," was 87. Kabat-Zinn said her father, who lived in Auburndale, Massachusetts," died while traveling in Santa Monica, California. "A People's History of the United States," first published in 1980, tells a history not often in seen in other books -- from the perspective of those not in a seat of power. The book was the inspiration for a 2009 documentary, narrated by Zinn, called "The People Speak." The film highlighted people who spoke up for social change, according to the Web site of the History Channel, which aired the program. Zinn was a shipyard worker and Air Force bombardier before he went to college under the GI Bill and received a Ph.D. from Columbia University, according to his Web site. He taught at numerous universities, including Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, and Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. Kabat-Zinn said of her father that he lived a "very full and exciting life" and that there were many social issues that were very important to him. Above all, she said, her father believed that there is no "just war." Zinn's death on the day of President Obama's first State of the Union address was underscored by his contribution to a recently released special from The Nation magazine called "Obama at One." "I've been searching hard for a highlight," he wrote. "The only thing that comes close is some of Obama's rhetoric; I don't see any kind of a highlight in his actions and policies." Zinn said he was not "terribly disappointed because I didn't expect that much," noting that he has been "a traditional Democratic president" on foreign policy -- "hardly any different from a Republican" -- and has been cautious in domestic policy. "On health care, for example, he starts out with a compromise, and when you start out with a compromise, you end with a compromise of a compromise, which is where we are now," Zinn said. Zinn also cautioned "that Obama is going to be a mediocre president -- which means, in our time, a dangerous president -- unless there is some national movement to push him in a better direction."
Siri, Mars, Mac and Luna. I'm not talking Apple products or planetary terms. These are baby names. And not just any baby names but ones that have jumped in popularity in 2012, according to Baby Center.com's just released list. Baby Siri? Seriously, who would name their bundle of joy after a frustrating Apple product that hardly ever works? And speaking of Apple (see daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin,) that name moved up a whopping 585 places on the list of names for girls born in 2012. So there could conceivably be a family out there with a daughter named Apple and a son named Siri. (Hope that entitles the family to a discount on an iMac.) There was a time when bizarre baby naming was something only celebrities did to their kids (as if being the child of a celebrity wasn't challenging enough). There's Beyonce and Jay Z's Blue Ivy, Penn Jillette's son, Moxie Crimefighter, Bono's daughter Memphis Eve, actor Jason Lee's son Pilot Inspektor, and the list goes on and on. But now this "condition" is apparently spreading to the rest of us. In addition to the offbeat names above, 2011 saw babies sporting such names as: Moo, Draper, Graceland and Tequila. There are even media reports that this past weekend some parents allegedly named their newborn daughter, Hashtag. That one may turn out to be an Internet hoax, but after last year's story of a child in Egypt being named Facebook (in praise of the role Facebook played in the Egyptian revolution), we can't be too far from babies named Retweet and Spam Blocker anyway. It truly is only a matter of time until you meet a kid named DVR or Playstation 3. Apparently some parents believe that giving their child a jaw-dropping name will make him or her more distinctive. News flash: it's not the name that makes your child stand out, it's his or her achievements. While I don't want to rain on creativity, let's be honest -- these weird names are more about parents showing off their "cleverness" than about finding a name that fits the child. It's not like the parents got to know the child first for a few months and then said, "You know this baby really is a little Siri." And do these parents even consider that a baby's name can cause consequences for the child that the parents never imagined, and in many areas of the child's life? When I reflect upon my own name, I realize that my life could have been far different if my parents had followed their initial instincts when naming me. My Palestinian father wanted to name me Saladin after the famous Muslim leader, while my Sicilian mother wanted to name me Dino. Instead they compromised on Dean. Growing up in North Jersey, Dean was not a common name. But it actually made me feel different in a good way being the only Dean in my class. And even today in looking at the list of baby names for 2012, I was actually happy that Dean was not in the top 100. Still, the truth is, if I'd been named Dino, I would have certainly been viewed as more ethnic by teachers, potential employers and co-workers. I would have been required to continually overcome cultural stereotypes. And if I'd been named the very Arabic Saladin Obeidallah, you could just imagine all the "fun" I would have had in post-9/11 America. I would have likely volunteered for "random" security checks at the airport to make it easier for all involved or simply got used to taking the bus cross country. But there's a difference between a name that isn't overly common and naming your child after your favorite appliance. A name is a big part of a kid's identity. It can trigger impressions about a child even before we meet him or her -- a particular problem among the closed-minded of the world, but this is the world your child will have to navigate. For example, studies have found that children with names that linguistically sound like they come from a lower socioeconomic status are less likely to be recommended by school officials for gifted classes and actually more likely to be labeled as learning disabled. Other research has revealed that boys with feminine sounding names -- such as Shannon or Ashley -- have had more disciplinary problems in school because of their response to teasing. Still other studies have found a link between how much people like their own names and their level of self-esteem. So, parents, keep in mind that your choice of name will have a lasting impact on your child -- both for good and bad. And if you insist on picking a bizarre name for the baby, then I propose that your child be empowered to rename you with any name he or she chooses. At least then it's fair that a child named Hashtag has parents named Angry Birds and YouTube. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.
Behind nearly every American tragedy is a conspiracy theory. Think JFK's assassination, even the 9/11 attacks. So it's no surprise that there have been similar doubts that a fuel tank explosion caused the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800, killing all 230 people aboard. That was the government's ruling, yet it never quelled the theory that a missile strike brought down the plane off the coast of Long Island, New York. So why is an upcoming documentary set to air on an obscure cable channel that rehashes this theory getting so much attention this week? "TWA Flight 800" is based on the claims of former federal investigators who took part in the initial probe and witnesses who say their accounts were not taken seriously. They want a do-over. Hank Hughes, who was the National Transportation Safety Board's senior accident investigator for TWA 800, is among the ex-investigators featured in the documentary calling for a new probe into what caused the crash. He said the NTSB's final report on the crash ignored witnesses, misinterpreted bomb residue and misanalyzed radar data. Bottom line, according to the documentary producers: "One or more ordnance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash." The documentary does not identify or speculate about who fired the ordnance; it says only that they most likely were launched from the waters off Long Island. They are hoping that the NTSB, the nation's top investigative agency for plane crashes, will determine that by reopening the investigation into TWA 800. All this is fueling suspicion that has been around for years about a possible cover-up. One story that surfaced shortly after the crash laid out an elaborate conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by a U.S. Navy "friendly fire" incident that was followed by a huge government cover-up. The report was co-authored by Ian Goddard, Mike Sommers and the late former ABC News reporter Pierre Salinger. Goddard later apologized for the report, saying "my effort to pin the crash ... on the Navy was reckless and a mistake." Related: Still 'paranoid' after all these years Conspiracy talk gets people's attention. As CNN commenter RUDucky2 points out: "Conspiracies are very comforting creatures." They give society "bad guys to hunt." And any proof that contradicts the conspiracy "becomes more 'proof' that there's a conspiracy." And colleagues of the ex-investigators featured in the documentary fear this is nothing more than an effort to stir up conspiracy theories. "I would never be part of any cover-up. Period," former NTSB official John Goglia told CNN. Goglia, who served on the five-member NTSB during the investigation, said he "took offense" at any suggestion that his team ignored evidence. None of the evidence detailing how the plane fell apart supports the missile theory, he said. It's not like the missile theory was dismissed at the outset, said the top FBI investigator on the case, James Kallstrom. "We took the ... possibility a missile brought down the plane very, very seriously," Kallstrom told CNN. "We we're 99% sure that this was not a terrorist." But what about that remaining 1%? There are parts of the investigation that can point "any way you want," Goglia said. But most importantly, he said, the pieces of the puzzle have to be judged "as a whole." How about the former investigators in the documentary who are calling for a new probe? Do they stand to gain anything from all this? "There's no motive in this other than we want to get it straight," said Hughes, who wrote a petition asking the NTSB to reopen its investigation. "It's a matter of personal integrity for us ... we have nothing to gain financially or otherwise..." Read the petition Kallstrom said he doesn't question Hughes' motives, but he added, "I just wished if someone felt that strongly about speaking like that, they could have brought it to someone's attention ... commencing with the investigation -- not wait 17 years until they get their pensions in their pockets and then come out with it." Longtime aviation journalist Sylvia Adcock thought one point was worth noting: The documentary boasts that "investigators finally break their silence." That's interesting because, Adcock says, one of the investigators actually testified during a Senate hearing in 1999. "It would seem that if he had something more pertinent to say he would have said it long ago," Adcock wrote in her CNN opinion piece. Much of the documentary -- which was made available to the media before its July 17 premiere -- rests its theory on an analysis of the evidence by the film's co-producer, Tom Stalcup, who was not involved in the probe. A longtime and passionate critic of the official investigation, Stalcup has been vexed by witness accounts that are at odds with the fuel tank explosion theory. Of course if the disaster happened today, the world would weigh in almost immediately on what witnesses saw based on countless smartphone videos of the blast that would pop up online. So, will the NTSB have to go back to square one all these years later? Kallstrom -- a former FBI assistant director -- said he wouldn't be opposed to the FBI joining with the NTSB to take another look at the case. The agency told CNN it has received Hughes' petition and "will respond to the petitioners once a determination is made." The NTSB noted that petitions must be based on new evidence or "on a showing that the Board's findings are erroneous." New evidence? The basic claim that a missile hit the plane isn't new, wrote Adcock. The radar data doesn't appear to be new either, according to journalist James Polk, one of CNN's lead producers covering the disaster. "As far as I can tell from reading the petition, there's no new evidence," Polk said. "But their alternative interpretation of existing evidence and their assumptions alone probably will not be sufficient to persuade the NTSB to start all over again from scratch." Whatever comes out of all this, it's unlikely to smother the debate and the conspiracy theories swirling around one of aviation history's most mysterious plane crashes.
the U.S., UK, France, Russia, China and Germany -- announced plans to fly to Geneva and join the marathon talks, many Iranians felt an agreement on the first stage of a broader deal was near. "I really thought there was going to be a deal, but all of a sudden it fell apart," said taxi driver Alireza Hashemi. The talks in Geneva were held behind closed doors with remarkable secrecy. Two U.S. administration officials told CNN that under a potential deal, Iran would halt enriching uranium to 20% -- a key step on the path to a nuclear weapon -- and render unusable most of its existing stockpile of higher enriched uranium. But rumors and reports swirled about possible divisions among the P5+1 countries -- with some members pushing for Iran to offer more, including a guarantee not to activate its heavy water reactor in Arak. What ultimately spoiled an agreement remains unclear, but many Iranians took to social media to blame French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. Shortly after arriving in Geneva, Fabius warned against signing a "sucker's deal" with Iran and told a French radio station: "It is necessary to take fully into account Israel's security concerns." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the proposed agreement a "bad deal for peace," and said: "Iran is not required to take apart even one centrifuge. But the international community is relieving sanctions on Iran for the first time after many years. Iran gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing." Read more: Why U.S. and Israel are split on Iran deal Suddenly, due to ordinary Iranians' anger with Fabius, it seemed the U.S. government was no longer public enemy number one in Tehran. "History won't forget your hostility," Omid Mousavi wrote on the French FM's Facebook page. "We hope for Iranian and American pride and Chevrolets instead of Peugeots." And Mohammad Reza Ghasemi wrote: "I was always respectful of people who come from France. But you have already spoiled it for me. Can you make it clear for us whether you are Foreign Minister of France or Israel?" Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif didn't mention any names but appeared to confirm on his Facebook page that the deal was blocked by a single member of the P5+1. "The possibility of reaching an agreement with the P5 +1 existed but it was necessary for everyone to be on the same path, and you heard from public remarks from the ministers that one of the delegations had some problems," Zarif wrote on his Facebook page. Representatives from Iran and the P5+1 are scheduled to meet again in Geneva on November 20 in another attempt to resolve a decade long dispute over Iran's nuclear program.

"The little wisdom I have tells me there are things happening behind closed doors that we're not aware of," says store clerk Amir Ghassemi. "But we've learned to live with hope."
1. Da Vinci's clockwork car A working model of Leonardo Da Vinci's car on display in 2004 at the Museum of the History of Science in Florence, Italy. Leonardo da Vinci is renowned for his forward-thinking sketches and intricate designs, which included blueprints for a bicycle, a submarine, and a helicopter. But you can't win 'em all. Da Vinci also designed a three-wheeled wagon-like device -- often referred to as the clockwork car -- that never really lived up to the hype. Its spring-operated design makes it the first-known concept for a self-propelled vehicle. And because it was designed without a driver's seat (though a secondary steering column was present) and was meant to be programmed along a specific course, the clockwork car is also thought to be one of the world's first robots. Some speculate that faulty interpretations of da Vinci's notes prevented the success of his ideas, but there's plenty of evidence to the contrary. When engineers finally constructed a working model of the car in the late 1990s, it only traveled 40 feet. 2. The monowheel In 1869, French craftsman Rousseau of Marseilles built the first in history's line of unsuccessful monocycles. Sitting inside the monowheel, a rider steered the contraption by shifting his or her weight in the desired direction. As if that wasn't difficult enough, the massive outer wheel remained directly in the rider's line of sight at all times. Braking was also potentially hazardous, as stopping too abruptly would cause the rider to be propelled forward along with the outer wheel. But perhaps the biggest strike against the monowheel was the immediate comparison of any rider to a gerbil -- something even the French wouldn't tolerate. 3. The Daihatsu Trek It's a car! It's a bed! It looks suspiciously like a child's toy! For the outdoorsman who has everything except a really expensive Big Wheel, there was the Daihatsu Trek. A single-passenger off-road vehicle, the Trek not only allowed drivers to travel to remote areas, it also gave them a place to bed down for the evening. With its collapsible seat, steering wheel, and roll bar, the boxy monstrosity from 1990 offered all the comforts of a really cheap motel room. And while we can't be sure why the car never made it past the concept stage at Daihatsu, we can only guess members of the off-road focus groups felt silly driving a Transformer. 4. The Avrocar A quasi hot potato of international engineering, the Avrocar was initially funded by the Canadian government, designed by a British engineer, and eventually assumed by the U.S. Defense Department as part of the Cold War weapons race. The UFO-like contraption was 18 feet in diameter, but only 3 feet thick. It featured vertical takeoff and landing and was designed to reach speeds up to 300 mph while remaining elusive to radar. Unfortunately, the two-person craft was never able to stabilize at heights above 8 feet, nor travel faster than 35 mph. After eight years and more than $10 million, the project was abandoned in 1960. 5. The Dymaxion Buckminster Fuller was many things --inventor, philosopher, Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and bearer of a name that makes Frank Zappa's kids feel average. Among his many architectural and engineering creations, Bucky tried his hand at automobiles. In 1933, using a V-8 engine loaned to him by Henry Ford, Fuller built the Dymaxion car. Truly a wonder to behold, the Dymaxion was nearly 20 feet long, got 30-plus miles to the gallon, held up to 12 people, had a maximum speed of 120 mph, and could do a U-turn in 20 feet, thanks to a single rear wheel that controlled the steering. Unfortunately, the car's steering appears to be at fault for a fatal accident at the 1933 World's Fair, when the Dymaxion was rubbernecked by another car. Although later evidence placed fault on the driver of the other car, negative publicity surrounding the wreck caused investors to pull away from the project, and Fuller was freed up to build geodesic domes and work on his friendship with John Denver. The fortunate outcome of the Dymaxion's failure? Denver's hit tune, "What One Man Can Do," which was written for Fuller. 6. The KAZ Originally designed in 2001 to push the limits of electric automotive technology, the KAZ (Keio Advanced Zero-emission) vehicle is part science-fiction, part sports car, part limousine, and entirely unattractive. But the beauty of the KAZ lies in its eight wheels, each powered by its own battery, which allow the luxury concept car to reach speeds in excess of 190 mph without emitting any pollution. The car's design also makes for a safe ride because what would normally be the engine compartment is a crushable zone, reducing risk to the driver. Sadly, the KAZ came off as less luxury automobile and more cartoon, sending the designers back to their drawing boards.

Ukraine's embattled government has agreed to scrap harsh laws limiting protests and give amnesty to demonstrators who seized the Justice Ministry headquarters, a top official announced late Monday. With Ukraine's political crisis deepening, protesters left the ministry after Justice Minister Olena Lukash warned that she would call for a state of emergency. But at the end of the day, Lukash said the anti-protest laws that went into effect on January 16 would be repealed and the protesters who occupied her ministry would receive amnesty -- as long as they cleared out of "all seized premises and roads." The statement came after another round of talks between the government of President Viktor Yanukovych and an opposition whose followers have massed in and around central Kiev's Maidan Square to demand Yanukovych's ouster and new elections. Police and protesters have fought pitched battles in the streets, leaving scores injured and several dead. Anti-government demonstrators seized the Justice Ministry building on Sunday night. They cleared out Monday after Lukash threatened to impose a state of emergency -- a step opposition spokeswoman Lesya Orobets warned could lead to the use of military units to suppress protests. "We as an opposition spent the whole day trying to negotiate with people who actually captured the premises to get out of there, not to give them any legal base for a state of emergency," Orobets told CNN's Amanpour program. Oleksandr Danylyuk, the leader of one of the protest factions, said the groups retreated to avert difficulties in negotiations between the government and opposition. But while the protesters left the ministry, they remained outside, where a sign and front window were smashed, creating a blockade. They jumped up and down, thumping sticks on the ground and shouting, "Bandits out." The violence that has rattled Kiev for weeks spread outside the capital Sunday, with reports of protesters seizing municipal headquarters in other towns. Ukraine's parliament was expected to hold a special session on the protests Tuesday, and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, was headed for Kiev in a bid to help defuse the standoff. Ashton urged the government not to impose a state of emergency, saying the move "would trigger a further downward spiral for Ukraine, which would benefit no one." "What is urgently needed is a genuine dialogue to build a new consensus on the way forward," Ashton said in a written statement late Monday. "I hope that the Ukrainian parliament will set a clear path during tomorrow's session towards a political solution. This must include revoking the package of laws passed on 16 January." And U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Yanukovych on Monday night to reiterate American support for "a peaceful, political solution to the crisis," the White House said. "Underscoring that no time should be lost, the vice president urged President Yanukovych to pull back riot police and work with the opposition on immediate measures to de-escalate tensions between protesters and the government," a White House readout of the call stated. "He also urged the government to take concrete steps during tomorrow's parliamentary session to respond to the full and legitimate concerns of the Ukrainian people, including by repealing the anti-democratic laws passed on January 16." Ukraine opposition rejects president's offer; protestor mourned Government offer rejected Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, is home to 45 million people. The clashes there are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead. Among the snowy rooftops of Kiev, smoke can often be seen billowing from the city center, where thousands of demonstrators have massed despite freezing weather, setting up makeshift barricades and bombarding police with gasoline bombs. Scenes of fires, burnt tires, smashed windows and the drumbeats of sticks on corrugated metal have become familiar occurrences on the city's central arteries. More recently, protesters, old and young, have been voicing their anger about anti-protest laws passed this month. The controversial new laws have sparked concerns that they could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech. They're also calling for changes to the country's constitution. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, imprisoned since 2010 on charges the United States and Europe have called politically motivated, called on the opposition to remain firm in a statement Monday evening. "The people of Ukraine went out onto the Maidan not for the opposition leaders to be given government posts, and not even for revoking of the dictatorial laws," Tymoshenko said. "The people want fundamental changes in their lives, justice in Ukraine and a path to European values. This is their last chance." Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk has refused Yanukovich's offer to be prime minister, Lukash said Monday night. Yatsenyuk, who heads the Fatherland Party, would have become the prime minister and would have been able to dismiss the current government, which has been one of the protesters' demands. Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, the former heavyweight boxing champion, said Sunday that he had rejected the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues. His announcement was greeted by loud cheers from the crowd -- but his Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party, or UDAR, said it was ready to continue negotiations with the government. Yanukovych also said he would agree to a working group to look at changes to the constitution, according to the President's website. Read more: Is Ukraine becoming a dictatorship?

A leader of the Gulf drug cartel -- Antonio Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, also known as "Tony the Storm" -- died during a clash with security forces in the border city of Matamoros, Alejandro Poire, security spokesman for the Mexican government, said Friday. Three other suspected criminals and two members of the Mexican navy also died in the fighting, he said. The Gulf cartel is one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking organizations. It is based in Matamoros, which is across the border from Brownsville, Texas. "Today was another significant step in the destruction of criminal organizations that have done so much to damage the people of this country," Poire said. The University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College canceled classes through Saturday and said it would rework several weekend events "because of gunfire taking place across the Rio Grande." Most of the students and faculty members have gone home, said Letty Fernandez, a university spokeswoman. The campus is about half a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border. Sgt. Reynaldo Trevino, with the university police, said he was working at a soccer game when he heard gunfire break out. He said the gunshots sounded so close it was "like we were there." More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon intensified the government's fight against cartels and organized crime after taking office in 2006, according to government figures. Authorities have scored a string of important wins against drug cartels recently. In September, officials arrested Sergio Villarreal, known to Mexican officials as "El Grande," an alleged top leader of the Beltran Leyva cartel. His capture came soon after the August arrest of American-born "La Barbie," or Edgar Valdez, thought to be one of Mexico's most ruthless drug traffickers. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.
"We struggled so much in life," says Olga Moran, a wife and mother of three from an impoverished village near Otavalo, Ecuador. "We made very little. It wasn't enough. So, one day we started making necklaces with seeds," she said. Moran says that with the help of American entrepreneur Amanda Judge, she has turned her life around, selling her jewelry in the United States, making her family better off. For Judge, The Andean Collection started as an academic project as she researched ways to help women out of poverty in rural Ecuadorian villages. "I didn't see ways to increase the income in agriculture or farming, carpentry," Judge said. "However, I did see income potential in crafts." She has encouraged the artisans to experiment with new designs which she believed would allow her to expand the business from local to international markets. In 2008, the theory went into practice. "They don't live hand to mouth any more. They have savings, they have consumer goods, they have TVs, they have cars," Judge said. "They work from their homes, they don't have to get up and carry bags of 10 pounds of grain to the market...and come back only when they have sold enough to eat for the day." The business has changed Moran's life. "I spend time with my children, my husband, my home. I couldn't do that before," Moran said. And with more means, she hopes to offer her children a better life. In the future she hopes that they can go on to study, so they won't have to endure what she has. Judge says all the accessories in the Andean Collection are made with local seeds harvested in the Ecuadorian rainforest and lowlands. "The three main types are acai, tambi and tagua," she said. "Using these natural materials promotes harvest growth because it allows the farmers who harvest the seeds to get a living out of their lands -- instead of selling the land to oil companies or logging it for the wood. "So it actually promotes forest growth." Judge now works with 40 artisans and besides bringing social change to their families she has seen her business take off. Chic and green, these accessories are now being sold in 1,500 stores worldwide, as well as making a difference to the lives of the people who make them -- Moran included. "I am so grateful. I don't know how to express it," Moran said.
­A patchwork of blood-red welts and purple bruises cover Ramy Essam's back, from his neck down to his thighs. His scars are evidence, he said, that violent groups linked to ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime are trying to subvert the revolution. "There are still some people from the corrupt old regime trying to crush the revolution," Essam said, lying face down on his bed, where he has spent days waiting for his wounds to heal. "With God's will, the revolution will continue." The 23-year-old student and musician said thugs attacked him and hundreds of others at a peaceful sit-in at Tahrir Square on March 9. Egyptian soldiers were on guard but they didn't come to his rescue. Instead, Essam said, they detained him and scores of others and hauled him to the nearby Egyptian museum where uniformed soldiers tortured him for four hours and cut off his shoulder-length hair. "It was pain I never imagined I would feel in my life," Essam said. "They took off my clothes. They used sticks, metal rods, wires, whips." He received electric shocks, he said. "There was a soldier who would jump in the air and land on my face with his legs." Essam is convinced he and others were marked men and women at Tahrir Square that day. For weeks, Essam had sung and played his guitar for large crowds celebrating the end of the Mubarak regime. Moments before he was detained, several men pointed him out to soldiers, he said. Essam was released, but human rights groups have said more than 100 innocent activists -- ­ all detained on March 9 -- are still in custody awaiting military trials without access to lawyers. Their stories are almost identical to ­those of protesters who claim they did nothing wrong, but were illegally detained and often beaten by thugs and soldiers. "It's disgusting. It's inhumane," said Cairo based human rights lawyer Ragia Omran. "Basically, there were plainclothes thugs or informers who were pointing out to the military the people who come to Tahrir Square, and that's how people got picked up." In a joint statement released this week, nine Egyptian human rights groups said, "The crime is still going on and the perpetrators deserve a harsher punishment. The junta owes the Egyptian people an apology as they are ruling for the moment." It's impossible to verify who is behind the violence on March 9. Many suspect remnants from the Mubarak regime with links to rogue factions within the Egyptian military. The events of that day, and other accounts of violence involving soldiers, are fueling doubts about the Egyptian armed forces, the same institution promising a peaceful changeover to democracy. Presidential candidate Amr Moussa has said shadowy elements have also fueled recent violence between Egyptian Christians and Muslims. The army has denied the allegations of torture and abuse, and it said anyone in custody is either suspected or accused of breaking the law. Despite the torture he claimed he suffered at the hands of soldiers, Essam said he still has faith in the army's promise of democracy, but his scars are a reminder that the fight for lasting change in Egypt is not over.

With all due respect, thanks but no thanks. That's the message from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles after it was deluged with pizzas. It started all when Lauren Hammersley taped a message to the hospital room window of her 2-year-old daughter Hazel, a cancer patient. "Send Pizza. RM 4112." On Saturday, a Reddit user took a picture of the window from the street. And word spread. Fast. Reddit users, who have a longstanding mission to "restore faith in humanity, one slice at a time" with their "Random Acts of Pizza," delivered. Study: Reddit used by 6% of adult Internet users They leapt in to action for Hazel Hammersley. One pizza arrived. Then another. And another. By the time more than 20 pizzas had been delivered, the hospital had to issue a statement on their website, urging everyone to stop. "You've made a little girl very happy but NO MORE PIZZA IS NEEDED," the hospital said. "The Hammersley family will be going to bed very full and very thankful for the compassion they received today." Hazel was diagnosed in April with Stage 3 neuroblastoma, a type of cancer found predominantly in young children and infants. She will soon begin her fifth round of chemotherapy treatment. On her blog "Our Little Hazelnut," mother Lauren Hammersley wrote: "We have been absolutely humbled and surprised by the outpouring of love and support from the online community and can only hope and pray that this brings awareness to Neuroblastoma and the Childhood Cancer Community." She also said the family was able to share in the fun with other families in their ward. "Several other children and nurses came into the room, with music playing, and had themselves a wonderful Pizza Party," she said. It was a sight that melted hearts like mozzarella.

For three decades or so, Syrian artist Safwan Dahoul has been painting pensive, haunting images -- all of which are titled "Dream". The somber paintings typically depict a downcast, lone woman, painted in shades of gray or muted colors. A celebrated painter, Dahoul had seen his works acquired by the Syrian Ministry of Culture and the national museum in Damascus. But he now lives in Dubai, joining over two million fellow citizens who fled overseas to escape the brutal civil war. When Dahoul moved to the UAE in 2012, he left behind most of his belongings, including many of his "Dream" paintings, at his Damascus home. "I left with only one small bag, thinking I'd return to Syria after a short time," says the 53-year-old artist. Art collector Hisham Samawi and his cousin Khaled Samawi, who run Ayyam Gallery in Dubai, helped Dahoul -- and later his paintings -- leave Syria. The cousins first opened the gallery in Damascus in 2006, but the conflict had forced them to move the headquarters to Dubai around three years ago. Between 2011 and 2013, the Samawis and their team helped more than a dozen Syrian artists relocate overseas, providing them with visas and airfare, and moved about 3,000 artworks to Dubai. "The moment when trouble started happening in Syria, we decided that we needed to plan because if this thing turned ugly, we're not going to have time to do this later," says Hisham Samawi. They also helped 33-year-old artist Tammam Azzam escape to Dubai in September 2011. His work "Freedom Graffiti" -- a digitally manipulated image of Gustav Klimt's painting "The Kiss" superimposed on a photograph of a bomb-ravaged wall in Syria -- went viral last year after the Saatchi Gallery in London shared it on Facebook. Moving artists and their artworks to safe havens such as Beirut, Dubai and Cairo is a costly operation, but Samawi says it is worth it. "We feel like we're a family in Ayyam," he says. "So it was never an option that we're going to cut our ties and move on." But it's not just about rescuing Syrian artistic and cultural treasures, it's also about money. Middle Eastern art is big business, and Dubai is a hub, hosting the region's largest modern art fair. On the first day of Art Dubai last month, Ayyam Gallery sold a "Dream" painting by Dahoul for $150,000. "More and more, we're seeing people engage with artists who are producing work in conflict areas," says Bashar Al Shroogi, art collector and director of Dubai-based Cuadro Fine Art Gallery. "It's because they have a message, it's because they're reflecting back what's happening in the regions. Essentially, they're holding a mirror back to society and saying, 'This is what's going on around me. Do you see what I see?" Dahoul and Azzam are now living in the safe haven of Dubai, but they are still troubled by the bloodshed and destruction in Syria. Dahoul's more-recent "Dream" paintings hint at the atrocities back home: a woman staring at rows of bodies, a body squeezed into a small box. Azzam, whose artworks focus on the devastation back home, says: "I am a completely different person now in my life and my art -- everything has changed." Yenni Kwok contributed to this report.
As the deadline nears for U.S. troops to exit major Iraqi cities, units in Mosul are in the midst of a months-long operation to sweep out extremist fighters. U.S. troops have a deadline of June 30 to exit major Iraqi cities. The decision on whether to keep troops in the restive northern city beyond June 30 has been a sticking point between the United States and Iraq. Parts of the city remain under insurgent control and high-profile attacks continue, unlike the vast majority of the country. "We still have a major operation going inside of Mosul with all forces assisting and helping out. We expect that to end here within about 30 to 45 days, and then there will be a decision to be made," the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Raymond Odierno, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday. "I was just up there Saturday, and we conducted a joint assessment," he said. "There's some problems that we have to work through but, in fact, there's potential that they [Iraqi forces] can handle the mission" when they take over in July. Despite concerns about the continuing violence, the government of Iraq said last week it will not extend the deadline for U.S. combat troops to leave Iraqi cities. The joint operation to clear Mosul of insurgents has been going on for 75 days, neighborhood by neighborhood, according to Odierno. "It's going to take us another 30 days to finish that," he said. Mosul has become the last major fighting ground in Iraq as insurgents, mainly al Qaeda, were pushed north out of Baghdad during the U.S. troop "surge" that started in 2007. Insurgents were able to entrench in the city as U.S. and Iraqi forces cleared and held Baghdad and other regions. A number of U.S. troops were moved out of Mosul to help with surge operations farther south, leaving Mosul and surrounding areas mainly to Iraqi forces and a smaller U.S. military contingent. While Odierno said the current operations are "having a good impact," in Mosul, continued high-profile attacks haunt commanders there. On May 1 a suicide bomb was detonated near a coffee shop, killing at least six people. Five U.S. soldiers were killed on April 10 when a suicide bomber breached the outer security barrier of Iraqi National Police headquarters in southern Mosul. It was the single deadliest attack on U.S. troops in more than a year, the U.S. military said. Odierno noted the tactic of using women as suicide bombers is being used by insurgents in Mosul. "We've seen a few in Mosul -- a couple of attacks were connected by Tunisian foreign fighters that came in, we think, through Syria. We actually detained the leader of the cell, so now we're learning more and more about it," he said. U.S. and Iraqi forces are also facing a recent increase of attacks in Baghdad, which Odierno and other U.S. military officials pin on al Qaeda trying to again foment sectarian violence. "We're trying to get inside of these cells. We're trying to understand where they're coming from and we have been successful. We are picking people up," the general said. He said the United States has improved its intelligence sharing with the Iraqi forces over the past six months, helping to impair the ability of the insurgents to move around. "Their [Iraqi forces'] strength is the human intelligence. Our strength comes in other ways. And so we're trying to combine those together so we can work toward solving this problem," he said. But with 45 days left until the security agreement with Iraq takes U.S. troops in Baghdad off the streets and back to their bases, there is some uncertainty about how Iraqi forces will contain the current violence. Odierno remains positive. "There's a potential that this could actually work, if the Iraqis are able to maintain in the cities and we're able to, then, to spend more of our time in the support zones outside of the cities," he said. "We actually could come up with, actually, a stronger method of going after these forces. But we'll have to wait and see."
In the span of a few days, more than 51,000 people have thrown their support behind a Massachusetts State Police trooper who was temporarily suspended for giving Boston magazine photos of the hunt and capture of one of the Boston bombing suspects. Sgt. Sean Murphy, who was suspended for a day last week for releasing the photos without authorization, will face a closed hearing Tuesday to determine his professional future with the agency, said state police spokesman David Procopio. Boston magazine published what it said were Murphy's images in a story last week. The piece quoted Murphy as saying that he felt the Rolling Stone cover image -- showing a doe-eyed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with tousled hair -- was an insult to the victims of the April bombings. What do you think of the Rolling Stone cover? Boston magazine said it received images that Murphy, a tactical photographer, took of the hunt and capture of the alleged Boston bomber. "I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets," Boston magazine quotes Murphy as saying alongside numerous images, including one of the suspect appearing bloody, looking down, his shirt raised and what looks like a red dot laser trained on his forehead. "This guy is evil," Murphy told Boston magazine. "This is the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine." A day before three commissioned officers will decide if the sergeant will remain on full or restricted duty pending an investigation or suspended with or without pay during a probe, there was very little hair-splitting on "Save Sgt. Murphy" about how people feel. "If the powers that be do the right thing, they'll give Sgt. Murphy a medal, a long weekend off with pay, a new camera, and an apology," Richard C. Martin posted on the Facebook page. His comment alone garnered 160 likes. "I support Sgt Murphy for standing up for the victims," posted John W. Patterson, "he's a true hero for doing what he thinks is right." But there were a few people who understood why the trooper was in trouble. Darin Vance, a 16-year-old from West Virginia posted, "I hate to see him lose his job, but what he did really was illegal; those pictures were not his, since he took them for his employer. Therefore, legally speaking, he stole the picture, and published it. I guess it depends how his contract was set up, but I think all copyrights would have been given over to the state..." Vance reiterated his support for the trooper to CNN Monday and said that he worried that the Rolling Stone cover might inspire someone to commit an act of terror hoping to land on the cover of a legendary magazine. On Monday CNN reached a woman who said she was the organizer of the page but would only give a first name -- Lisa. She said that she felt compelled to create the page because her own father was a Massachusetts State Police trooper. "I thought this page would only be popular among my friends, but I'm getting private messages from people across the country, in Germany and in England, all over, who believe this trooper did the right thing," she said. "I was so angry when I heard that Sgt. Murphy was going to suffer for trying to stand up for victims." Fast Facts: Boston Terror Attack Before quoting Murphy in several long passages, Boston magazine wrote: "Here, in his own words, Murphy shares his thoughts on the Rolling Stone cover. He stresses that he is speaking strictly for himself and not as a representative of the Massachusetts State Police." John Wolfson, Boston magazine's editor in chief, said the magazine has hundreds of photos similar to the ones Murphy provided and will publish more in its September issue. He said Murphy was "conflicted on some level" about releasing the photos, but "genuinely worried" about how the Rolling Stone cover will affect the victims' families. The Rolling Stone cover unleashed a wave of intense reaction on social media, which played out in brick-and-mortar stores. Three prominent New England-based businesses -- CVS pharmacies, Stop & Stop, and Tedeschi Food Shops -- heard the public outcry and announced they would not sell the print edition of the magazine. The 7-Eleven corporation said Thursday its nearly 1,700 company stores across the country won't sell the issue. Read more: Rolling Stone cover called a 'slap' to Boston Some have defended the cover, arguing that it draws much needed attention to a young man who seemed an unlikely terrorist and makes us all reconsider our ideas of what a terrorist would look like. Rolling Stone issued a statement saying that the story "falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage..." "The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers," the statement read, "makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens." Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings and is awaiting trial. His brother Tamerlan, suspected to have helped carry out the attack, was killed during a gun battle with police. Read more: Suspect pleads not guilty CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.
Those Jack Bauer fans just won't give up: The infamous character from Fox's long-running drama "24" was a big trending topic on Twitter late Sunday in light of the Osama Bin Laden news -- no doubt because many were thinking (hoping?) a Bauer-like embed was responsible for the "actionable intelligence" that led to President Obama's press conference. Here's the good news: Kiefer Sutherland could be back on Fox this fall. Now, the bad news: He won't be reprising his role as a counter-terrorism agent. Instead, he's playing a dad whose autistic son can predict events before they happen in a project called "Touch." The drama's from Tim Kring ("Heroes") and is already generating great buzz. But a return of Bauer is still in the cards. A big-screen version of the drama remains in the works at 20th Century Fox, and producer Brian Grazer (whose company, Imagine Entertainment, was behind the TV show) recently acknowledged that he's on board. In March, Sutherland told the women of "The View" that the movie will come out in 2012. Hey Kief: Care to rethink that timeline now? See full article at EW.com.

A twisted boardwalk, a glowing carousel flooded with water and a cresting river breaching its banks. These are among the memorable images from Superstorm Sandy, but they weren't taken with fancy cameras -- they were shot with smartphones and immediately seen around the world via photography app Instagram. On the day the storm came ashore, users shared 800,000 images tagged #Sandy on Instagram. At one point, Instagram reported people were posting 10 Sandy photos per second on October 29, 2012. "During Hurricane Sandy, we saw people along the Atlantic Coast using Instagram to document how the storm was affecting their communities, and to let loved ones know they were OK," Instagram founder Kevin Systrom told CNN this week. "As Sandy made landfall, we saw photojournalists like Ben Lowy documenting in real time the storm's path of destruction. In the immediate aftermath, we saw local residents like Steph Goralnick sharing images that humanized the relief efforts in some of the hardest-hit communities like Rockaway Beach." Goralnick: Let's not forget Superstorm Sandy's victims Instagram reached a saturation point as Sandy hit, and the platform became a storytelling medium for the storm. After that watershed moment a year ago, it seemed apropos to do an Instagram-only project for CNN's anniversary coverage. Instagram friends Tim Lampe and Keith Weaver visited families in some of the hardest-hit areas, photographed intimate portraits of people and their new homes and highlighted the rebuilding efforts along the coast. Lampe is the manager of CNN's Instagram account, and Weaver is an Atlanta photographer. CNN sent Lampe back to New York, armed with an iPhone, and the full experience was only for the Instagram audience. He has 28,000 followers on his personal account and is one of CNN's in-house experts on the platform. Here's what Lampe had to say about this storytelling experiment. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN has never done an original photo and video series housed on Instagram. Why did you choose the Sandy anniversary to embark on this Instagram-only project? Lampe: Sandy itself was the biggest event Instagram had ever seen. Everything unfolded there. My personal experience was that I grew up in the area, and I knew a lot of people who were documenting it on Instagram. The mentality of a big organization like this is that these stories and these photos need to be in a lot of places. We put these stories together exclusively for Instagram, just for that platform, because we saw a lot of value in it. Time magazine photographers ditched their professional cameras for mobile phones to tell the story of Sandy last year. What is your take on news outlets using the storytelling medium of the average person? And, who's doing it well? Lampe: Instagram is a great spot for everyday stories. It started with just seeing what our own people were doing in the field. We have correspondents and producers out in really cool places across the world documenting everyday stories. For example, Patrick Oppmann, our correspondent in Cuba, is documenting stories in Cuba that nobody else is doing. It's not always something that fits in broadcast, but there's a lot of value in seeing that continuing story in Instagram. I like The New Yorker. Almost every week, they let someone take over their Instagram and document where they are, whether they're documenting something as simple as a small town in the U.S. or a war zone in a different country, where life is very different. Looking back at the Instagram images from Superstorm Sandy, there were compelling, verified ones but also false ones. How can we tease out the real from the fake? Lampe: The way that we currently feature images on the CNN account, we're only featuring stuff from CNN folks across the world and featuring images from CNN iReporters. If we're featuring citizen photos, we're going to the team behind CNN iReport and trusting how they verify photographs and stories. Location is one thing to help us verify photos. You can't falsely tag something that's geotagged on Instagram. Seeing the people who it's from is also helpful. If you look at their account if there's a genuine love for storytelling, you can see it in the everyday stories they tell. There's a consistency in how they shoot and tell stories. But with a suspicious account, you can tell because they're posting photos of various quality. Their feed isn't consistent. Some journalism experts say it's not the camera you have, but how you use it that's important. How do you use the phone's camera to your advantage? Lampe: For me, what I love about the mobile phone camera is this fixed-lens mentality. It has its own set of challenges. One of the best things about Instagram is that because of the challenges of shooting on mobile, people look to tell stories differently than they would with a traditional photo outlet. With this project, we did some things that have become popular on the platform. For example, the "dear portrait" is when you hold up a physical photo from the past in a current location. You try to line it up with what's there. You only get one photo or video to tell a story per Instagram post. What are some of the ways to tell long-form stories in this format? Lampe: It seems like because Instagram allows you to post as much as you want that you should post everything that you have. What works best is the idea of restraint: Which photos tell or continue your story the best way. I think portraits tell a story really well even if people don't read the caption below. For example, with the stories from Sandy, I was amazed that when I took peoples' portraits, you could see almost the whole experience of the year in their eyes. I didn't see that until I went back and reviewed the photos. This is the first of many long-form stories we're going to tell on Instagram. It's a huge success on the Instagram platform. We've got a lot of great engagement and would love to be able to tell another set of stories like this again. What are the limitations of working with such a small photo as a storytelling format? Lampe: It's probably the detail because with Instagram, when you're going to take portraits, you want to get close. With the square format, what is in the center is the focus, so you center the persons' eyes and face in the photo. There's no ability to zoom in and out on a photo, so you're presenting what you can in the space give to you. On social media, the tendency is to keep things short, yet you often write long captions on your Instagram posts. What's your rationale for long captions? Lampe: I start long and I reduce, reduce, reduce until I get to the story that needs to be told. From my previous experience in telling long stories on Instagram, I realized people read through the long captions based on the comments they left. The people who follow the CNN account are trained to read the caption, whereas on personal accounts, people see the long caption and are turned away. Fill in the blank: Storytelling magic happens when _______. Lampe: Storytelling magic happens when the subject is at its most comfortable, and you get their best story. The reason why some of these stories were so honest and so true was because they didn't feel like this huge media outlet was on them. They had the freedom to tell their whole story. We did our best to stay true to the stories.
aided by drones overhead -- into an area south of the African nation's capital Mogadishu around 6:20 p.m. (11:20 a.m. ET) Monday. Lower Shabelle Gov. Abdikadir Mohamed Nur Sidii characterized the attack near the port city of Barawe as so ferocious. "It jolted the entire region." "I never heard such a huge and deafening blast as the result of the airstrike," Sidii said. Kirby didn't elaborate on exactly how much firepower was used, beyond that there were multiple Hellfire and laser-guided missiles. Somali intelligence officials counted at least four such missiles. The targets were what the Pentagon spokesman described as "an encampment" and a vehicle inside it, not to mention Al-Shabaab leaders believed to be there. Kirby said that he expects the attack -- like others U.S. forces have conducted against terror groups -- sends a message. "The operation that we've conducted, we believe, is an example of the U.S. government and our allies and partners' commitment to the people and the government of Somalia," he said, "to detect, deter, disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region, as well as threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world." To figure out if the operation achieved its goals, the U.S. military will need help. That's because, Kirby explained, no American forces were on the ground before or after the mission. He didn't specify who would get to the bottom of what happened, saying simply, "We continue to work with partners in the region." U.S. has gone after Al-Shabaab before The United States has previously gone after Al-Shabaab in Somalia. That includes at least two strikes this past year ordered by President Barack Obama's administration. That's part of a long-running, multinational effort targeting the group, including an operation launched last week to cut off the group's supply lines along the Somali coast. Al-Shabaab has been on the defensive of late. Its militants have started to withdraw from the port city of Barawe in recent days. On Monday, the African Union Mission in Somalia announced that military forces had retaken several important towns in the Middle Shabelle and Hiiran regions. But no one is counting Al-Shabaab out quite yet. The group has shown its audacity and violent ways before. It has been blamed, and taken responsibility, for attacks on city streets, at markets, at prisons and a United Nations compound in Mogadishu. It's most high-profile attack came last year at Nairobi's upscale Westgate mall, when terrorists casually walked into the mall, pulled out weapons and began gunning down shoppers. The gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them. As many as 67 people died in the siege, and parts of the mall were destroyed. That and many of these other attacks occurred under Godane's watch. If he's now gone, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said, it would be a serious blow to Al-Shabaab. "Ahmed Godane is a very ruthless figure in the group, he dominates the group," Cruickshank said. "You could see a kind of leadership struggle emerge if, indeed, he was killed." But it wouldn't necessarily be a fatal one. Godane rose to power in 2008, after all, when a U.S. airstrike killed then-leader Aden Hashi Ayrow. "It's a network, and we understand that," Kirby said Tuesday. "We are mindful that there remain other leaders of the organization, at large." What is Al-Shabaab?
Ron Paul supporters were never that trusting of his son, Rand Paul. To ardent Ron Paul legions who energized his bid for the presidency around his libertarian principles, Rand Paul reflected a corrupt, business-as-usual political system -- one that asked people to compromise their beliefs in the quest for power. They saw Ron Paul, a former Texas congressman, rising above that until this week when Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator who is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, blazed his own path toward their hearts and minds. He appealed to civil libertarians at their core by challenging the White House nominee to head the CIA, and pushing the Obama administration to clarify -- not once, but twice -- its policy on targeting Americans in counter-terror operations with lethal force. He threw the faithful a healthy portion of red political meat with a 13-hour filibuster over John Brennan, who was confirmed to the CIA post on Thursday. Brennan was President Barack Obama's chief counter-terrorism adviser. Rand Paul highlighted his dissatisfaction with the response of the administration to his question of whether it could use a drone to kill Americans on U.S. soil. The issue resonates with both libertarians on the far right and liberals on the far left by challenging what they consider to be excessive government powers. In particular, Paul sought clarity that only a war enemy -- even if a U.S. citizen -- could be targeted. His Senate marathon amounted to a libertarian clinic. He quoted libertarian thinkers, emphasized the infallibility of the Constitution and elevated the drone discussion. And Ron Paul devotees noticed. "I think this definitely scored him some points," said Gary Franchi, the former chair of the Revolution PAC. "I was getting a lot of messages from people saying 'Wow, Rand is stepping up.' People were really positive about it." "You have to give credit where credit is due and when someone does something that is clearly fighting for the people's liberty, then regardless of how you feel about that person, you have to take notice," Jordan Page, an ardent Paul supporter and musician for the campaign said. "Rand, these days, is the lone senator standing up against injustice." During the 2012 campaign, Ron Paul wielded great of influence among a small, but fervent, group of supporters. That passion turned into a fundraising operation that even establishment Republican candidates envied. When Ron Paul withdrew from the Republican race, more establishment members of the party saw Rand Paul as the inheritor of his father's following. Many in the Ron Paul movement challenged that assumption. Then Rand Paul began to speak shortly before noon on Wednesday. "I rise today to begin to filibuster John Brennan's nomination for the CIA. I will speak until I can no longer speak. I will speak as long as it takes," he said. Blogs dedicated to the liberty movement, a nickname for the Ron Paul campaign, began to blow up with posts about the filibuster. Radio shows dedicated to Ron Paul scrapped their original programming and covered Rand Paul live. And the hashtag #standwithRand, a tag that has long been used by libertarian supporters of Rand Paul, began to trend worldwide. As the hours ticked by, Rand Paul's image among Ron Paul supporters began to change. Even those who ardently opposed Rand Paul during his father's 2012 campaign for president began to soften. "I was skeptical of Rand Paul from the beginning," said John Bush, a radio host and event organizer for the 2012 Ron Paul campaign. "I appreciate what Rand Paul did last night and I think it sent a very strong message. I have a much higher opinion of him than I did before." The distrust of Rand Paul stems from Senate votes and decisions he made during the 2012 campaign. In particular, Ron Paul supporters have pointed to Rand Paul's support of Israel and use of economic sanctions, which they see as overstepping the bounds of American power, as a few of the many reasons they were skeptical of the junior senator from Kentucky. "The reason why Ron Paul got such a following was because he was pillar with his principles," Mike Salvi, a Philadelphia-based Ron Paul organizer said during the 2012 campaign. "I don't see that in Rand." Distrust deepened when Rand Paul endorsed Mitt Romney for president last July. Many Ron Paul supporters were still angling for influence at the Republican National Convention and were appalled at the decision. They felt the senator betrayed his father, cementing long held skepticism. "Mitt Romney was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Chuck Suter, a Ron Paul supporter who organized events for the presidential campaign. Suter, who supported Rand Paul throughout Ron Paul's presidential campaign, said that the Romney endorsement was incredibly difficult to defend. He said he took heat from outspoken Ron Paul supporters. Suter said that Rand Paul's filibuster provided some vindication. "What last night did for me was it affirmed everything that I had done even when it was hard for me to go out and defend Rand when he endorsed Romney," Suter said. "Last night was the shining jewel of what Rand Paul is all about, to play politics where his father may have not." Hammered by conservatives on Twitter to #StandWithRand, a number of more establishment senators streamed into the Senate to relieve Paul of his speaking duties and support his cause. They included Sen. Marco Rubio, who many see as the frontrunner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and someone who Ron Paul supporters view as anointed by the establishment. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the personification of "establishment" to many Paul supporters, also took part. To many Paul supporters, that sort of high-profile backing was icing on the cake. "Everybody use to say there is no point in working with the GOP because of the mindset that there is no way that you can get Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio to stand on the ... floor like that," Suter said. "Last night changed things." And although Paul has said he won't make a decision about a 2016 race until next year, his prolonged filibuster has warmed the mood among once doubtful libertarians. "I wouldn't mind if Rand Paul was president," said Bush, a voter who said he isn't sure he even support the idea of the presidency. "It would certainly be better than Marco Rubio or Mitt Romney or any of the other goons that the GOP will put up for the nomination."
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation threatened legal action over the online sale of a vial purportedly containing dried blood from the former president following a 1981 assassination attempt. "If indeed this story is true, it's a craven act and we will use every legal means to stop its sale or purchase," said a statement from John Heubusch, the foundation's executive director. Bidding for the vial topped 9,181 pounds (nearly $14,500) as of Tuesday, with two days left in the sale. The item is being offered by PFC Auctions, based on the island of Guernsey, a British dependency. "Dried blood residue from President Reagan ... can be seen clearly in the vial with a quarter-inch ring of blood residue at the end of the inserted rubber stopper," the listing says. On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley fired six shots at Reagan as the president left the Washington Hilton after delivering a speech. Reagan was rushed to George Washington University Hospital for emergency surgery. The vial's seller, in a letter of provenance included in the sale, said it has been in his family's possession since the day of the assassination attempt. "Back in the '70s and '80s, my mother worked for Bio Science Laboratories in Columbia, Maryland," the letter says. The lab was contracted with George Washington University Hospital to handle blood testing, and did Reagan's blood work and testing. "The test tube and the lab slip that I have are for his blood work to be tested for lead on 03/30/1981," according to the letter. "The testing was completed and the test tube was sitting on my mother's desk." The seller says in the listing his mother asked the lab director if she could keep the paperwork and test tube, and was allowed to do so. The seller said his mother and father have both since died. "We've spoken to GW Hospital and are assured an investigation as to how something like this could possibly happen is underway," Heubusch's statement said. "Any individual, including a president of the United States, should feel confident that once they enter into the care of a medical system, their privacy and rights are held inviolable." The hospital declined comment to CNN on Tuesday. The seller said he had contacted the Reagan National Library and spoke to its director, asking if the library would like to purchase the vial. The director said the library would accept the vial as a donation, the seller said, but the director also wanted to check with legal counsel, the National Archives and the FBI, among others. "He called back in 25 minutes and said that everything was OK," the seller wrote. "The National Archives was not interested in what I had, nor was the Secret Service, the FBI and other agencies. Since 30 years had passed by, he thought that it was simply something that was of no importance at this time and that I was free to do ... whatever I wanted with it." The seller said he did not want to return the vial to Reagan's family, "since I had served under Pres. Reagan when he was my Commander in Chief when I was in the Army from '87-'91 and that I was a real fan of Reaganomics and felt that Pres. Reagan himself would rather see me sell it rather than donating it." A form also being sold with the vial contains Reagan's patient ID number at George Washington Hospital, the seller said. The form and a label on the vial contain the names of doctors at the hospital as well, according to the seller. Reagan served two terms as president. He died in June 2004 at age 93. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting, which also wounded then-press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police officer Thomas Delahanty. Hinckley has been a patient at St. Elizabeths mental hospital in Washington for three decades. A hearing was held earlier this year on his request that he be allowed longer visits to his elderly mother's home in Virginia. A judge in February said he would rule on the matter later. CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.
For the first time since their rescue two months ago, the world is hearing directly from the three women who were held captive in Cleveland for a decade. Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight released a video on YouTube, offering their thanks to all those who have supported them since they were freed from captivity. "I want to thank everyone who has helped me and my family through this entire ordeal, everyone who has been there to support us. It has been a blessing to have such an outpouring of love and kindness," Amanda Berry says in the video. Berry was abducted at age 16 in April 2003 and has a 6-year-old daughter, who was born during her captivity. Before and after the kidnappings Gina DeJesus was 14 when she was kidnapped in 2004. She says to the public, "thank you for the support." Michelle Knight, who was abducted at age 21 in August 2002 says, "thank you everyone for your love, support, and donations which helped me build a brand new life. I want everyone to know I'm doing just fine. I may have been to hell and back, but I am strong enough to walk through hell with a smile on my face and with my head held high and my feet firmly on the ground." Feds: 3 in Ohio held woman, child in 'subhuman' conditions The Courage Fund, which was established to help the three victims, has raised more than $1 million dollars. The three women were held captive by Ariel Castro and were beaten, raped and starved for a decade, according to prosecutors. They were freed in May after one shouted for help while Castro was gone from the house. 'Please don't let me go,' victim told officers The women don't plan to make any additional public statements. "I'm getting stronger each day and having my privacy has helped immensely. I ask that everyone continue to respect our privacy and give us time to have a normal life," Berry says. Castro is accused of holding the women in his Cleveland home. He faces 329 counts, including one count of aggravated murder for allegedly causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy. His next pretrial hearing is scheduled for July 24th.
Never have so many been so outraged by so little. We live in a time of instant outrage. The explosion of social media and the demands of the 24-hour news cycle let us immediately express our self-righteous anger about any incident, while the content-desperate media eagerly report -- and repackage -- our rage. Outrage has become conveniently instantaneous. In the years before social media, people who were truly outraged would have to get a piece of paper, type a letter, put it in an envelope, stamp it and drop it in a mailbox. In contrast, today you can use your thumb to type a tweet on your phone and simply click "Tweet." Your rage is communicated to the world. Just this week, we saw instant outrage on full display in response to Seth MacFarlane's jokes at Sunday's Oscars. Amazingly, MacFarlane offended almost every group in America in one show. He was accused of being sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and racist. (It has to be an Oscar record.) Did Oscar organizers possibly hire MacFarlane to trigger our instant outrage for their own benefit? After all, they knew he'd say outrageous things. Any chance they wanted the public backlash to make the show, which has seen ratings woes in recent years, more relevant? (And ratings did rise for Sunday's Oscar telecast 11% in the coveted 18-49 age group.) Make no mistake: Our outrage has value. More recently, comedian Joan Rivers found herself the subject of outrage for a joke she made this week invoking the Holocaust. The media are now filled with people debating the "important" question: Did Rivers go too far? (Will the media ever stop asking that tired question about comedians' jokes?!) Instant outrage, however, is not just reserved for comedians; it crops up all over the news cycle. We saw it this week over Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's new policy banning telecommuting in the company she's been hired to revive, meaning people have to work from the office every day or quit. Twitter lit up: It's outrageous! It even happened to me last weekend when I was on CNN with anchor Don Lemon and playfully joked about Canada. Bingo! My Twitter feed was instantly filled with Canadians incensed that I had the audacity to poke fun at their beloved country. Just to be clear, I have nothing against Canada. In fact, it's my third favorite country in North America. There's so much more: Beyonce's halftime Super Bowl outfit; Hulk Hogan tweeting a photo of his daughter's legs; Kim Kardashian tweeting a photo of her diamond-encrusted gun; NBA star LeBron James wearing a T-shirt that some claim was about devil worship and/or a symbol for the illuminati. I get it. We all want to have our opinions heard. When we are mad about something, we want others to know about it. When we are offended, we want to call out the person who has offended us. I'm no different. But here's the thing: Why not also unleash our collective fury over issues more meaningful than just a comedian's joke or a celebrity's tweet? I'm not suggesting we ignore those -- because even if I did, no one would listen. But in addition to those, take a moment to express your powerful outrage over issues that might tangibly benefit your life and the lives of others. Let's get collectively angry that every nine seconds, a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten. And let's get even angrier that three women a day in the United States are killed by domestic violence attacks. Let's get really pissed that 22% of American children are living in poverty. And please save some (actually a lot) of outrage for Congress, which has become the political equivalent of Lindsay Lohan: We only see it in media coverage doing bad things. Sure, go ahead and be outraged over Joan Rivers' and Seth MacFarlane's jokes if you must, but let's show some anger about the fact that almost 10,000 Americans died in gun violence last year and still Congress hasn't passed a universal background check to ensure that criminals and mentally ill people can't legally buy guns. So let's collectively tweet away about the issues that outrage us, be they stupid comments or Syria, comedians' jokes or the growing income inequality in America. But please don't just reserve all your outrage for celebrities. They simply aren't worthy of it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.
It's December 23, so "let's rumble!" As last-minute shoppers fueled on eggnog scramble for those final gifts for relatives thrice-removed, there's another celebration afoot Tuesday: Festivus. Festivus was introduced in the ninth and final season of "Seinfeld" as a holiday that George Costanza, played by Jason Alexander, begrudgingly grew up with as an antidote to the season's growing focus on consumerism. While the episode originally aired on December 18, 1997, the holiday and its eccentric customs -- like the "feats of strength" and "airing of grievances" -- live on with much fanfare. "Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had -- but so did another man. As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!" George's father, Frank Costanza, played by Jerry Stiller, explained in the episode. And so a "Festivus for the rest of us" was born. The Twitterverse is rife with Festivus references this time of year. "HAPPY FESTIVUS!" Alexander exclaimed Tuesday on the site. "May ur pole be straight, ur feats be strong & your grievances be few. With love from the Costanzas - Frank, Estelle, George." Festivus has even spawned literature like a 2005 guide to the holiday called "Festivus: The Holiday for the Rest of Us." Despite the absurdity of it all, Seinfeld writer Dan O'Keefe said he, in fact, grew up with this peculiar holiday of his own father's creation, and the "airing of grievances" into a tape recorder was a real part of it. However, the pole and the father-son wrestling match were made for TV. "I was not forced to wrestle my father. If I had, I would've been raised by the state of New York," O'Keefe told CNN in a 2013 interview about the "feats of strength" that appear in the episode. Much like Costanza, O'Keefe didn't want the tradition to leave the family circle. "I didn't want to put it on TV because it was sort of a family disgrace," O'Keefe joked. But when the show's other writers and Jerry Seinfeld caught wind of it from O'Keefe's brother, majority opinion prevailed. Fellow writer Jeff Schaffer came up with the Festivus aluminum pole, which fans can now purchase online. The real symbol was a clock in a bag nailed to the wall, which O'Keefe says his father still hasn't explained to him. "I thought it was going to be the most forgettable part of it that was cut out for syndication," O'Keefe said. Instead, the pole and the holiday took on a life of their own. And that is a Festivus miracle. "Seinfeld" at 25: Five reasons nothing is everything
France lock Sebastien Chabal has been cited for a dangerous tackle on England's Simon Shaw during Saturday's World Cup semifinal in Paris. Simon Shaw offloads despite being tackled by Raphael Ibanez, left, and Sebastien Chabal. The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous during hosts France's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Friday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, France coach Bernard Laporte said that the defeat was tougher to take than England's 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. "In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone," said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of junior sports minister in the French government. "They were like the New Zealand of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50." Meanwhile, England -- seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title -- revealed that star kicker Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. "We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked," director of rugby Rob Andrew said. "He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. "The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them. On match night, Jonny was vigilant when kicking for goal that they were actually match balls he was kicking. "The practice balls lose pressure and shape. The whole issue last week, the organizers accepted all six match balls should be used by both sides on the Thursday before game."  E-mail to a friend
Wild Oats XI claimed a sixth victory in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Thursday after producing a record time to see off the opposition. The super-maxi crossed the line with an official time of one day, 18 hours, 23 minutes and 12 seconds to claim victory in the prestigious 628-nautical mile bluewater classic. It broke its own previous record of one day, 18 hours, 40 minutes and 10 seconds, which it set back in 2005. It also won the race every year from 2005-08 and in 2010 but last year was narrowly beaten by Investec Loyal, which finished a distant second this time under the new name of Ragamuffin Loyal. "Last year we were beaten by by three minutes, which was very disappointing. This year we beat them by much more," skipper Mark Richards told the race's official website after coming home with 45 nautical miles to spare. The record had looked like slipping out of his grasp as conditions lightened going up the Derwent River, but Richards ordered a bigger mainsail to keep momentum going. "We just kept chipping away. You expect it to be light in the Derwent and it did get lighter towards the end. This is a very testing event and the Derwent is very, very, testing. It's always a tough race," he said. "We had some very hard and fast running conditions; we blew out a spinnaker and had some gear failure, so it wasn't all smooth sailing." Most of the crew have been together since 2005, with Steve Jarvin celebrating his 25th race with a record 10th line honors victory. Official race website Wild Oats became only the second boat in the event to break its own record. "We'll try to do it again next year," owner Bob Oatley said. "New wings on the keel helped enormously I'm sure, so did the new jib. The design, the crew, the sails and the modifications are what makes the boat fast." Ragamuffin Loyal, skippered by 85-year-old Syd Fischer, was confirmed in second ahead of Lahana after being cleared of making an early start on Wednesday. An international jury ruled Friday that race officials had failed to inform Fischer that he had jumped the gun. Fischer was left to rue problems with damaged headsail equipment on the first night of the race. "We had a bit of trouble," he said after finishing his 44th Sydney-Hobart in one day, 23 hours and eight minutes and 44 seconds. "We're new to the boat, we've only had it two months. I think we did pretty well. The boys pushed the boat really hard, it's just unfortunate that things broke or went wrong." The race, being held for the 68th time, is known as one of the toughest in the world. The 1998 edition ended with just 44 of the 115 entries completing the journey, as five boats sank and six people died. Living Doll was the first yacht of the 76-strong fleet to withdraw from this year's event, suffering a broken rudder near the middle of Bass Strait, 90 nautical miles north east of Flinders Island. "The Race Committee has been advised that the crew are all in good shape and that they are managing by themselves. They have not asked any other yacht to stand by," the Sydney-Hobart website reported Thursday. It was followed by Primitive Cool (damaged mainsail) and Corporate Initiatives, which developed steering issues.
Hey, big spender. New Year's Eve is coming up fast, but there's still time to think about an unforgettable getaway to usher in 2012. Maybe this is the year for the trip of a lifetime or perhaps you're looking to be somewhere out of the ordinary when the clock strikes midnight. If so, here are six luxurious itineraries that require deep pockets, but will set the tone for an amazing New Year. Can't make it this time around? Use the list as inspiration for New Year's Eves to come. Secluded Hawaii Celebrate in your own (almost) private paradise, far away from any crowd. It takes a 45-minute ferry ride from Maui to get to tiny Lana'i, a former pineapple plantation that has earned the nickname "Hawaii's Most Enticing Island." You might not be able to rent the whole place for yourself, like Microsoft founder Bill Gates did for his wedding, but you can sip champagne at midnight at the Four Seasons Lana'i at Manele Bay resort. "It would be a very exclusive, quiet New Year's celebration," said Janice Hough, an agent with All Horizons Travel in Los Altos, California. "The service is incredible. It's very much a get-away-from-it-all trip, although you're still in the U.S." Rooms start at about $775 a night. The resort is offering a New Year's Eve prix fixe dinner for $125 per person and will treat guests to a special fireworks show over Hulopo`e Bay. Luminous Santa Fe This adobe wonderland at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in New Mexico draws art lovers, foodies and outdoor enthusiasts all year round. But Hough noted the destination is especially beautiful during the holidays with "farolitos" -- or lanterns -- placed along the Santa Fe Plaza and the city's art gallery district. "It's very pretty and very easy to get to. ... You're also not that far from skiing," she said. There are plenty of posh accommodations to ring in the New Year in style. Hough recommended staying at the Encantado for a "resorty, out-of-town experience" or the Rosewood Inn of the Anasazi in the heart of the city near the Plaza. Rates for both start at several hundred dollars a night around New Year's Eve. Mega-yacht in St. Barts Join celebrities and billionaires who spend New Year's Eve partying aboard yachts moored in St. Barts' famed Gustavia Harbor. Stars like Demi Moore, Beyonce and Salma Hayek have been spotted celebrating on the Caribbean island in recent years, taking in the fireworks at midnight and staying to get a suntan on New Year's Day. Don't have your own ship? No worries. SeaDream, which offers cruises on luxury "mega-yachts" that carry up to 112 passengers, is sending both of its ships to the picturesque harbor on the big night as part of itineraries that also take you to other parts of the Caribbean. "You feel like you're on a yacht yourself rather than a big cruise ship," said Sue Bryant, a contributing editor for CruiseCritic.com, who has sailed on the SeaDream II. She praised the ship's "foodie" cuisine and attentive service. "The first day we were sunbathing on deck, somebody tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Ms. Bryant, may I polish your sun glasses?' I've never had anyone say that before." The voyages start at about $5,000 per person. Romantic Vienna There is something magical about Vienna during the holidays, but the city on the Danube really goes all out for New Year's, with elegant galas and an imperial ball to mark the occasion. For a classic experience, stay at the famous Hotel Sacher, located next to the Vienna State Opera. You can start your night there with a 6-course New Year's Eve gala dinner, which features dishes such as beef consommÃ© with truffle-celery ravioli and turbot with lobster jelly. For 364 euros per person (about $486), the hotel also offers a package that will take you from the festive meal right to the Kaiserball -- a grand ball in the Hofburg Palace, the former residence of Austria's monarchs. On New Year's Day, music lovers who have been lucky enough to score a ticket can attend the elegant "Neujahrskonzert" -- the New Year's Concert at the Vienna Philharmonic, where Strauss waltzes rule the program. African desert adventure New Year's Eve celebrations usually involve crowds, but this getaway to Morocco will have you and a select group of adventurers marking the occasion in the Sahara, away from most signs of civilization. The journey begins in Fez and continues to the oasis city of Erfoud, said Mary Ann Ramsey, president of Betty Maclean Travel in Naples, Florida, who arranges the trips through Abercrombie & Kent. Traveling by four-wheel drive and by camel, you go out into the desert and the huge Erg Chebbi sand dunes. Guests spend the night in a luxury tented desert camp -- an experience Ramsey described as "incredible" and "spectacular." "To me, that would be the coolest place to be for New Year's Eve," Ramsey said. "I've had people go out there to propose. ... It is the most romantic and fabulous [experience] -- the stars are their own fireworks. There are so many stars because there's nothing nearby." The full itinerary costs about $13,460 per person, an Abercrombie & Kent spokeswoman said. Caribbean fantasy Ready to be whisked off for an over-the-top experience? This "Fully Loaded" New Year's Eve package at the Gansevoort Turks and Caicos resort starts at $100,000. That price includes private jet service to and from the island of Providenciales, accommodations in the oceanfront penthouse suite and your own on-call spa therapist for massages, yoga and other treatments. On the big night, you take a luxury catamaran excursion to a secluded cove, where a personal chef prepares your meal, a personal conch diving instructor takes you out for an underwater adventure, and a personal videographer films your journey. You'll usher in 2012 while "glamping" (that's camping with a glamorous twist) in a luxury tent. The Gansevoort Turks and Caicos resort was among the winners of TripAdvisor's 2011 Travelers' Choice awards -- chosen by the site's members as one of the top 10 trendiest and most relaxing hotels and in the world.
The sound of heavy weapons and machine gun fire echoed through the night in the restive city of Al-Rastan after a large number of tanks moved in to block key roads and areas of town, an opposition activist said Monday. "Several tanks have been in place since May at each of the entrances of the city, but Sunday a great number of tanks began blocking the agriculture parts of the town and the surrounding villages and even took positions inside Rastan," said the activist, a member of the opposition Local Coordinating Committees who could not be identified because of security concerns. Elsewhere in Syria, security forces captured and killed two activists in Qosair, a town in Homs province, according to the Local Coordinating Committees, the activist group that has been organizing anti-government protests. Students also continued their protests against the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, chanting, "No teaching, no learning until the fall of the regime" in Homs, Daraa and Damascus provinces. In Al-Rastan, more than 50 tanks were in and around the city in the northwestern part of Homs province, said the activist, whose claims could not be independently verified. The inflow of security forces means opposition groups are having trouble treating their wounded, the opposition activist told CNN. "We have a major problem now that even though Rastan has one of the largest hospitals in Homs province we are unable to take our wounded out of fear of retaliation by security forces. Currently five to six tanks surround the hospital and we believe they may detain the wounded," the activist said. People are scared to go to work in the area's industrial port because it has been surrounded by tanks and "just this week a young man was shot and killed by security forces," the activist said. The Syrian government has been battling opposition activists for months in what the government calls a campaign against terrorists. At the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Moallem blamed "foreign incitement" for the troubles, which he said were fueled by U.S. and European sanctions. "This course cannot in any way be reconciled with pronouncements about concern for the interests, security and rights of the Syrian people," Moallem told the General Assembly. "It further runs counter to the basic principles of human rights in defense of which these states base their interference in our internal affairs." He said Syria had been "a model of peaceful co-existence" among its people's religious and ethnic groups, and that disturbing that peace was aimed at "spreading Western hegemony over the countries of the Mediterranean and serving Israel's expansionist interests." On Monday, the state-run news agency SANA published a report citing an unnamed military source saying that authorities found Israeli weapons, explosives and stolen military uniforms in Homs and recovered weapons, ammunition detonators and other military supplies hidden in a drum and a water tank in the garden of a house in Naseeb, a city in Daraa province. Military engineers also dismantled an explosive device next to Daraa University that could have killed more than 300 people, SANA reported. Nearly 3,000 people have died in the government's crackdown, according to some accounts. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.
Many computer engineers consider a job offer from Google as the golden ticket. Outdoor volleyball courts, free gourmet food, on-site haircuts, massages and laundry are among the perks Google has offered its employees at its main campus in Mountain View, California. But some of the people who do leave are challenging the company in the best way an engineer knows how: by developing programs that could detract from Google's core business. Brian Kennish worked at Google for seven years, managing teams of engineers on a variety of products such as the Chrome browser and the moribund Google Wave. Near the end of his stint at Google, Kennish developed a browser extension for Chrome called Facebook Disconnect. The software blocks websites that have Facebook widgets installed from automatically sending information about the user back to the social networking company. Facebook Disconnect has 75,000 users, Kennish said. "No one at Google asked me to do it," Kennish told CNN this week. What sparked Kennish's project, he said, was reading the recent scrutiny of online data-collection tactics chronicled by news organizations. The Wall Street Journal has been running a series called "What They Know," and CNN had its own last week called "End of Privacy." While Facebook and the applications that run on its platform can be considered personal-data hoarders, Kennish eventually realized his then-employer was, itself, among the biggest collectors. To name a few practices, Google can track search queries over time, target ads to its Gmail users based on the contents of e-mails, and use a person's location data to determine which shops' ads it will show. Google, like many Web advertising companies, uses small files called cookies to track internet surfing habits in order to better target ads. "I never worked directly with user data," Kennish said of his time at Google. "I didn't have a good sense of what was being collected. Privacy wasn't a passion of mine or something that I knew a lot about until basically two months ago, when I started reading about this stuff." Kennish left Google in November to focus more on programs that empower people to take control of their privacy online. "I had this holy-cow moment when I realized what was going on," Kennish said. "There's just so much unknown about what's being done with this data." "I think there is a good reason to be concerned with it all and, frankly, to be fearful of it," he said. Last week, he released a second browser extension, another tool for Google Chrome, called Disconnect. Once installed, the program blocks major internet companies, including Google, from installing cookies on -- and thus tracking -- a computer. People using Disconnect can decide which cookies they'd like to allow onto their system. Cookies can be helpful when, for example, you'd like a website to remember your login credentials and not ask for them every time you visit. "I would like to see us move to a point where all the data that's collected about folks is intentional," rather than without people's knowledge, Kennish said. "So if I give you permission to collect my data, then go ahead and do it." In its first week, 25,000 people downloaded Disconnect. Kennish is releasing a new version Friday that lets users choose whether Google can personalize search queries based on the data it has about the person. By default, Disconnect blocks Google from doing this. "Any data that's collected has the potential to escape the collector," Kennish said. "So I would like to see Google only collect data that I explicitly allow them to collect." Google hosts a dashboard for users to review a breakdown of the messages and information attached to their accounts. The Google Privacy Center provides information on how the company collects data and lets people, whether they're registered with Google or not, opt out of ad and analytics tracking. Michael Gundlach, another ex-Google engineer, developed an alternative to complicated opt-out systems that vary between ad networks. Like Disconnect, it's a browser extension, and there are versions for Chrome and Apple's Safari. Called AdBlock, Gundlach's program can prevent Web pages from loading and displaying ads. That includes Google's ads, which account for the vast majority of the search giant's revenue. AdBlock offers a setting to easily enable ads from Gundlach's former employer, though those ads are disabled by default. "Google didn't ask me to put that in," Gundlach wrote in an e-mail. "I find Google text ads to be useful." Still, Gundlach says he blocks most ads because "I don't wish to be bombarded by consumerism." The real economic conundrum: If website visitors don't pay figuratively -- by watching ads or by having their personal information sent to advertisers -- they may have to start paying real money for online services. Kennish plans to devote six months to developing Disconnect and will reevaluate then whether it could be a sustainable business. He's "pretty close" to releasing an extension for Safari and recently began working on one for Firefox, he said. If he's forced to abandon the project, the source code is freely available to any enterprising developers who want to take up the cause. "The only business model I see," Kennish said, is to eventually provide a more advanced version of the software that costs money. "When I use something like Google, I'm paying for Google with my attention and my data," he said. "There's no such thing as free. These are companies that have to pay employees' salaries." Parts of Google's maturing business may clash with some of the wide-eyed engineers it hopes to attract, especially those passionate about taking risks to change the world, hopefully for the better. But a Google spokesman, who declined to comment on most questions pertaining to this story, said the company's attrition rate -- that is, the percentage of employees that defect -- hasn't changed in more than seven years and is better than the industry standard. In addition to all the on-campus amenities, a program called "20% Time" lets Google engineers devote a sizable chunk of their work weeks to projects of their choosing. (Kennish said he developed Facebook Disconnect after work hours.) The perks haven't stopped some high-profile people from leaving the company. Product designer Douglas Bowman left in a huff last year for a job at Twitter after reportedly becoming fed up with nearly three years of what he publicly described as Google's design-by-committee mentality. Some notable Google alumni are spiting their former employer in a different way -- by joining Facebook. The social network is perceived by some as Google's biggest rival. People are spending more of their time online using Facebook. They're thumbing through photos and asking questions to friends, rather than searching the wider Web. Google is unable to crawl most of the data posted to Facebook. As Google-to-Facebook defections grow,  Google is reportedly offering some employees multimillion-dollar packages to convince them not to go to Facebook. After wooing executives who worked on Google-owned YouTube, Android and advertising; the architect of Google Maps; and at least two Gmail co-founders, this week, Facebook claimed Paul Adams, a former Google employee who was previously an outspoken critic of the social network. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's venerable chief operating officer, also came from the big G. But abandoning Google hasn't always proved to be a wise or permanent move. Anna Patterson left the company in 2007 to start a rival search engine called Cuil. When that tanked, she returned to Google in September.
At least 41 people were killed and dozens wounded in a blast Monday at a security forces checkpoint in northwest Pakistan, authorities said. A girl places flowers at a shrine to army soldiers killed by militants who stormed Pakistan's army HQ. About 45 people were injured in the explosion in the Shangla district in the volatile Swat Valley, said Syed Altaf Hussein, a senior government official in the area. The explosion targeted a military vehicle, officials said. The blast is the latest in a string of attacks in the country. On Saturday, militants attacked the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, killing 11 military personnel and three civilians, according to the Pakistani military's press office. Nine militants died in the attack. A total of 39 hostages were freed Sunday morning after being held by five militants at the army headquarters. In a news conference Monday, the top spokesman for the Pakistani military said Saturday's attack was planned by the Taliban based in South Waziristan. Gen. Athar Abbas said intelligence agents intercepted a phone call in which Pakistani Taliban commander Wali-ur Rehman was informed about the start of the attack. Rehman responded by calling for a prayer for the operation to succeed, Abbas said. Abbas said the leader of the operation, who was captured alive, is from Pakistan's Punjab province. Four other militants were from Punjab as well. Five others were from South Waziristan. During the standoff, two of the militants held 22 hostages in a small room, Abbas said. One of the militants wore a suicide vest connected to a mine and a bomb. He sat in the middle of the 22 hostages. Abbas said this room was the focus of the operation and security forces were successful in storming the room and killing the militant with the suicide vest before he could detonate his bombs. Military officials said they have tightened security around army headquarters. The attacks will not deter Pakistan from launching an offensive in South Waziristan, the Interior Ministry said. South Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. Intelligence analysts consider it a haven for Islamic militants who have launched attacks in Pakistan and targeted U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan. A date for the offensive in the area has not been announced. The Shangla district east of Mingora is one of the areas where the military conducted search-and-destroy operations earlier this year. Troops targeted terrorist hideouts and reported the arrest of one militant leader and the death of another. Mingora is the largest city in the Swat Valley, where the Pakistani military is battling Taliban militants for control. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.
Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it. Ben Folds was so impressed by a cappella groups' performances of his songs, he made a record with them. The singer-songwriter says he was beyond impressed when he stumbled across videos of university a cappella groups singing covers of his songs on YouTube. "I was really moved," he says. "I thought it was better than what I had done when I first heard it. That's how it struck me because it was so fresh." And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers. The North Carolina native picked 15 ensembles from 250 submissions for "Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!" (Epic), which came out Tuesday. And to give the music a "field recording" feel, he kept the process simple: Each performance was recorded using six wide-range microphones, and most of the groups got it down in one or two takes. "It's a completely different point of view," says Folds, 42, of the students' renderings of his tunes. "They're not signed singers and artists that have their egos to contend with. And sometimes they're not thinking about the song that much, which I think is kind of cool." But not wanting to have the thunder completely stolen from him (and probably to entice his loyal fans to shell out for the album) Folds sings two a cappella tracks himself: "Boxing" from his Ben Folds Five days, and "Effington" from his 2008 solo album "Way To Normal." "It was really difficult because we were doing my tracks from the bottom up," he says. "We didn't have a bunch of people to work with and I just about gave up." Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Is this the one and only Ben Folds greatest hits album? Ben Folds: I think it naturally kind of is. I mean I was looking for something like that -- to possibly do a live orchestral album where the best material would kind of float to the top. But then again, someone's going to want to release a greatest hits soon, so this is the other greatest hits. CNN: Did you learn anything from the students? Folds: Yeah. I relearned a lot of stuff. ... This is all so old school. I mean these guys, they'd just do a live take and they just don't know that the pros don't do it that way. I mean, professional singers are a nightmare. You've gotta tune every syllable, they have to do it 10,000 times. These guys just did it. CNN: And you went around each campus to record each track? Folds: We kept them in what I would say is their natural habitat. I was really into the field recording idea. When you start messing with it and putting everyone on separate tracks you've lost the event and you've gained some sense of maybe perfection, but when it comes to the human voice, even-tempered piano tuning sounds incorrect to me. I think that people have a natural tuning mechanism. CNN: You've always been very Internet savvy. You've embraced MySpace. Do you Twitter? Folds: I'm not sure what that is. There's always something new. I think that my fans knew how to use computers before most people's fans. I remember when everybody was talking about the possibility of downloading, and I was already having kids walk up with CDs they had burned for me to sign. This was like 1999. I was signing burned CDs more than I was signing my own. So I think they get it. CNN: Why did you decide to leak a fake version of your 2008 album "Way To Normal?" Folds: Well, I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there's a process, an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record, mostly. And it also has to do with people's general take on music and how it's framed. I felt if something went out that was a joke and it was riding on the press of a new album, that we would be forced to go in and do something so quickly that we couldn't monitor ourselves. So while I thought it was funny, I really liked the idea of going into the studio and making six songs in one day. So we wrote and recorded six songs in a day, mixed that day while we played our gig that night. And then it was mastered the next day. And then we leaked it the third day. So in three days we wrote, recorded, mixed, mastered, distributed and did press on an album. I think things were kind of cool. CNN: You've been married four times. Is that helpful for singer-songwriter purposes? I mean, that's a lot of drama. Folds: Well, it wasn't a lot of drama, really. ... Everyone's life is different and I think the pace at which I've lived and the way that I tend to take a risk all contributes to the way that I write. ... If you've got kids it is a drama. But it's the kind of drama you want to not write a song about. Because one, the kids will hear it and secondly, I don't like country music. CNN: How has having kids changed your outlook on music? Folds: I have to work more quickly and more efficiently. CNN: Who are you listening to at the moment? Folds: I'm in a habit of buying old 78 [rpm] records and I've got a little record player I'm carrying with me. CNN: That's heavy. Folds: Yeah, that's heavy, dude. CNN: I meant physically heavy -- to carry around a record player. Folds: Oh, that too. I wouldn't know about that with my (jokingly flexes muscles) -- it doesn't really occur to me, those things.
Text messages sent from Trayvon Martin's cell phone the day he was killed show he had been arguing with someone on the phone and was "hostile," attorneys for George Zimmerman wrote in a recent court filing. Zimmerman's lawyers argue the texts are relevant to the case, in which the unarmed teenager was fatally shot by the neighborhood watch volunteer during a confrontation in a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood in February 2012. The texts speak to Martin's demeanor and emotional state, the Thursday filing said, and "may assist the jury in understanding why Trayvon Martin chose to hide then confront George Zimmerman rather than simply going home." The filing said the texts were mostly with "Witness 8," and the messages showed Martin and the friend were "hostile and angry with each other at various points throughout the day." Martin, 17, was talking on the phone with Witness 8 when he and Zimmerman met as Martin walked to the house of his father's fiancee after a trip to a nearby convenience store. Zimmerman to argue self-defense, will not seek 'stand your ground' Also in the document, Zimmerman's attorneys say the court should also consider text messages sent before that day, because they establish Martin's marijuana use and fights he had been involved in. "This (fighting) evidence is admissible in support of Mr. Zimmerman's self-defense claim regarding the abilities and capacity of Trayvon Martin as an experienced fighter," Zimmerman's attorneys wrote. The attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, said Thursday that evidence and other details -- like the defense's assertion that Martin had removable gold tooth caps -- are "irrelevant." He predicted they would never be used at Zimmerman's trial. "Is the defense trying to prove Trayvon deserved to be killed by George Zimmerman because (of) the way he looked?" Crump asked in a statement. "If so, this stereotypical and closed-minded thinking is the same mindset that caused George Zimmerman to get out of his car and pursue Trayvon, an unarmed kid who he didn't know. The pretrial release of these irrelevant red herrings is a desperate and pathetic attempt by the defense to pollute and sway the jury pool." Two previous gag order requests by the prosecution have been denied. George Zimmerman's brother apologizes for offensive tweet Instead, he said, jurors will focus on Zimmerman's arrest for battery on a police officer, a domestic violence injunction and other issues he said demonstrate a "propensity for violence." Other items taken from Martin's phone included text-message discussions of drugs and pictures of a gun and marijuana plants. Lead defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he will try to use the evidence if prosecutors attempt to attack Zimmerman's character during his trial on second-degree murder charges, set to begin next month. Also Thursday, O'Mara filed a request that his client's trial be delayed. Much of the new evidence disclosed Thursday in filings by Zimmerman's attorneys comes from Martin's cell phone, including photos showing a semiautomatic pistol and ammunition and small marijuana plants growing in pots. In another picture, Martin is pictured making obscene gestures in an apparent self-portrait. Others show him with friends and in other settings. Gun, drug texts feature in new Trayvon Martin shooting evidence Zimmerman recently waived his right to a pretrial hearing under Florida's "stand your ground" law, which allows people to use deadly force when threatened regardless of where they are. His attorneys will claim self-defense at trial. A representative of the special prosecutor handling the case did not return an e-mail message Thursday seeking comment on the evidence. Prosecutors renewed their motion for a gag order in the case Thursday because, they said, they're concerned about finding an impartial jury given the "inordinate amount of media coverage." Two previous gag order requests by the prosecution have been denied. Arrest 'solely to placate the masses," Zimmerman's mother writes In-Session's Jessica Thill and CNN's David Mattingly, Marylynn Ryan, Rich Phillips and Dana Ford contributed to this report.
A 34-year-old man originally charged in the kidnapping of a New Hampshire teen is now facing 205 additional charges, according to two grand jury rulings. Nathaniel E. Kibby, arrested in July and charged with one count of felony kidnapping, is facing a litany of charges including aggravated felonious sexual assault, witness tampering, second degree assault, criminal threatening, felonious use of a firearm, indecent exposure and kidnapping. Court papers released Wednesday say Kibby showed the victim a rifle and told her he could hurt her family, bystanders and police if she provided information about his identity. Additionally, Kibby is accused of forcing the victim to wear an anti-bark shock dog collar for a period, scarring her neck. CNN does not report the names of alleged sexual assault victims. The kidnapping case drew national attention when the then-14-year-old victim went missing in fall 2013. Two months after her disappearance, a letter purported to be from the missing teenager was sent to her mother, sparking fears she could be in danger. The mystery deepened about her ordeal when she turned up safe more than nine months after she was last seen with few additional details given by authorities. Kibby will be arraigned on January 8 in Coos County, where the victim was held, and January 9 in Carroll County, where the victim was taken, according to prosecutors. In a statement released after her return in July, the victim thanked those who searched for her while she was missing. "My gratitude is beyond words. It's an incredible feeling to be home and I believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release," she said.
TV's newest crime thriller, "The Bridge," is taking viewers to a volatile place most have only seen on the news: The U.S.-Mexican border. FX goes beyond the headlines with a series that aims to give a new twist to the serial killer storyline by setting it against the backdrop of a tumultuous border town. Named after the Bridge of the Americas that connects El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the show explores the real-world tensions along the border through the story of two detective agents -- one from the United States and one from Mexico -- who must work together to hunt down a serial killer who is terrorizing citizens on both sides. The series is an adaptation of a Scandinavian drama called "Bron," and is brought to life for the American audience by creators Meredith Stiehm ("ER," and "Cold Case") and Elwood Reid ("Cold Case" and "Hawaii 5-0"). Like "Bron," "The Bridge's" pilot episode opens with a gruesome murder and a body splayed in the middle of the bridge joining both nations. This time, however, the murder involves an American judge with anti-immigrant ties. El Paso detective Sonya Cross (Diane Kruger) and Chihuahua state police detective Marco Ruiz (Demian Bichir) form an unlikely pair of agents whose investigation and relationship examines the hot topic of immigration while shedding light on the varying cultural experiences of both border towns. The series also addresses the powerful drug cartels and rampant corruption plaguing Mexican police. Filmmaker Gerardo Naranjo, known for his critically-acclaimed drug trafficking film "Miss Bala," directed the pilot episode and told CNN the drama's authentic take on the U.S.-Mexican border is what sets it apart from other productions. For example, the series embraces dialect as an important component of the story. Much like the real-life fluidity of language alongside the border, "The Bridge" incorporates Spanish when set in Ciudad Juarez and adds English subtitles. There is even the occasional use of a mix of both languages (aka Spanglish). Aside from being a Mexican national, Naranjo brought a wealth of border knowledge to the director's chair. He spent close to three years interviewing criminals and researching the conflict in preparation for 2011's "Miss Bala." "We tried to be as honest as possible," Naranjo said. "It is not about making Mexico look good or bad, it is about what is the truth. Many people who are ignorant of Mexican issues are going to learn about certain realities through our show." At the New Generation Latino Consortium Media, Marketing and Entertainment Conference (NGLC) in early June, Bichir echoed the sentiment. "I had a conversation with my producers and writers and that was the first thing that got me hooked on it -- the promise of it being real," he said. The show's premiere coincides with a real event currently brewing in Washington. With the passage of a bill in the U.S. Senate earlier in the month that aims to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, the immigration debate re-entered the public discourse. Crucial to the passage of the bill was an amendment to strengthen border security by adding 20,000 more border agents and 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico. "The Bridge's" setting alongside the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez border allows the show to seamlessly navigate between both the entertainment and political world. Given this political relevancy and the Latino undertones of the drama, FX took the opportunity to launch a hyper-targeted campaign in an effort to cater to the 48 million TV viewers Nielsen says identify as Latinos. "When we first starting thinking about the show, we knew we had a huge potential opportunity with the Hispanic audience," Sally Daws, FX's senior vice president of marketing, told CNN. "We understand that the Hispanic market is huge, represented by many cultures and nations of origin. We did our best to utilize materials that spoke in a relevant way to that audience." Naranjo hopes that "The Bridge's" ability to cross multiple borders of language and culture will help spark a national debate about not only the U.S.-Mexican border, but the commonalities shared between the characters -- regardless of their cultural background. 'The Bridge' is a great bet," Naranjo said to CNN. "I hope that this show can begin a good type of controversy and a good conversation." "The Bridge" premieres July 10 PM ET on FX.
Editor's note: CNN executive producer Suzanne Simons is the author of "Master of War: Blackwater's Erik Prince and the Global Business of War." Private contractor Xe flies military personnel in Afghanistan and helps train Afghan border police. The company formerly known as Blackwater, now called Xe much to its chagrin, has been at the center of the contractor debate for years. From the time four of its men were ambushed and murdered in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004, to a shooting involving a team of its men in a Baghdad neighborhood in which at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed in 2007, the company has drawn unwanted headlines. Blackwater owner Erik Prince downsized the company earlier this year when business failed to keep pace with investment. He changed the company's name after the Iraqi government banned it from doing business there. But those who thought contractors were going away under President Obama's administration couldn't be more wrong. According to the Department of Defense, there are some 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan today and more than 132,000 in Iraq. But those numbers aren't an accurate reflection of the total number of contractors because they don't include those working for other government agencies such as the Department of State. Many of those tens of thousands are third-country nationals, meaning they were hired from a third country to go to Iraq. Many earn between $400 and $700 a month; while Americans, particularly those performing dangerous security duties, can earn as much in a day. Despite being kicked out of Iraq, Xe still does a healthy business in Afghanistan, flying military personnel from one location to another and helping train Afghan border police charged with making the country's massive, porous borders more secure. It's one of the many jobs that the U.S. military just isn't staffed to tackle on its own. In fact, the U.S. military today is beefed up by a force of nearly a quarter million private contractors. There are even cases where contractors oversee the contractors. And that's the problem. The U.S. has come to rely on them so heavily, in such a short period of time, that the government has come under fire for not managing them adequately. Even among the eight-member team that makes up the Wartime Contracting Commission, a congressionally mandated effort to review the contracting process in Iraq and Afghanistan, the question of whether the United States needs the contractors isn't even an issue. The issue, rather, is how well the government is managing this massive support force called up in the immediate aftermath of the war in Iraq. In its interim report released this month, the Commission found that "neither the military nor the federal civilian acquisition workforces have expanded to keep pace with recent years' enormous growth in the number and value of contingency contracts." The report also said, "the government still lacks clear standards and policy on inherently governmental functions. The decision has immediate salience given the decisions to use contractors in armed-security and life-support tasks for military units." One of the biggest nightmares for legislators is that the force that has grown into such a critical modern-day military support structure was for a long time operating in a legal gray zone with no clear avenue of justice should something unsavory occur. That has led to some tough work for both prosecutors and the FBI, as they take on the task of investigating allegations of wrongdoing by contractors overseas. Doug Brooks, head of the IPOA, an industry-friendly voluntary organization made up of 62 companies, spends much of his time doing outreach and making sure member companies measure up to the internal standards. "We have the power to kick people out of the association," Brooks said, but that's about where it ends. They can't prosecute anyone.  But to say that there has been no progress on the legal front wouldn't be fair. Legislation has been passed that essentially holds contractors accountable for their actions under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, but with everything in this business, there was a hang-up with that, too.  The legislation was written to cover contractors working in support of the Department of Defense, but there are even more contractors working in support of the State Department and other U.S. agencies. The Special Inspector General for Iraq, Stuart W. Bowen Jr. produced a report in February titled Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience. He then testified before Congress that "the United States government was unprepared and ill-equipped to mount a major contingency relief and reconstruction program in Iraq in 2003. For the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve." He also told members of Congress that the United States relies too heavily on the hired help, testifying that "outsourcing management to contractors should be limited because it complicates lines of authority in contingency reconstruction operations." Something that retired Lt. Gen. Richard Sanchez would undoubtedly agree with.   Sanchez, who led the U.S. military operation in the early days of the Iraq war, has launched an information campaign aimed at bringing more accountability to the debate. He's even called for a truth commission to investigate policies regarding the interrogation of detainees.   Guess what. Contractors were involved in that scandal, too. As for Blackwater, scandal, or the suspicion of it, played a significant role in its downturn. Plagued by lawsuits and federal investigations, the company now called Xe is a shell of what Blackwater was five years ago. Most of Prince's top executives are gone, budgets have been dramatically curtailed and the company has largely returned to its roots, as a training facility for law enforcement and special forces.   Is Blackwater's fate a sign that things are sour in the industry? Hardly. As IPOA's Brooks puts it, they're here to stay, its about time we made it work. "I think the other conclusion that companies have come to is that we're going to be working with the private sector. Nobody wants soldiers to go back to flipping eggs, guarding gates, that kind of thing."
